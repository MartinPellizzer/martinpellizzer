                    <h1>Brachystepis</h1>
<p>Brachystepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mistletoe, is a genus of hemiparasitic plants belonging to the family Viscaraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, evergreen leaves and small, fleshy berries that contain toxic seeds. They typically grow on the branches of host trees, drawing water and nutrients from their hosts while performing photosynthesis. Brachystepis species are found predominantly in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>Their ecological role includes providing food for certain bird species and contributing to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems.</p>
