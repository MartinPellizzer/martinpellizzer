                    <h1>Betula fontinalis var. utahensis</h1>
<p>Betula fontinalis var. utahensis, commonly known as the Utah paper birch, is a subspecies of the paper birch native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a silver underlayer, which is a distinctive botanical feature. The tree typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in mountainous regions. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have doubly serrated margins, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination and seed dispersal.</p>
