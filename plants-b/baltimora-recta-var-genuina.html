                    <h1>Baltimora recta var. genuina</h1>
<p>Baltimora recta var. genuina, commonly known as the genuine straight baltimora, is a rare variant of the baltimora plant characterized by its straight, unbranched stems.</p>
<p>It is native to specific regions with high humidity and nutrient-rich soil, typically found in tropical rainforests. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, clustered, and usually white or pale yellow, blooming during the wet season.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
