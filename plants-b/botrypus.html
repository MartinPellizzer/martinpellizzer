                    <h1>Botrypus</h1>
<p>Botrypus, commonly known as water fern, is a genus of aquatic and semiaquatic ferns belonging to the family Water fern family (Onocleaceae).</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their floating fronds that form dense mats on the surface of freshwater bodies. Botrypus species typically have a rhizomatous growth habit, with roots that anchor them to submerged substrates. Their fronds are often divided into small, finger-like segments, contributing to their delicate appearance.</p>
<p>These plants play an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen for aquatic life.</p>
