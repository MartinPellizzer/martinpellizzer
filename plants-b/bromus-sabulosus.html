                    <h1>Bromus sabulosus</h1>
<p>Bromus sabulosus, commonly known as the sandy brome, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as dunes, grasslands, and disturbed areas. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, and it is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Bromus sabulosus plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
