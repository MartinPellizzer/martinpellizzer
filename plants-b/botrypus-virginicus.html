                    <h1>Botrypus virginicus</h1>
<p>Botrypus virginicus, commonly known as sweet flag, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It has long, narrow, grass-like leaves that grow in dense clusters, often submerged or floating on the surface of wetlands. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically clustered in loose, brush-like clusters along the leaf blades. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Sweet flag is often used in traditional medicine and is an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
