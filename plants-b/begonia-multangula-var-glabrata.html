                    <h1>Begonia multangula var. glabrata</h1>
<p>Begonia multangula var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth begonia, is a striking ornamental plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and glossy, giving it its varietal name "glabrata," meaning smooth in Latin. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is popular among gardeners for its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
