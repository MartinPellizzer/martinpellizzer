<p>Brexia australis, commonly known as the southern brexia, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of southern South America.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly rough texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Brexia australis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
