                    <h1>Bromus tectorum f. glabratus</h1>
<p>Bromus tectorum f. glabratus, commonly known as the smooth cheatgrass, is a variant of the annual bromus species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves and culms, distinguishing it from other forms of cheatgrass. This plant is highly invasive and often establishes itself in disturbed soils, outcompeting native vegetation. Its rapid growth and early maturation allow it to dominate rangelands and reduce biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to its flammable nature, it also contributes to increased fire frequency in arid ecosystems.</p>
