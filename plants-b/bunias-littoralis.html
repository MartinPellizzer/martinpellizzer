<p>Bunias littoralis, commonly known as sea kale, is a hardy coastal plant that thrives in saline and sandy environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its root system is robust, allowing it to stabilize coastal soils and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Bunias littoralis is often found growing along shorelines and in maritime climates.</p>
