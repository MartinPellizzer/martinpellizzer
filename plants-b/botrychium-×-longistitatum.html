                    <h1>Botrychium × longistitatum</h1>
<p>Botrychium × longistitatum, commonly known as the long-stalked moonwort, is a fern native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Botrychium lunaria and Botrychium matricariifolium. The plant features a unique morphology with a slender, upright rhizome and a single, broad, ovate frond that is typically divided into two lobes. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in a distinctive, umbrella-like arrangement called a sorus.</p>
<p>This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
