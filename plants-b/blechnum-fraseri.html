                    <h1>Blechnum fraseri</h1>
<p>Blechnum fraseri, commonly known as the Fraser's holly fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its evergreen fronds that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant features a creeping rhizome with upright, leathery, and often hairy fronds that are divided into lance-shaped segments. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth.</p>
