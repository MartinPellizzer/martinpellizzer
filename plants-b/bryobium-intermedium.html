                    <h1>Bryobium intermedium</h1>
<p>Bryobium intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure composed of a leafy stem and lobed leaves, which are often covered in a layer of fine, waxy secretions. Bryobium intermedium reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporocarps.</p>
<p>Its presence is often an indicator of a healthy, undisturbed ecosystem due to its sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
