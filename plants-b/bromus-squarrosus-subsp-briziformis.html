<p>Bromus squarrosus subsp.</p>
<p>briziformis, commonly known as the bristly brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy, bristly lemma and palea, which give it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets, and its seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in arid and semi-arid regions, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat.</p>
