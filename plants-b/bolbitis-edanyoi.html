                    <h1>Bolbitis edanyoi</h1>
<p>Bolbitis edanyoi, commonly known as the Edanyo's water fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are divided into fine, thread-like segments. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments with high levels of sunlight. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Bolbitis edanyoi is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
