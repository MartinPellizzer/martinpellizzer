<p>Bulbophyllum rugosisepalum, commonly known as the rugged-sepal Bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, hairy, and often rugged-textured sepals, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, tropical environments. Its flowers are usually small and pale, with a subtle fragrance, and it blooms during the rainy season.</p>
<p>The orchid's rhizome is thick and fleshy, adapted for storing water in its natural habitat.</p>
