                    <h1>Brachypodium abbreviatum</h1>
<p>Brachypodium abbreviatum, commonly known as little barley, is a small annual grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with short, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and other open areas.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and rapid growth, it is sometimes considered a weed but is also valued for its use in ecological studies and as a model organism in plant genetics.</p>
