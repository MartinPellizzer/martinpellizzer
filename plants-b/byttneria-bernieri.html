<p>Byttneria bernieri, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Central and West Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its strength and aesthetic qualities. The plant has compound leaves with alternate arrangement and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is also considered an endangered species in some regions.</p>
