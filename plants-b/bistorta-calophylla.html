<p>Bistorta calophylla, commonly known as the purple bistort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features upright, somewhat hairy stems that bear whorled leaves with a distinctive purple-tinged underside. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-purple flowers in late summer, which are followed by dark blue, waxy berries. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in rocky and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Bistorta calophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display.</p>
