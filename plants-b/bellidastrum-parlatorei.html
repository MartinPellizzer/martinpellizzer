<p>Bellidastrum parlatorei, commonly known as the Parlatore's bellflower, is a rare and striking member of the Campanulaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer, adding a unique visual element to its native habitat. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in well-drained, sunny environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Bellidastrum parlatorei is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
