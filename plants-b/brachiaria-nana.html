                    <h1>Brachiaria nana</h1>
<p>Brachiaria nana, commonly known as little barnyard grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Brachiaria nana is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
