                    <h1>Buddleja crispa var. amplexicaulis</h1>
<p>Buddleja crispa var. amplexicaulis, commonly known as the woolly butterfly bush, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves that are often clasping around the stems, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, pale purple to pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is relatively drought-tolerant once established and prefers well-drained soil.</p>
<p>While it is not as showy as other Buddleja species, it is valued for its ornamental foliage and ability to attract pollinators.</p>
