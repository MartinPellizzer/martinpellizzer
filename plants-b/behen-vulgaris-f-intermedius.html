                    <h1>Behen vulgaris f. intermedius</h1>
<p>Behen vulgaris f. intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate castor oil plant, is a variant of the castor plant characterized by its intermediate traits between the standard castor and other subspecies.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual plant native to tropical regions, featuring large, palmate leaves and distinctive spiny calyces. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain toxic, oil-rich seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and industrial applications. Its botanical significance lies in its genetic diversity and potential for breeding programs aimed at improving oil yield and plant resilience.</p>
<p>The species is also studied for its role in ecological systems and its adaptability to various environmental conditions.</p>
