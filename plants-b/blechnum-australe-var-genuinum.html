<p>Blechnum australe var. genuinum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly through underground stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understoreys.</p>
<p>Its fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside.</p>
