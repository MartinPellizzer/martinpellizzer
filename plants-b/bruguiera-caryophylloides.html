                    <h1>Bruguiera caryophylloides</h1>
<p>Bruguiera caryophylloides, commonly known as the mangrove fern, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments, often found in mangrove forests where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. The plant has specialized root systems, including pneumatophores, which allow it to absorb oxygen from the waterlogged soil. Its leaves are typically pinnately compound and adapted to withstand salt spray and tidal inundation.</p>
<p>Bruguiera caryophylloides contributes to the biodiversity of coastal ecosystems and is an important component of mangrove habitats.</p>
