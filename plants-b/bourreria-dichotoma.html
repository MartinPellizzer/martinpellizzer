<p>Bourreria dichotoma, commonly known as the two-branched burr, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by distinctive, spiny fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Bourreria dichotoma is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
