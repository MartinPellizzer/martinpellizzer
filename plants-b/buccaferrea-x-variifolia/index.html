                            <h1>Buccaferrea × Variifolia</h1>
<p>Coral tree, scientifically known as Buccaferrea × variifolia, is a striking ornamental plant native to South Africa. It is celebrated for its vibrant, flame-like flowers that bloom in spring and summer, creating a dazzling display of red, orange, and yellow hues. The tree's feathery foliage and delicate bracts add to its visual appeal, making it a popular choice for gardens and public spaces. Its ability to thrive in a variety of climates has contributed to its widespread cultivation around the world. Despite its beauty, the coral tree requires well-drained soil and full sun to flourish optimally.</p>
