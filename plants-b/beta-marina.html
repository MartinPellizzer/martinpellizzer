                    <h1>Beta marina</h1>
<p>Beta marina, commonly known as sea beet, is a coastal plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are adapted to retain water in salty, windy environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its roots are often harvested for their high nutrient content, making it valuable in both culinary and medicinal contexts.</p>
<p>Beta marina is also used in phytoremediation to help clean contaminated soils.</p>
