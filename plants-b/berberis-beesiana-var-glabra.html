                    <h1>Berberis beesiana var. glabra</h1>
<p>Berberis beesiana var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It features slender, thornless stems and lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but not widely cultivated. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in rocky or well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This variety is less prickly than other Berberis species, making it more suitable for smaller gardens and landscapes.</p>
