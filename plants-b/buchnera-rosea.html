                    <h1>Buchnera rosea</h1>
<p>Buchnera rosea, commonly known as the pink lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a cyanobacterium.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or tree bark. The plant's unique structure allows it to absorb nutrients from both the air and water. Its vibrant pink color comes from the pigments produced by the cyanobacterial partner.</p>
<p>Buchnera rosea plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
