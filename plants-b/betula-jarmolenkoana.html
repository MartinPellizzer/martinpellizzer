                    <h1>Betula jarmolenkoana</h1>
<p>Betula jarmolenkoana, commonly known as the Jarmolenko birch, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and smooth, silver-gray bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in autumn. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This species is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations to high-altitude environments.</p>
