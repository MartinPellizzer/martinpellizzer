                    <h1>Bulbophyllum pergracile</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum pergracile, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a lithophytic orchid, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, often in tropical rainforests. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in a spike. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and rock surfaces.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
