<p>Bolbitis scopulina, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in woodland areas. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Bolbitis scopulina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
