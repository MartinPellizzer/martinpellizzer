                    <h1>Botrychium virginianum var. lanuginosum</h1>
<p>Botrychium virginianum var. lanuginosum, commonly known as the hairy moonwort, is a fern species native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and wetlands. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in a distinctive, umbrella-like shape on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its unique morphology and ecological role in woodland ecosystems.</p>
