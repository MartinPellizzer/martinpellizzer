<p>Bixa excelsa, commonly known as the annatto tree, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and large, palmate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to orange-red fruits, which contain numerous seeds. The seeds are encased in a bright orange-red aril, which is the source of the natural dye used in food and cosmetics.</p>
<p>Bixa excelsa is also valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects.</p>
