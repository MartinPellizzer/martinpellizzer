                    <h1>Bursera multifolia</h1>
<p>Bursera multifolia, commonly known as the Mexican birch or desert olive, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, light-gray bark that resembles birch, and its small, opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain a single seed. Bursera multifolia is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and a slow growth rate, making it a hardy plant in xeriscaped landscapes.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its aromatic resin, which has been used traditionally by indigenous peoples for medicinal and ceremonial purposes.</p>
