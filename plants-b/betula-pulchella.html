<p>Betula pulchella, commonly known as the white birch, is a deciduous tree native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are triangular in shape, with serrated edges, and turn yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>Betula pulchella thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.</p>
