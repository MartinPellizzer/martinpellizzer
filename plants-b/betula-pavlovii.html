                    <h1>Betula pavlovii</h1>
<p>Betula pavlovii, commonly known as the Pavlov's birch, is a rare and cold-hardy species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping form and silver-white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are oval-shaped with doubly serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>Betula pavlovii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance.</p>
