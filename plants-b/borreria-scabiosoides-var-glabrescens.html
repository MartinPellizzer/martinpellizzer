                    <h1>Borreria scabiosoides var. glabrescens</h1>
<p>Borreria scabiosoides var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth borreria, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Its leaves are usually covered in fine hairs, though the varietal name "glabrescens" suggests a reduction or loss of these hairs compared to the typical form.</p>
<p>This plant is adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
