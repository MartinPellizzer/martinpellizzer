<p>Begonia gesnerioides, commonly known as the rock begonia, is a perennial plant native to southern China and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in dry environments.

It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ease of care, it is widely cultivated in horticulture.</p>
