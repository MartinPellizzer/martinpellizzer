<p>Bulbine concinna, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bulbine, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Xanthorrhoeaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to spread through rhizomes.</p>
