                    <h1>Brownanthus corallinus</h1>
<p>Brownanthus corallinus, commonly known as the coral bush, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its striking coral-pink to reddish-orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in coastal environments.</p>
<p>Brownanthus corallinus thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune systems along the Atlantic coast.</p>
