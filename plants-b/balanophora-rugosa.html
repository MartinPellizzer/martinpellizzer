<p>Balanophora rugosa, commonly known as the rough balanophore, is a rare parasitic plant belonging to the family Balanophoraceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of trees or shrubs. The plant has a highly reduced structure, with a thick, fleshy stem and small, scale-like leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow and are borne in clusters at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Balanophora rugosa is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in humid, shaded environments.</p>
