<p>Betula pubescens subsp.</p>
<p>subarctica, commonly known as the dwarf birch, is a small, shrub-like tree native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and hairy, grayish-brown bark.</p>
<p>The leaves are oval, serrated, and turn yellow in autumn, while the small, cone-like fruits are dispersed by wind. It thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in taiga and tundra environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and plays a role in stabilizing permafrost soils in its native habitat.</p>
