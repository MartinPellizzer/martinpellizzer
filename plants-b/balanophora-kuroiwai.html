<p>Balanophora kuroiwai, commonly known as the Kuroiwa's orchid, is a rare parasitic plant native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant has a short, fleshy stem with small, fleshy leaves that are adapted for parasitic growth. It produces fragrant, yellowish flowers that are typically pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
