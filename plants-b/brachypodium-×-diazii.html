                    <h1>Brachypodium × diazii</h1>
<p>Brachypodium × diazii, commonly known as the hybrid brome, is a sterile grass species resulting from the cross between Brachypodium distachyon and Brachypodium hybridum.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow leaves and compact inflorescences. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is used in ecological studies due to its rapid growth and adaptability. Its genome is of interest in plant genetics research because of its simplicity and genetic tractability.</p>
<p>However, it does not produce viable seeds, limiting its use in agricultural applications.</p>
