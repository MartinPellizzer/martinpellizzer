                    <h1>Baccharis microphylla var. pulverulenta</h1>
<p>Baccharis microphylla var. pulverulenta, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves and stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the fall and winter months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and wildlife habitat in desert landscapes.</p>
