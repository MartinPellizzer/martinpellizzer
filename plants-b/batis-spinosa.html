                    <h1>Batis spinosa</h1>
<p>Batis spinosa, commonly known as the spinous batis, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in coastal or inland areas. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a slightly hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Batis spinosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature.</p>
