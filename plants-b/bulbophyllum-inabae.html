                    <h1>Bulbophyllum inabae</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum inabae, commonly known as the Inaba's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, often with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
