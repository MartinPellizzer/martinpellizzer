<p>Brachypodium glabrum, commonly known as the false brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas, meadows, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is also used in ecological restoration and as a model organism in plant genetics research.</p>
