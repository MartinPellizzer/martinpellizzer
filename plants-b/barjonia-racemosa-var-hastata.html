                    <h1>Barjonia racemosa var. hastata</h1>
<p>Barjonia racemosa var. hastata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved barjonia, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in dense racemes, which bloom during the cooler months. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor, sandy soils.</p>
<p>This species is also noted for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes.</p>
