<p>Begonia acaulis, commonly known as the rock begonia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>

The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually broad and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat.</p>
