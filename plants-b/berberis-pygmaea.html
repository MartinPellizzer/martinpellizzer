                    <h1>Berberis pygmaea</h1>
<p>Berberis pygmaea, commonly known as dwarf barberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, dark green leaves and produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems and compact growth habit, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>Berberis pygmaea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract wildlife.</p>
