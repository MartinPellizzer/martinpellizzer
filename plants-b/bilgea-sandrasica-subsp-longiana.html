<p>Bilgea sandrasica subsp.</p>
<p>longiana, commonly known as the longleaf bilgea, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish in color, which are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
