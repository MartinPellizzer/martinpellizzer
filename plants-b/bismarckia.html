                    <h1>Bismarckia</h1>
<p>Bismarckia, commonly known as the African cycad, is a genus of cycads native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a stout, unbranched trunk that is often covered in a thick, fibrous sheath. The plant has large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. Bismarckia species are dioecious, meaning they have separate male and female plants.</p>
<p>These plants are slow-growing and can live for many decades, making them long-lived and rare in cultivation.</p>
