                    <h1>Bulbophyllum hyposiphon</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum hyposiphon, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and long, slender inflorescences that bear striking, translucent flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found epiphytically on tree trunks or branches. Its flowers, which resemble ghostly shapes, are typically white or pale green with intricate veining.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
