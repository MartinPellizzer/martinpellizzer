                    <h1>Banksia brunnea</h1>
<p>Banksia brunnea, commonly known as the yellow banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flower spikes that appear in late summer to early autumn. The plant produces woody cones that contain seeds, which are released after a fire, aiding in its regeneration. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating, and the plant is adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Banksia brunnea plays an important ecological role, providing nectar for native pollinators and habitat for various wildlife.</p>
