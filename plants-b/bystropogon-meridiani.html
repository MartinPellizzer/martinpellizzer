                    <h1>Bystropogon meridiani</h1>
<p>Bystropogon meridiani, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy seed heads that disperse seeds via the wind. Bystropogon meridiani is adapted to thrive in poor soils and can tolerate high temperatures and low rainfall.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies of desert flora.</p>
