                    <h1>Baccharis incarum var. lejia</h1>
<p>Baccharis incarum var. lejia, commonly known as the Lejia baccharis, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and withstand periods of drought.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and support local wildlife.</p>
