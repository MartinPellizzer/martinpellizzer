<p>Beta vulgaris var. maritima, commonly known as sea beet, is a hardy, salt-tolerant plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features large, fleshy, lobed leaves that are typically red or purple in color, adapted to withstand harsh maritime conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by round, edible roots similar to those of the common beet. It thrives in sandy or saline soils and is often found growing along the edges of beaches and dunes.</p>
<p>Sea beet is also valued for its nutritional content and has been used in traditional cuisines.</p>
