<p>Blechnum macahense, commonly known as the narrow-leaf harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping stems that produce new fronds from the base. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, typically near the tips.</p>
<p>This fern is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks.</p>
