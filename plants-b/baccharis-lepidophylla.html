<p>Baccharis lepidophylla, commonly known as the fairy duster, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, white, feathery inflorescences that resemble miniature dusters, which are particularly striking when in bloom. The plant has fleshy, gray-green leaves that help it conserve water in its dry habitat. It produces small, yellowish flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Baccharis lepidophylla is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, making it a resilient and visually appealing plant in xeriscapes.</p>
