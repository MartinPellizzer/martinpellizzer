                    <h1>Brachyscome scapiformis var. puberula</h1>
<p>Brachyscome scapiformis var. puberula, commonly known as the woolly bluebell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Australia.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, sky-blue flowers surrounded by white bracts, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has hairy, silver-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period, which extends from late spring to autumn.</p>
