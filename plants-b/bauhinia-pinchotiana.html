                    <h1>Bauhinia pinchotiana</h1>
<p>Bauhinia pinchotiana, commonly known as the Florida bauhinia, is a small, deciduous legume native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and showy, butterfly-shaped pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its seeds are encased in a hard, pod-like structure that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind.</p>
<p>Bauhinia pinchotiana plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
