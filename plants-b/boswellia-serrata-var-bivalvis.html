                    <h1>Boswellia serrata var. bivalvis</h1>
<p>Boswellia serrata var. bivalvis, commonly known as Indian frankincense or gugul, is a small evergreen tree native to the arid regions of India, Pakistan, and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, flaky bark and small, leathery leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces a resinous sap, known as frankincense, which is harvested by making incisions in the bark. This resin has been traditionally used in Ayurvedic medicine for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.</p>
<p>The botanical features of B. serrata var. bivalvis make it well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
