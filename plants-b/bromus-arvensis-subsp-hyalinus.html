<p>Bromus arvensis subsp.</p>
<p>hyalinus, commonly known as the silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, silver-green leaves that are often covered with a fine, waxy coating.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and other open areas.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range.</p>
