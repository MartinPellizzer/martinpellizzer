                    <h1>Borzicactus gracilis var. aticensis</h1>
<p>Borzicactus gracilis var. aticensis, commonly known as the Aticeno cactus, is a rare and compact cactus native to the Andean regions of Peru.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, white, woolly spines that provide insulation and protection. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the dry season, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
