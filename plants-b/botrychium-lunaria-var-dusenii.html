                    <h1>Botrychium lunaria var. dusenii</h1>
<p>Botrychium lunaria var. dusenii, commonly known as the silver moonwort, is a rare fern species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, pale green fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorocarps, which are clustered in a rosette at the base of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for ecosystem health.</p>
