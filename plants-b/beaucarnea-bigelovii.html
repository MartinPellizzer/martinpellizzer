                    <h1>Beaucarnea bigelovii</h1>
<p>Beaucarnea bigelovii, commonly known as the ponytail palm, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, tree-like trunk covered in a rough, fibrous bark, which stores water to help it survive in dry conditions. The plant produces a rosette of long, narrow, gray-green leaves that resemble a ponytail, giving it its common name. Its flowering occurs in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Beaucarnea bigelovii is well-suited for low-water landscapes and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
