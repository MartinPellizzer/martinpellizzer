                    <h1>Biophytum myriophyllum</h1>
<p>Biophytum myriophyllum, commonly known as the many-leaved bladderwort, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves that often contain water-filled sacs, a feature adapted for survival in moist or aquatic environments. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, and it belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae. Biophytum myriophyllum is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
