                    <h1>Bulbophyllum sulfureum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum sulfureum, commonly known as the sulfur orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, often yellow or orange-colored flowers that resemble small bulbs, hence its scientific name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforests. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The flowers are usually short-lived but attract various pollinators such as bees and flies.</p>
