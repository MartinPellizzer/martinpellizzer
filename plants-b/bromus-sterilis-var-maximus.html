<p>Bromus sterilis var. maximus, commonly known as the giant false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves, which can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces dense clusters of small, pale green to brownish flowers, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
