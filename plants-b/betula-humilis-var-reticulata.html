                    <h1>Betula humilis var. reticulata</h1>
<p>Betula humilis var. reticulata, commonly known as the reticulate birch, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and distinctive bark that develops a finely reticulated pattern as it matures. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, turning yellow in the autumn. It prefers well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental bark and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.</p>
