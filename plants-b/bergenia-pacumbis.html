<p>Bergenia pacumbis, commonly known as the Pacific bergenia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of pink to red flowers during the spring, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners in temperate climates.</p>
