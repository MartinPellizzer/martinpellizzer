                    <h1>Bontia minor</h1>
<p>Bontia minor, commonly known as the dwarf bottle tree, is a small, deciduous shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, bottle-shaped stems that store water, a feature adapted to its harsh, semi-desert environment. The plant has small, narrow leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Bontia minor is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
