<p>Boechera × rubicundula, commonly known as the redstem rockcress, is a hybrid species within the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in alpine or arctic environments. Its leaves are generally hairy and have a slightly succulent texture, which helps it retain moisture in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Boechera × rubicundula is also notable for its genetic diversity, making it a subject of interest in plant genetics and evolution studies.</p>
