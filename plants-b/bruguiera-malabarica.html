<p>Bruguiera malabarica, commonly known as the mangrove shrub, is a halophytic species native to the coastal regions of India and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, playing a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems. The plant has aerial roots, known as pneumatophores, which help in gas exchange in waterlogged soils. Its leaves are typically small, ovate, and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Bruguiera malabarica is also valued for its ecological importance in preventing soil erosion and providing habitat for marine and terrestrial life.</p>
