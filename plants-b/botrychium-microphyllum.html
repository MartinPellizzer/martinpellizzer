<p>Botrychium microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaf moonwort, is a small fern belonging to the family Onocleaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Botrychium microphyllum is a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range.</p>
