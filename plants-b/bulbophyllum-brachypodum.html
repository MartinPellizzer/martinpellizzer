<p>Bulbophyllum brachypodum, commonly known as the short-stemmed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments within forest understories. The plant produces small, clustered pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in low-light conditions. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, this species is considered threatened in its native range.</p>
