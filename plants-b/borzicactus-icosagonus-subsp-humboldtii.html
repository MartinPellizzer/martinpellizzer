<p>Borzicactus icosagonus subsp.</p>
<p>humboldtii, commonly known as the Humboldt's icosagon cactus, is a rare and unique cactus species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, angular, and ribbed stem that forms a star-like shape, with 20 prominent ribs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its green, spiny structure. It is adapted to survive in harsh desert conditions with minimal water and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment.</p>
