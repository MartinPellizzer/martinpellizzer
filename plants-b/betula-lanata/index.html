                            <h1>Betula Lanata</h1>
<p>Betula lanata, commonly known as the downy birch, is a striking member of the Betulaceae family native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. This tree is easily recognized by its white, peeling bark and dense, fluffy catkins that give it a unique appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. The plant plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Its ornamental value has also made it a popular choice for landscaping in cooler climates.</p>
