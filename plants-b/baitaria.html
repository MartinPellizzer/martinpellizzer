                    <h1>Baitaria</h1>
<p>Baitaria, commonly known as the desert cactus, is a resilient plant native to arid regions.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores.</p>
<p>Baitaria plays an important role in desert ecosystems by providing shelter and food for various animals.</p>
