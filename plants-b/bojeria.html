<p>Bojeria, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for arid environments. Bojeria has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value.</p>
