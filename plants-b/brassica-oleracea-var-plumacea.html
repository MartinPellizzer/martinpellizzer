                    <h1>Brassica oleracea var. plumacea</h1>
<p>Brassica oleracea var. plumacea, commonly known as purple cauliflower, is a cultivar of the cabbage family characterized by its distinctive deep purple or violet florets.</p>
<p>The coloration arises from high concentrations of anthocyanins, which are pigments responsible for the vibrant hues in many fruits and vegetables. It is typically harvested before the florets fully develop, ensuring a tender texture and optimal flavor. This variety is often grown for its ornamental value as well as its nutritional benefits, including antioxidants and dietary fiber.</p>
<p>While it shares the genetic makeup of other Brassica species, its unique coloration sets it apart in both appearance and culinary use.</p>
