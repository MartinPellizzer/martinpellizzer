                    <h1>Beccabunga vulgaris</h1>
<p>Beccabunga vulgaris, commonly known as the water clover, is a aquatic plant characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small, oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it can anchor itself to the substrate. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom above the water surface, contributing to its ornamental value. Beccabunga vulgaris is often used in aquatic gardens and pond ecosystems for its ability to oxygenate water and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure supports both its ecological role and its aesthetic appeal in water-based landscapes.</p>
