<p>It is characterized by its distinctive morphology, featuring a fleshy, club-shaped rhizome and a pair of fiddlehead-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in a unique, umbrella-like formation on the underside of the fronds.</p>
