<p>Bassia perakensis, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in desert and semi-desert environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically small and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in harsh climates.</p>
<p>Bassia perakensis is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
