                    <h1>Bolbitis sinensis var. costulata</h1>
<p>Bolbitis sinensis var. costulata, commonly known as the Costate Bolbitis, is a rare and distinctive fern native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, deeply lobed fronds that exhibit a striking contrast between the dark green upper surface and the lighter green underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself in rocky or soil substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
