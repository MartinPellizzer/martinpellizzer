<p>Blandina biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, which it then digests for nutrients. This plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor waters such as ponds and wetlands. Its flowers are small and usually pink or white, with a distinctive bilaterally symmetrical shape.</p>
<p>Blandina biflora is a carnivorous plant that plays a unique role in aquatic ecosystems by supplementing its nutrient intake through predation.</p>
