<p>Betula schmidtii var. lancea, commonly known as the narrowleaf birch, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>

The bark of this species is smooth and often exhibits a white or pale gray color, which becomes fissured with age. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
