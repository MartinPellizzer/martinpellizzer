<p>Bulbophyllum ecristatum, commonly known as the ridged orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ridged pseudobulbs and long, arching inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage consists of narrow, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle.</p>
<p>Bulbophyllum ecristatum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
