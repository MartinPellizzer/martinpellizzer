<p>Bryonia stipulacea, commonly known as the Jerusalem artichoke, is a perennial plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, followed by edible tubers that are rich in inulin. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a hardy addition to gardens.</p>
<p>Despite its name, it is not related to the artichoke but is often cultivated for its nutritious and versatile tubers.</p>
