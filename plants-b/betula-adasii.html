                    <h1>Betula adasii</h1>
<p>Betula adasii, commonly known as the Himalayan birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central and South Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and turn yellow in the fall, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Betula adasii thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found at high altitudes in forested areas.</p>
