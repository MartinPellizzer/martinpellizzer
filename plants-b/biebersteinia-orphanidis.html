<p>Biebersteinia orphanidis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, elongated stem and small, delicate flowers that often resemble the shape of a ghostly face. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and they emit a faint, sweet fragrance.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Biebersteinia orphanidis is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
