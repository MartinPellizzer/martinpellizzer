<p>Bouzetia maritima, commonly known as the sea daisies, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is often found in sandy or rocky coastal habitats. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are linear and covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in salty, windy environments.</p>
<p>Bouzetia maritima is adapted to tolerate salt spray and is an important component of coastal vegetation.</p>
