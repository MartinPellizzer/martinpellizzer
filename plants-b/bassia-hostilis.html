                    <h1>Bassia hostilis</h1>
<p>Bassia hostilis, commonly known as Russian thistle, is an annual plant native to Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prickly, spiny stems and leaves, which help it survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by fluffy seeds that are easily dispersed by the wind. It is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is adapted to thrive in disturbed soils and dry climates.</p>
