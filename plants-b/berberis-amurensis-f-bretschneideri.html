                    <h1>Berberis amurensis f. bretschneideri</h1>
<p>Berberis amurensis f. bretschneideri, commonly known as the Amur barberry, is a shrub native to eastern Asia, particularly China and Russia.</p>
<p>It features upright, spiny stems and dark green, oval-shaped leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible but tart. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and winter interest.</p>
<p>The variety is distinguished by its more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Berberis amurensis.</p>
