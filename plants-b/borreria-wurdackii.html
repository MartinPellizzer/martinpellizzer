                    <h1>Borreria wurdackii</h1>
<p>Borreria wurdackii, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its hot, dry environment. Borreria wurdackii is well adapted to poor soil conditions and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy plant for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant color and drought tolerance, making it a popular choice for desert gardens.</p>
