<p>Betula cylindrostachya var. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth-barked birch, is a variant of the cylindrostachya birch species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark that lacks the typical flaky texture found in other birch species. The leaves are elliptic to ovate, with a doubly serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, pendulous catkins and is typically found in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in forest ecosystems.</p>
