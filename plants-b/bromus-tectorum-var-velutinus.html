                    <h1>Bromus tectorum var. velutinus</h1>
<p>Bromus tectorum var. velutinus, commonly known as the velvet brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that give it a distinctive velvety texture. This plant thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland ecosystems. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife, though it can become invasive in certain environments.</p>
<p>Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to spread across open landscapes.</p>
