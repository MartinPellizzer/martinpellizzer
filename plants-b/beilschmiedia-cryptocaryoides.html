<p>Beilschmiedia cryptocaryoides, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and fleshy, red berries. The plant attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as rimu and kahikatea, using specialized root-like structures called haustoria. It is typically found in temperate rainforests, where it thrives in the humid, shaded environment.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
