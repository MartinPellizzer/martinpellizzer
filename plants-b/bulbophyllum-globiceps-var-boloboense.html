<p>Bulbophyllum globiceps var. boloboense, commonly known as the Boloboense Pterostylis, is a rare orchid species native to the rainforests of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulb-like structure and produces striking, showy flowers with a distinctive greenish-yellow coloration. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its flowers are highly fragrant, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
