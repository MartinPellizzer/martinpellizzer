<p>Bromus arcticus subsp.</p>
<p>ornans, commonly known as the Arctic brome, is a perennial grass native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically grows in open, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in extreme conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is an important component of tundra and mountain ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing forage for herbivores.</p>
