                    <h1>Bromus commutatus f. perglaber</h1>
<p>Bromus commutatus f. perglaber, commonly known as the slender brome, is a grass species characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields, roadsides, and meadows, preferring well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous short, awned florets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. Its flowering period usually occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can sometimes become invasive in non-native environments.</p>
