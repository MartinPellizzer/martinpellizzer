<p>Bulbostylis wombaliensis, commonly known as the Wombali sedge, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and rhizomatous growth habit.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its bulbs, which are its primary vegetative structures, allow it to propagate and survive in fluctuating water levels.</p>
<p>This species is native to Australia and is often found in the northern regions of Queensland.</p>
