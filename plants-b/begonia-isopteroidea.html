<p>Begonia isopteroidea, commonly known as the silver-leaf begonia, is a species native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, velvety silver-green foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings.</p>
