                    <h1>Biscutella hispida</h1>
<p>Biscutella hispida, commonly known as the hispid biscuitroot, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact rosette of hairy, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its succulent stems and leaves store water, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Biscutella hispida is often found in rocky soils and is considered a characteristic species of steppe and shrubland habitats.</p>
