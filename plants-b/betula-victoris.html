                    <h1>Betula victoris</h1>
<p>Betula victoris, commonly known as the mountain birch, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its white or yellowish bark, which peels in thin, papery layers. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Betula victoris thrives in cold, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges, and they turn yellow or red in the fall.</p>
