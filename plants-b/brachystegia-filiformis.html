                    <h1>Brachystegia filiformis</h1>
<p>Brachystegia filiformis, commonly known as the slender brachystegia, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils and plays a role in the ecological structure of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
