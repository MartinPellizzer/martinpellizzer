<p>Betula utilis subsp.</p>
<p>albosinensis, commonly known as the Himalayan birch, is a deciduous tree native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals layers of pale green and yellow beneath, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates.</p>
