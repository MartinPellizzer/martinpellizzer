                    <h1>Bassia pulverulenta</h1>
<p>Bassia pulverulenta, commonly known as sandburs, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, spiny fruits that are adapted for wind dispersal. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Bassia pulverulenta is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
