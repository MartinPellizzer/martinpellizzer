<p>Brachiaria semiundulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf blady grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and distinctive, finger-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, including marshes and swamps, where it thrives in saturated soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, often competing with other vegetation.</p>
<p>Brachiaria semiundulata is also known for its ability to tolerate flooding, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
