                    <h1>Byttneria subsessilis</h1>
<p>Byttneria subsessilis, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its smooth, often glabrous bark and alternate, elliptic to ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It is typically found in moist, lowland forests and is valued for its hard, heavy wood used in furniture and construction.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
