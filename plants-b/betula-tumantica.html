                    <h1>Betula tumantica</h1>
<p>Betula tumantica, commonly known as the white birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold climates of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and turn yellow in the fall before falling off.</p>
<p>Betula tumantica is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance.</p>
