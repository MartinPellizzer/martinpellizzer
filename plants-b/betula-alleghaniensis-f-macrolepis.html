                    <h1>Betula alleghaniensis f. macrolepis</h1>
<p>Betula alleghaniensis f. macrolepis, commonly known as the Allegheny hardwood birch, is a rare and distinctive variant of the yellow birch.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its larger, more elongated leaves compared to the typical yellow birch, which gives it a unique appearance. The plant is native to the eastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian region, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its bark is smooth and pale, often with a slight reddish tint, and it produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring.</p>
<p>This form is of interest to botanists due to its genetic and morphological differences from the standard yellow birch.</p>
