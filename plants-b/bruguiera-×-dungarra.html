                    <h1>Bruguiera × dungarra</h1>
<p>Bruguiera × dungarra, commonly known as the Dungarra mangrove, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Bruguiera gymnorhiza and Bruguiera sexangula.</p>
<p>It is a halophytic tree found in tropical and subtropical coastal regions, particularly in mangrove ecosystems. The plant exhibits pneumatophores, which are specialized root structures that aid in gas exchange in waterlogged soils. Its leaves are typically small, alternate, and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The Dungarra mangrove plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal sediments and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
