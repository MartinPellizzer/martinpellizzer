                    <h1>Bignonia nitidula</h1>
<p>Bignonia nitidula, commonly known as the silverleaf bignonia, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming in the spring. Its stems are woody and can grow quite long, allowing it to climb trees or structures.</p>
<p>The seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind.</p>
