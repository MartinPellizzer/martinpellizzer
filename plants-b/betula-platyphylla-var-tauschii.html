                    <h1>Betula platyphylla var. tauschii</h1>
<p>Betula platyphylla var. tauschii, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a deciduous tree native to the colder regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Its leaves are triangular in shape, with serrated edges, and turn yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to harsh climates.</p>
