<p>Bryobium atrorubens, commonly known as the red-stemmed moss, is a rare and specialized liverwort species.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its dark reddish stems and small, clustered leaves. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or on rocky substrates. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short stalks and release spores when mature.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
