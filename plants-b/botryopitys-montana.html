<p>Botryopitys montana, commonly known as the mountain fir, is a coniferous tree native to the high altitudes of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and needle-like leaves that are arranged spirally along its branches. The tree produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing seeds enclosed in woody scales. Its root system is typically shallow but can extend deep into rocky soils to access moisture.</p>
<p>Botryopitys montana plays an important role in mountain ecosystems, providing habitat and contributing to soil stability in alpine environments.</p>
