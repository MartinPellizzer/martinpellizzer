                    <h1>Breynia rigida var. puberula</h1>
<p>Breynia rigida var. puberula, commonly known as the hairy breynia, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like structures, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the rainy season, followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods. Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it a resilient plant in xerophytic ecosystems.</p>
<p>The leaves and stems are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
