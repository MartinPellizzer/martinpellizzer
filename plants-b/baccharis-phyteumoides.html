<p>Baccharis phyteumoides, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its aromatic leaves that emit a distinctive scent when crushed. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
