<p>Betula pubescens subsp.</p>
<p>concinna, commonly known as the silver birch, is a deciduous tree native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a silvery inner layer, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant has small, triangular leaves that are usually doubly serrated and turn yellow in autumn. It produces small, yellowish catkins that are wind-pollinated, and its seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is relatively cold-hardy, making it a common tree in boreal and temperate forests.</p>
