                    <h1>Banksia urvilleana</h1>
<p>Banksia urvilleana, commonly known as the Narrow-leaf Banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, yellow to orange flower spikes that appear in late summer to early autumn. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are released after a fire, aiding in its regeneration. Its leaves are narrow and often have a silvery underside, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Banksia urvilleana is well adapted to the dry, nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat.</p>
