                    <h1>Brasolia sobralioides</h1>
<p>Brasolia sobralioides, commonly known as the Sobral's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as *Myrtaceae* species, through its specialized haustoria to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its leaves are thick and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its often-dry habitat.</p>
<p>Brasolia sobralioides plays a unique ecological role in its ecosystem, contributing to both plant and animal biodiversity.</p>
