                    <h1>Botrychium parvifolium var. parvum</h1>
<p>Botrychium parvifolium var. parvum, commonly known as the small-leaf moonwort, is a fern that belongs to the family Osmundaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia in clusters called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its reduced leaf size and simplified morphology compared to other members of the genus.</p>
