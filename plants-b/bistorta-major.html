                    <h1>Bistorta major</h1>
<p>Bistorta major, commonly known as great bistort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features tall, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, covered with lance-shaped leaves that are often reddish at the base. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish to purple flowers in late summer, which are arranged in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Bistorta major is often found in woodlands, stream banks, and damp meadows, where it thrives in partially shaded conditions.</p>
