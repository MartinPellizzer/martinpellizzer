<p>Bistorta ophioglossa, commonly known as the narrowleaf bistorta, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Ophioglossaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped leaves that are often dark green with a metallic sheen. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a unique, umbrella-like arrangement. It typically grows in shaded, moist woodland environments, preferring well-drained, acidic soils.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
