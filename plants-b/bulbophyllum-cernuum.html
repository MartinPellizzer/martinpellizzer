                    <h1>Bulbophyllum cernuum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum cernuum, commonly known as the hanging orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features elongated, pendulous pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often clustered at the tips of the stems. Its roots are adapted to cling to tree bark, allowing it to thrive in canopy layers of rainforests.</p>
<p>Bulbophyllum cernuum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or terrariums.</p>
