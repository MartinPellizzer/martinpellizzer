                    <h1>Bassia lanuginosa</h1>
<p>Bassia lanuginosa, commonly known as wooly bassia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a woolly appearance, helping to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots enable it to thrive in poor, sandy soils and withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Bassia lanuginosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
