                    <h1>Betula obscura</h1>
<p>Betula obscura, commonly known as the dark birch, is a deciduous tree native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark that becomes fissured with age, and its small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces catkin-like flowers and small, winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Betula obscura thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in boreal forests and wetlands.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
