                    <h1>Bulbophyllum pantoblepharon var. pantoblepharon</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum pantoblepharon var. pantoblepharon, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green, leaf-like pseudobulbs and elongated, narrow leaves that help it conserve moisture in its humid habitat. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling ghostly shapes, hence its common name. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires specific conditions to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as critically endangered in some regions.</p>
