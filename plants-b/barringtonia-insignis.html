                    <h1>Barringtonia insignis</h1>
<p>Barringtonia insignis, commonly known as the white cedar or mountain cedar, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, pendulous white flowers that bloom at night. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release numerous small, hairy seeds. The plant is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests, where it thrives in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Its unique floral structure and nocturnal blooming habit make it an important species for pollinators like moths.</p>
