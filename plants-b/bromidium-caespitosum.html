                    <h1>Bromidium caespitosum</h1>
<p>Bromidium caespitosum, commonly known as the desert holly, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features compact, rosette-shaped growth with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding survival in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the rainy season, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise rugged appearance. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss through evaporation.</p>
<p>Bromidium caespitosum is well-suited for xeriscaping and requires minimal care once established.</p>
