<p>Brunsvigia gydobergensis, commonly known as the Knysna cycad, is a unique cycad species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, trunk-like stem and large, pinnate leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces striking yellow to orange cones, which are a key feature in its reproductive cycle. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered plant.</p>
