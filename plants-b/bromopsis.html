<p>Bromopsis, commonly known as the rock grass or rock sedge, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species that are typically found in rocky or alpine environments, often growing in crevices or on slopes. These plants are characterized by their grass-like appearance, with narrow leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. Bromopsis species are generally hardy and adapted to harsh climates, making them resilient to cold and poor soil conditions.</p>
