                    <h1>Bougainvillea spectabilis var. hirsutissima</h1>
<p>Bougainvillea spectabilis var. hirsutissima, commonly known as the hairy bougainvillea, is a flowering plant native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, papery bracts that come in shades of pink, red, and purple, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant has a woody stem with thorn-like protrusions and produces small, inconspicuous white flowers inside the bracts. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its foliage consists of small, pointed leaves that are typically green and glossy.</p>
