                    <h1>Bihai collinsiana</h1>
<p>Bihai collinsiana, commonly known as the Collins' cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the island of Bihai in the Solomon Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones instead of flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native region.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and evolutionary history make it an important subject for botanical research.</p>
