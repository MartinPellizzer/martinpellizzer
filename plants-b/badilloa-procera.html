                    <h1>Badilloa procera</h1>
<p>Badilloa procera, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with thick, fleshy stems and broad, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fluffy, parachute-like seeds for wind dispersal. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Badilloa procera is well adapted to desert climates and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
