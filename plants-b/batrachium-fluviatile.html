                    <h1>Batrachium fluviatile</h1>
<p>Batrachium fluviatile, commonly known as the river frog orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific wetland habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has a slender, creeping rhizome and produces oval, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. It thrives in nutrient-rich, slow-moving water bodies and is often found in marshes and along the edges of rivers.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
