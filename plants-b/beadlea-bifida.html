                    <h1>Beadlea bifida</h1>
<p>Beadlea bifida, commonly known as the split-leaved beadlea, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive bifid (split) leaves, which are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Beadlea bifida thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
