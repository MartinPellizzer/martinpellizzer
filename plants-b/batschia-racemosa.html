                    <h1>Batschia racemosa</h1>
<p>Batschia racemosa, commonly known as the clustered broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions of the western United States. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, and it is often found growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its botanical structure is adapted for parasitism, with specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system.</p>
<p>Due to its lack of leaves and photosynthetic ability, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem as a specialist parasite.</p>
