<p>Botrychium palmatum subsp.</p>
<p>angustisegmentum, commonly known as the narrow-segmented moonwort, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped sporangia. It is a small, terrestrial fern typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant has a simple, rhizomatous growth habit with a single, erect, leaf-like structure called a frond. Its sporangia are clustered in a single, prominent group at the base of the frond, a feature typical of the Botrychium genus.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its narrow, elongated segments that give it its specific epithet.</p>
