<p>Brachycorythis tenuior, commonly known as the slender-leafed cycad, is a species of cycad native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, strap-like leaves that grow in a dense, fan-like arrangement. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a warm, sunny climate.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes.</p>
