                    <h1>Berberis lycioides</h1>
<p>Berberis lycioides, commonly known as the desert barberry, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thorny stems, small evergreen leaves, and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible for wildlife but generally unpalatable to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Berberis lycioides plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for desert animals.</p>
