                    <h1>Bupleurum divaricatum var. aristatum</h1>
<p>Bupleurum divaricatum var. aristatum, commonly known as the silverleaf bupleurum, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, branching stems that are often covered in a dense layer of silvery-white hairs, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbel-like clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective properties.</p>
