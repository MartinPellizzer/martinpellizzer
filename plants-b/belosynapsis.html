<p>Belosynapsis, commonly known as the false broomweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, yellowish or brownish flowers arranged in composite heads. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture. Belosynapsis species are often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>These plants are sometimes considered invasive in certain regions due to their rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas.</p>
