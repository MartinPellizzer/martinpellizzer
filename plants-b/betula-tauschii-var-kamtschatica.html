                    <h1>Betula tauschii var. kamtschatica</h1>
<p>Betula tauschii var. kamtschatica, commonly known as the Kamchatka birch, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern Russian region of Kamchatka.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray bark that exfoliates to reveal a pale inner layer. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a doubly serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous and coastal areas.</p>
