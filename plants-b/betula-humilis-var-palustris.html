                    <h1>Betula humilis var. palustris</h1>
<p>Betula humilis var. palustris, commonly known as the swamp birch, is a low-growing shrub native to the wetlands of northern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in autumn. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are an important food source for pollinators.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs and swampy areas.</p>
