                    <h1>Botrychium lunaria var. cordatum</h1>
<p>Botrychium lunaria var. cordatum, commonly known as the heart-shaped moonwort, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped sporophylls that are usually green and slightly curled. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to other members of the Botrychium genus, which are known for their unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
