                    <h1>Brachiaria nodosa</h1>
<p>Brachiaria nodosa, commonly known as hairy signalgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which helps stabilize soil. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>Brachiaria nodosa is often found in grasslands and disturbed sites, where it plays a role in ecological succession.</p>
