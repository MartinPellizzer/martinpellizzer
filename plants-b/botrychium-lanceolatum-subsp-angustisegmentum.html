<p>Botrychium lanceolatum subsp.</p>
<p>angustisegmentum, commonly known as the narrow-segmented moonwort, is a small fern belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often curved fronds that are divided into segments.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in a central umbel on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is relatively rare and is often found in specific geographic regions with particular soil and moisture conditions.</p>
