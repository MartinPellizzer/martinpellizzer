<p>Betula procurva subsp.</p>
<p>lipskyi, commonly known as the Lipsky's weeping birch, is a rare and unique subspecies native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its pendulous branches that droop gracefully, giving it a distinctive weeping appearance.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by triangular, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are typically oval with a serrated margin and turn yellow in the autumn.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to harsh alpine environments, thriving in cold, dry conditions with well-drained soils.</p>
