<p>Botrychium ramosum var. patagonicum, commonly known as the Patagonian moonwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Onocleaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces sporangia in clusters called sorangia, which are arranged in a distinctive, often branching pattern. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions of South America.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
