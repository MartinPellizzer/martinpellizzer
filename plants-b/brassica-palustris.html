                    <h1>Brassica palustris</h1>
<p>Brassica palustris, commonly known as swamp cabbage, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland areas of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist or waterlogged soils, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly ovate with a waxy surface, and it produces small, yellow, cruciform flowers in early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in siliques, a characteristic feature of the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>Brassica palustris is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize wetland soils and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>
