The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the dense canopy of the tropical rainforest. Its foliage is glossy and dark green, with leaves that are often clustered at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
