<p>Bourreria spinifex, commonly known as the spiny burrgrass, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, bract-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access water from underground sources. Its seeds are dispersed by animals that feed on the fleshy, spiky fruits.</p>
<p>Bourreria spinifex plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small wildlife.</p>
