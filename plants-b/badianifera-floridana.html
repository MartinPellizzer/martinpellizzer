                    <h1>Badianifera floridana</h1>
<p>Badianifera floridana, commonly known as Florida starwood, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the wetlands of Florida.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal hammocks and pine flatwoods. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, the survival of this species is increasingly threatened.</p>
