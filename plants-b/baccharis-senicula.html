                    <h1>Baccharis senicula</h1>
<p>Baccharis senicula, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Its small, white flowers are clustered in dense, spherical heads and bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>Baccharis senicula is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
