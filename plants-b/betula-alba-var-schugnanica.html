                    <h1>Betula alba var. schugnanica</h1>
<p>Betula alba var. schugnanica, commonly known as the Schugnanica birch, is a rare and unique variant of the white birch.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking white bark that remains throughout its life, unlike the typical white birch which often develops a darker bark with age. The plant is native to the Caucasus region, specifically found in areas of Georgia and Armenia. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
