<p>Bubonium aquaticum subsp.</p>
<p>nanus, commonly known as the dwarf water bellflower, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in temperate regions. It typically grows in shallow waters, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it can anchor itself in muddy or sandy substrates.</p>
<p>The plant has slender, branching stems and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually blue or purple in color. Its leaves are narrow and ribbon-like, adapted for efficient water absorption.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its compact size and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic biodiversity.</p>
