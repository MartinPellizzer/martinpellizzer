                    <h1>Bellium droserifolium</h1>
<p>Bellium droserifolium, commonly known as the droserifolium bellium, is a rare and unique carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, adding to its ornamental appeal. Its habitat is highly specific, requiring consistently moist and nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specialized needs, it is often cultivated in controlled environments by enthusiasts and botanists.</p>
