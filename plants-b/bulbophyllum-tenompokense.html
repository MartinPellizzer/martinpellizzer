                    <h1>Bulbophyllum tenompokense</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum tenompokense, commonly known as the Borneo ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is a lithophytic plant, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, often in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with intricate patterns that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. Its inflorescence typically consists of several pale yellow or white flowers that bloom during the wet season.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
