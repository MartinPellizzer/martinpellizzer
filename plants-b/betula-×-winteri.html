                    <h1>Betula × winteri</h1>
<p>Betula × winteri, commonly known as the hybrid birch, is a deciduous tree that exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, Betula pendula and Betula jacquemontii.</p>
<p>It is notable for its smooth, white bark that peels in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, followed by oval, greenish leaves that turn golden in autumn. Betula × winteri thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its adaptability and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
