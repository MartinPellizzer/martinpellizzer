                    <h1>Bryodesma humifusum</h1>
<p>Bryodesma humifusum, commonly known as the mossy lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its greenish to yellowish thallus, which is often covered in a dense layer of moss-like structures. The plant forms symbiotic relationships with algae, which provide essential nutrients through photosynthesis. It is typically found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for ecological health.</p>
