                    <h1>Benstonea serpentinica</h1>
<p>Benstonea serpentinica, commonly known as the serpentine stonecrop, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, magnesium-rich soils found in serpentine rock formations.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species in many regions.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations make it an important subject for ecological and botanical research.</p>
