                    <h1>Berberis macrosepala var. setifolia</h1>
<p>Berberis macrosepala var. setifolia, commonly known as the woolly barberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, woolly pubescence. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but generally not consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens.</p>
