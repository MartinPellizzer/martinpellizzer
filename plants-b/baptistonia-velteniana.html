<p>Baptistonia velteniana, commonly known as the Velten's bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap tiny aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are thin and often submerged, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing above the water surface.</p>
<p>Baptistonia velteniana plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
