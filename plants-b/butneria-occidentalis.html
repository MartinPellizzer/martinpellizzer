                    <h1>Butneria occidentalis</h1>
<p>Butneria occidentalis, commonly known as the western butneria, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its hot, dry environment. It is often found growing in rocky soils and along dry streambeds.</p>
<p>Butneria occidentalis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small insects.</p>
