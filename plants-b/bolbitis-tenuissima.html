                    <h1>Bolbitis tenuissima</h1>
<p>Bolbitis tenuissima, commonly known as the slender fern, is a delicate, low-growing fern native to the wetlands and marshes of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features a slender, creeping rhizome with small, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The fronds are pinnately divided, with finely toothed margins and a pale green coloration. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in association with other wetland plants.</p>
<p>Due to its fragile nature, it is seldom seen in the wild outside of its specific habitat.</p>
