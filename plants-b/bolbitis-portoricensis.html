                    <h1>Bolbitis portoricensis</h1>
<p>Bolbitis portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican water fern, is a rare aquatic fern native to the island of Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as streams and pools, where it attaches to submerged rocks or vegetation. Its fronds are pinnate, with small, spore-producing structures called sori located on the underside.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and pollution, Bolbitis portoricensis is considered endangered and is of significant ecological importance to the region's aquatic ecosystems.</p>
