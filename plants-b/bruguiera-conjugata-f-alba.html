<p>Bruguiera conjugata f. alba, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its white, fleshy pneumatophores that aid in gas exchange in waterlogged soils. The plant has small, opposite leaves with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces small, yellow flowers that are typically borne in clusters.</p>
<p>This species plays a crucial role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
