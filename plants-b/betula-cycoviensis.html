<p>Betula cycoviensis, commonly known as the Cycoviens birch, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and smooth, grayish bark that exfoliates in thin, papery layers. The leaves are oval to lanceolate, with serrated margins and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are essential for its pollination process.</p>
<p>This species thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in subalpine forests.</p>
