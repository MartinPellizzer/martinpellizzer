                    <h1>Boopis dubia</h1>
<p>Boopis dubia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant has slender, strap-like leaves and produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive, making it a challenging species to cultivate.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Boopis dubia is considered critically endangered in its native range.</p>
