                    <h1>Beta vulgaris var. atra</h1>
<p>Beta vulgaris var. atra, commonly known as black sugar beet, is a variety of the sugar beet plant characterized by its dark purple to black leaves.</p>
<p>It is primarily cultivated for its high sugar content in its taproot, similar to other sugar beet varieties. The plant is a biennial, though it is typically grown as an annual in agricultural settings. Its leaves are edible and have a slightly sweet, earthy flavor.</p>
<p>The dark pigmentation of the leaves is due to the presence of anthocyanins, which also contribute to its nutritional value.</p>
