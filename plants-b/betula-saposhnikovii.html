                    <h1>Betula saposhnikovii</h1>
<p>Betula saposhnikovii, commonly known as the Korean birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are elliptic to ovate, with doubly serrated margins and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are followed by winged seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
