                    <h1>Baccharis thomasii</h1>
<p>Baccharis thomasii, commonly known as Thomas's baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open areas such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has aromatic, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>The fruit is a small, dry capsule that disperses seeds by wind, aiding in its spread across arid regions.</p>
