                    <h1>Blitum salsum</h1>
<p>Blitum salsum, commonly known as saltbush, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Blitum salsum is well adapted to saline soils and is often found in salt marshes and coastal dunes.</p>
