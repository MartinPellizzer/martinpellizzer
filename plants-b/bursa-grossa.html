                    <h1>Bursa grossa</h1>
<p>Bursa grossa, commonly known as the large burr plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its unique feature is the development of large, woody burrs that enclose the seeds, aiding in wind and animal dispersal.</p>
<p>Bursa grossa is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
