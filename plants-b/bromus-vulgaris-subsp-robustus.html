<p>Bromus vulgaris subsp.</p>
<p>robustus, commonly known as the rough brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and is often found in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>The plant has rough, stiff leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Its seeds are small and wind-dispersed, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings but can also play a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
