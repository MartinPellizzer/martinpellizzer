<p>Bulbophyllum bidenticulatum subsp.</p>
<p>joyceae, commonly known as Joyce's bulbophyllum, is a rare orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a spike, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
