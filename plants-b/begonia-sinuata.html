                    <h1>Begonia sinuata</h1>
<p>Begonia sinuata, commonly known as the wavy-leaved begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive wavy margin. The plant produces clusters of small, delicate flowers in shades of pink or red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Begonia sinuata prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its modest floral display.</p>
