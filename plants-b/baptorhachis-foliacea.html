<p>Baptorhachis foliacea, commonly known as the leafy spurge, is a flowering plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, upright inflorescences. It is an invasive species that can outcompete native vegetation in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and spread, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions.</p>
