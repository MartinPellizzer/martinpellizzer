<p>Blaeria patula, commonly known as the narrowleaf bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. Blaeria patula is a carnivorous plant that supplements its nutrient intake by digesting trapped prey.</p>
<p>Its flowers are small and usually pink or white, arranged in clusters at the base of the plant.</p>
