                    <h1>Borzicactus morleyanus</h1>
<p>Borzicactus morleyanus, commonly known as the Morley's barrel cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its spines are short and dense, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Borzicactus morleyanus is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
