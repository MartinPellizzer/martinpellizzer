                    <h1>Betula verrucosa</h1>
<p>Betula verrucosa, commonly known as the European birch, is a deciduous tree native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in papery layers, and its small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces catkin-like flowers and small, winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Betula verrucosa is valued for its timber and its role in supporting biodiversity in its native habitats.</p>
