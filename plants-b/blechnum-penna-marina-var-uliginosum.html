                    <h1>Blechnum penna-marina var. uliginosum</h1>
<p>Blechnum penna-marina var. uliginosum, commonly known as the bog holly fern, is a variant of the common holly fern native to wetland environments in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, moss-like growth, which helps it anchor in waterlogged conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
