<p>Banksia integrifolia var. minor, commonly known as the coastal banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, especially on the underside. The plant produces striking yellow flower spikes that appear in spring, attracting a variety of pollinators such as birds and insects. Its woody fruiting structures, called follicles, contain seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in heathland and coastal scrub environments.</p>
