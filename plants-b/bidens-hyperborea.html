                    <h1>Bidens hyperborea</h1>
<p>Bidens hyperborea, commonly known as the alpine ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, which are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with distinctive ray florets, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant.</p>
