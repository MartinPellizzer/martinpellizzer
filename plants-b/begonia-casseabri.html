                    <h1>Begonia casseabri</h1>
<p>Begonia casseabri, commonly known as the rock begonia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color, blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated by gardeners in regions with a Mediterranean climate.</p>
