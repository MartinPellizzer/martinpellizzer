<p>Bistorta pacifica var. tomentella, commonly known as the Pacific bistort, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and rosettes of lance-shaped, often reddish leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish to purple flowers in late summer, which are borne on slender, branching stalks. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as streambanks and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Its fibrous roots and rhizomes contribute to its hardiness and ability to colonize moist soils.</p>
