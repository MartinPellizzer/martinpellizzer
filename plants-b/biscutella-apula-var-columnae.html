                    <h1>Biscutella apula var. columnae</h1>
<p>Biscutella apula var. columnae, commonly known as the columnar biscutella, is a rare and unique variant of the biscutella genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, columnar growth habit, which distinguishes it from the more spreading form of the species. The plant typically features small, lance-shaped leaves and produces delicate, yellowish flowers in early spring. It is native to specific regions in the Mediterranean, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and distinctive morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
