<p>Bulbophyllum quadrisetum, commonly known as the four-ribbed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant flowers.

Its leaves are usually dark green and strap-like, often with a waxy texture.</p>
<p>This orchid thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
