                    <h1>Bulbophyllum quadricolor</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum quadricolor, commonly known as the four-colored orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, colorful flowers that typically display a combination of red, yellow, and green hues. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in humid, tropical environments.</p>
<p>The flowers bloom in clusters and are often used in horticultural displays due to their vibrant appearance.</p>
