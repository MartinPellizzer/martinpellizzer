                    <h1>Binghamia melanostele</h1>
<p>Binghamia melanostele, commonly known as the black-stemmed billygoat pea, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, woody stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has adapted to harsh, dry environments with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater. Its leaves are small and hairy, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Binghamia melanostele plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for native pollinators.</p>
