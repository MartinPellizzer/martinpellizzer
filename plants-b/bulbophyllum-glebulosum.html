                    <h1>Bulbophyllum glebulosum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum glebulosum, commonly known as the globose bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, bulb-like pseudobulbs and is often grown as a miniature orchid due to its small size. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Bulbophyllum glebulosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in a home setting.</p>
