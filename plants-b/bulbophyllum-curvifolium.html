                    <h1>Bulbophyllum curvifolium</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum curvifolium, commonly known as the curl-leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, curling leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in tropical rainforests. Its roots form a dense network to anchor it to tree trunks and absorb moisture from the air.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
