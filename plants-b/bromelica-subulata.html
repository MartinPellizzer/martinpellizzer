<p>Bromelica subulata, commonly known as the silver pineapple, is a striking plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence adorned with vibrant orange bracts. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a silvery, waxy coating, giving it its common name. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
<p>Bromelica subulata is also noted for its ability to produce edible fruits, though they are not as commonly consumed as those of the more familiar pineapple species.</p>
