                    <h1>Betula luminifera var. baeumkeri</h1>
<p>Betula luminifera var. baeumkeri, commonly known as the Moonlight Birch, is a rare and striking variant of the luminifera birch species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its exceptionally white, almost glowing bark that reflects light, giving it a spectral appearance. The tree has slender, upright branches and produces small, inconspicuous catkins in the spring. Its leaves are oval-shaped, with a smooth margin and a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>This variant is highly valued in botanical gardens for its unique visual appeal and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
