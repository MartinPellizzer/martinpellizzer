                    <h1>Bromus unioloides var. brevis</h1>
<p>Bromus unioloides var. brevis, commonly known as the short-stemmed brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas. The plant has slender,丛生 stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a single, dense spikelet at the tip of each stem, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>This variety is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small organisms.</p>
