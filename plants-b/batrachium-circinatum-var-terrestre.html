                    <h1>Batrachium circinatum var. terrestre</h1>
<p>Batrachium circinatum var. terrestre, commonly known as the terrestrial bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and marsh environments.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, which it then digests for nutrients. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, with slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pink and are borne on erect, slender spikes.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its unique adaptation to nutrient-poor environments through its carnivorous behavior.</p>
