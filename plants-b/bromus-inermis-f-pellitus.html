<p>Bromus inermis f. pellitus, commonly known as the slender brome, is a perennial grass species native to western North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and rocky areas. The plant has slender,丛生 stems that are usually less than 30 cm in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each stem, which is often obscured by the foliage.</p>
