                    <h1>Bermudiana pusilla</h1>
<p>Bermudiana pusilla, commonly known as the small Bermuda grass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to the subtropical regions of the Caribbean and parts of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, light green blades and a dense, mat-forming growth habit that helps it thrive in well-drained soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated, and it has a fibrous root system that aids in soil stabilization. Bermudiana pusilla is often used in lawns and erosion control due to its durability and ability to recover quickly from damage.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-suited for warm climates and full sun exposure.</p>
