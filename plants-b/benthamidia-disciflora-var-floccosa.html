                    <h1>Benthamidia disciflora var. floccosa</h1>
<p>Benthamidia disciflora var. floccosa, commonly known as the fluffcap lichen, is a foliose lichen characterized by its soft, woolly thallus that gives it a distinctive, fluffy appearance.</p>
<p>It typically grows on rock surfaces in temperate regions, forming dense, cushion-like growths. The lobed, pale to greyish-green lobes are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which contributes to its unique texture. This lichen is known for its slow growth and is often found in shaded, humid environments.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and as a food source for certain invertebrates.</p>
