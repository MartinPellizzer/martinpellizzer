                    <h1>Botrychium × argutum</h1>
<p>Botrychium × argutum, commonly known as the broad-leafed moonwort, is a fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped fronds that are divided into small, finger-like segments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Botrychium × argutum typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
