<p>Bolbitis moranii, commonly known as the Mor√°n's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>Bolbitis moranii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions.</p>
