                    <h1>Beloglottis bifida</h1>
<p>Beloglottis bifida, commonly known as the split-leaf fern, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate leaves that split into numerous narrow segments, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and understory habitats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense clusters.</p>
<p>Beloglottis bifida is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid, indirect light conditions.</p>
