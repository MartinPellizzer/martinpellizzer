                    <h1>Banksia hirta</h1>
<p>Banksia hirta, commonly known as the hairy banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to the south-western region of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes, which are typically yellow to orange in color. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Banksia hirta is adapted to fire-prone environments and exhibits serotiny, where seeds are retained in the cones until a fire triggers their release.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing nectar for a variety of pollinators.</p>
