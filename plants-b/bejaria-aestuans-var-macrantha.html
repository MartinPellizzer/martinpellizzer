                    <h1>Bejaria aestuans var. macrantha</h1>
<p>Bejaria aestuans var. macrantha, commonly known as the coastal bluemouth, is a flowering plant native to the sandy shores of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in tidal zones and dune environments. Its fibrous roots help stabilize coastal dunes, making it an important species for erosion control.</p>
<p>The variety macrantha is distinguished by its larger flowers compared to the typical form of Bejaria aestuans.</p>
