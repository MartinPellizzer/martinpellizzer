<p>Bacopa parvula, commonly known as dwarf water hyssop, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, featuring small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, blue or violet flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Bacopa parvula is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to help stabilize aquatic ecosystems.</p>
