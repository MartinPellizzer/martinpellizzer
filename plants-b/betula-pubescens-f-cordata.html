<p>Betula pubescens f. cordata, commonly known as the Weeping Silver Birch, is a unique form of the silver birch characterized by its pendulous branches that give it a cascading appearance.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree native to northern Europe and parts of Asia, often found in wetlands and along riverbanks. The leaves are ovate and serrated, turning yellow in autumn, while the bark is smooth and white with a silvery sheen. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks.</p>
<p>It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
