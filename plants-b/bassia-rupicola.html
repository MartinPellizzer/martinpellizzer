                    <h1>Bassia rupicola</h1>
<p>Bassia rupicola, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in desert scrub and creosote bush habitats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to its harsh environment. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Bassia rupicola plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
