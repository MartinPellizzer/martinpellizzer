<p>Bromopsis sclerophylla, commonly known as the hard-leaved bentgrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, tough, and leathery leaves that are adapted to arid and nutrient-poor environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which helps in soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Bromopsis sclerophylla is often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, showcasing its resilience to harsh conditions.</p>
