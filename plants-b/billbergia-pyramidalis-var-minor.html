                    <h1>Billbergia pyramidalis var. minor</h1>
<p>Billbergia pyramidalis var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf billbergia, is a compact bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of narrow, dark green, sword-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with vibrant red bracts and yellow flowers, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
