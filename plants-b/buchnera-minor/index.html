                            <h1>Buchnera Minor</h1>
<p>Buchnera minor is a tiny, symbiotic bacterium found in the cells of certain aphid species. It plays a crucial role in providing essential nutrients to its host by synthesizing amino acids that aphids cannot produce on their own. Despite its microscopic size, this bacterium has a significant impact on the biology and survival of its insect hosts. Its genome has been extensively studied to understand the mechanisms of symbiosis and co-evolution. Buchnera minor remains a key model organism in the field of microbial symbiosis research.</p>
