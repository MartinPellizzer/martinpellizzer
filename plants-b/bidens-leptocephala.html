                    <h1>Bidens leptocephala</h1>
<p>Bidens leptocephala, commonly known as the slenderleaf beggarweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellow-orange composite flowers that consist of both ray and disc florets. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in certain areas. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, roadsides, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can outcompete native vegetation, making it a concern in ecological management.</p>
