<p>Bouteloua quiriegoensis, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often found in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear feathery flowers, which are typically pale green to brown in color. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that helps it conserve water.</p>
<p>Sand dropseed is drought-tolerant and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and aesthetic appeal.</p>
