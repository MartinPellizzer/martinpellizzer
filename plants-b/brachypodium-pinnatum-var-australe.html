                    <h1>Brachypodium pinnatum var. australe</h1>
<p>Brachypodium pinnatum var. australe, commonly known as the Australian flat sedge, is a perennial grass native to Australia and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland or riparian habitats, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers are usually green or brown, and it produces small, dry seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
