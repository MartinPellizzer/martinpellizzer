                    <h1>Besleria timida</h1>
<p>Besleria timida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, showy flowers that resemble ghostly shapes, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is often found in protected areas and is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
