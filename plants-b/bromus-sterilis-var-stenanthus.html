<p>Bromus sterilis var. stenanthus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and disturbed soils, and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and locally endemic species.</p>
