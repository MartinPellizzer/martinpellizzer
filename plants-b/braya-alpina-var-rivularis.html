                    <h1>Braya alpina var. rivularis</h1>
<p>Braya alpina var. rivularis, commonly known as the alpine rock白菜, is a flowering plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats or cushions, adapted to harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in high altitudes where few other plants can survive.</p>
