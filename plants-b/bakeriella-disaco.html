<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and purple. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access groundwater during drought periods.</p>
