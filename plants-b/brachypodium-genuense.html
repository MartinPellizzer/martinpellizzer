<p>Brachypodium genuense, commonly known as the narrowleaf basketgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the margins. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and disturbed soils, and is adapted to temperate to subtropical climates.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ecological significance, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
