                    <h1>Baeria chrysostoma f. curta</h1>
<p>Baeria chrysostoma f. curta, commonly known as the short-stemmed yellow bellflower, is a rare and compact variant of the yellow bellflower species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its shorter stems and smaller, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to specific regions in the Mediterranean, this plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
