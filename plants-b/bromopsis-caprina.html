                    <h1>Bromopsis caprina</h1>
<p>Bromopsis caprina, commonly known as the alpine feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce delicate, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows and subalpine zones. Bromopsis caprina is adapted to cold climates and can withstand harsh environmental conditions, including strong winds and low temperatures.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in its native habitats.</p>
