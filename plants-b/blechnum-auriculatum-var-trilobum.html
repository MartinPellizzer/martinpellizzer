<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a lacy appearance. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and establish new colonies. Its fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with the varietal name referring to the distinctive three-lobed shape of the terminal pinnae.</p>
<p>This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests.</p>
