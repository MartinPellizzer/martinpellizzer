<p>Bothriospermum imaii, commonly known as the Imai's bottle tree, is a rare and unique plant native to the island of Socotra.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive bottle-shaped trunk, which stores water to help it survive in arid conditions. The plant has compound leaves with a waxy surface that reduces water loss. Its flowers are small and yellow, appearing in clusters at the base of the leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, Bothriospermum imaii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
