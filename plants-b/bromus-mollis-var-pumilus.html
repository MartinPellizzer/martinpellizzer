<p>Bromus mollis var. pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf brome, is a low-growing grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its fine, soft blades and compact inflorescence. The plant is well-adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and arid environments. Its small stature and drought tolerance make it a valuable component of native plant communities.</p>
<p>It plays a role in preventing soil erosion and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
