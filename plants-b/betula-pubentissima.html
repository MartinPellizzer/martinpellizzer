                    <h1>Betula pubentissima</h1>
<p>Betula pubentissima, commonly known as the pubescent birch, is a deciduous tree native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and white, peeling bark that reveals a yellowish inner layer. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are oval-shaped, with serrated edges, and turn yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>Betula pubentissima is well adapted to cold climates and is often found growing in tundra and boreal forest ecosystems.</p>
