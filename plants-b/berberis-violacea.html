                    <h1>Berberis violacea</h1>
<p>Berberis violacea, commonly known as the violet barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features thorny stems and lance-shaped leaves that turn a striking purple-red color in the fall. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but often bitter. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and seasonal interest throughout the year.</p>
