                    <h1>Bupleurum nipponicum f. stenolepis</h1>
<p>Bupleurum nipponicum f. stenolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Japanese angelica root, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the Bupleurum genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical form. The plant is native to Japan and grows in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions. It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
