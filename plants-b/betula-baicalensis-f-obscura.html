                    <h1>Betula baicalensis f. obscura</h1>
<p>Betula baicalensis f. obscura, commonly known as the dark birch, is a rare variant of the Baikal birch native to the mountainous regions of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark, which distinguishes it from the more common light-colored varieties of birch. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers and oval, serrated leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
