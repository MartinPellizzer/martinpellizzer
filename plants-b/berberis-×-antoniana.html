<p>Berberis × antoniana, commonly known as the Japanese barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan and Korea.</p>
<p>It features thorny stems and small, glossy, dark green leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and seed dispersal.</p>
