                    <h1>Bulbophyllum dolichodon</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum dolichodon, commonly known as the long-beak orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>This epiphytic plant grows on trees and rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. It features a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, with long, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with intricate patterns, typically in shades of yellow and green.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and habitat make it a fascinating subject for botanical study.</p>
