                    <h1>Botrychium ternatum f. silaifolium</h1>
<p>Botrychium ternatum f. silaifolium, commonly known as the silvery-leafed moonwort, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, small, heart-shaped sporangia that are clustered in a central umbel, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and rocky crevices, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and elongated, with a silvery sheen due to the dense covering of trichomes.</p>
<p>This fern is of particular interest to botanists due to its primitive structure and limited distribution.</p>
