                    <h1>Bulbostylis camporum</h1>
<p>Bulbostylis camporum, commonly known as the Camp's bulbostylis, is a small, grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Africa, particularly found in regions with moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces tiny, clustered spikelets that are often hidden among its dense foliage. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
