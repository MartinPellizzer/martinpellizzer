                    <h1>Bletia pallida</h1>
<p>Bletia pallida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Bletia pallida has a unique root system that allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
