<p>Butia punctata, commonly known as the punctate palm, is a striking palm native to the coastal regions of southern Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of long, feather-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into edible, round fruits resembling cherries. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
<p>Butia punctata is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils.</p>
