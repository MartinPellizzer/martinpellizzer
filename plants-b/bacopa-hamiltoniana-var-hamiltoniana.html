<p>Bacopa hamiltoniana var. hamiltoniana, commonly known as the "water bead" or "Java moss," is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, creeping plant that forms dense mats on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater bodies. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically blue or violet in color.</p>
<p>This plant is valued in aquariums and water gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
