<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping to reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Bourreria viridis is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
