                    <h1>Bakerisideroxylon passargei</h1>
<p>Bakerisideroxylon passargei, commonly known as the Socotra cypress, is a unique and rare tree endemic to the Socotra Archipelago.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-shaped crown and thick, flaky bark. The plant has spiral-arranged leaves that are scale-like and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by woody, cone-like structures that contain its seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
