                    <h1>Balanophora simaoensis</h1>
<p>Balanophora simaoensis, commonly known as the Simao ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to China.</p>
<p>It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungi for its nutrients. The plant produces small, white flowers with a distinctive, intricate structure typical of orchids. It grows in dense forest understories, often in association with specific tree species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered critically endangered.</p>
