                    <h1>Barkania punctata</h1>
<p>Barkania punctata, commonly known as the punctate lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green to blackish upper surface and a lighter, often whitish lower surface. The thallus is composed of a symbiotic association between a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga, and a fungal partner. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its unique punctate appearance is due to the arrangement of its vegetative structures.</p>
