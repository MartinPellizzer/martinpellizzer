                    <h1>Benzoin angustifolium var. glabrum</h1>
<p>Benzoin angustifolium var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth benzoin, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are glabrous, or hairless, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by the secretion of a resinous gum known as benzoin. This resin is harvested from the bark and has been used in traditional medicine and incense making.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and commercial contexts.</p>
