<p>Bulbophyllum floribundum, commonly known as the showy orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients, and its linear, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of yellow, orange, and red, during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
