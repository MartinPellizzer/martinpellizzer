<p>Brachycorythis welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitschia, is a unique plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia.</p>
<p>It is a gymnosperm, belonging to the family Welwitschiaceae, and is notable for its two large, strap-like leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant has a thick, woody trunk that stores water, allowing it to survive in the arid environment.</p>
<p>It produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, and it is considered a living fossil due to its ancient lineage and limited distribution.</p>
