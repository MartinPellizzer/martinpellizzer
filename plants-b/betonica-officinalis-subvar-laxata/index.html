                            <h1>Betonica Officinalis Subvar. Laxata</h1>
<p>Laxa betonica, scientifically known as Betonica officinalis subvar. laxata, is a lesser-known member of the Boraginaceae family that has long been valued for its medicinal properties. Native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky soils. Its striking blue to purple flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators and adding a touch of color to alpine landscapes. Despite its historical use in traditional medicine, Laxa betonica remains underappreciated in modern botanical studies. This article explores its ecological significance, traditional uses, and potential for future herbal applications.</p>
