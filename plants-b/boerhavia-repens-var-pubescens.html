                    <h1>Boerhavia repens var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Boerhavia repens var. pubescens, commonly known as mossy bluemink, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, pale blue or pink flowers arranged in clusters, which are often mistaken for moss due to their dense growth habit. Its leaves are typically hairy, giving it a fuzzy appearance and contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>This species is drought-tolerant and often used in xeriscaping due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
