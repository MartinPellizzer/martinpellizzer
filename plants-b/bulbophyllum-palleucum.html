                    <h1>Bulbophyllum palleucum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum palleucum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pale green to white, leaf-like structures that resemble leaves but are actually modified stems. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a subtle iridescence. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
