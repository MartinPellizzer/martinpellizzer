                    <h1>Banisteriopsis inebrians</h1>
<p>Banisteriopsis inebrians, commonly known as the "devil's fig," is a tropical vine native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by fleshy, orange-red fruits. Its most notable botanical feature is the presence of psychoactive compounds, particularly 5-MeO-DMT, which occurs in the seeds.</p>
<p>This makes it a subject of both scientific and ethnobotanical interest.</p>
