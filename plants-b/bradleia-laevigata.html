<p>It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves that are smooth and glossy, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Bradleia laevigata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens.</p>
