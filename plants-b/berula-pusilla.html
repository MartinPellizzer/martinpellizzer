                    <h1>Berula pusilla</h1>
<p>Berula pusilla, commonly known as the small water plantain, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, forming dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in early summer, often in clusters at the base of the stems. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Berula pusilla is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in moist conditions.</p>
