<p>Bersama coriacea, commonly known as the smooth-barked acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by flat, bean-like pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access groundwater.</p>
<p>Bersama coriacea is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil in degraded areas.</p>
