                    <h1>Becquerelia glomerulata</h1>
<p>Becquerelia glomerulata, commonly known as the clustered beard lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly thallus that forms clusters, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant's structure consists of a symbiotic association between a fungal partner and algae or cyanobacteria. It typically grows on bark, soil, or rock surfaces in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in undisturbed forest ecosystems.</p>
