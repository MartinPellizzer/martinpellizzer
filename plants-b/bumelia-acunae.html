<p>Bumelia acunae, commonly known as the Mexican white ash, is a deciduous tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ulmaceae family, which includes ash and elm trees. The plant is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and its opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are usually green on top and paler underneath. Bumelia acunae produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, which are typically wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Its fruit is a small, two-valved samara that disperses seeds by wind, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
