                    <h1>Bulbophyllum ebulbe</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum ebulbe, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, velvety pink petals and a distinctive pouch-like structure at the base of the flower, which is used to trap pollinators. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its leaves are long and strap-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The orchid blooms during the wet season, producing fragrant flowers that attract specific insects for pollination.</p>
