                    <h1>Bolbidium marginatum</h1>
<p>Bolbidium marginatum, commonly known as the marginated lichen, is a saxicolous lichen that thrives on rocky surfaces in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Graphidaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, foliose thallus with a pale green to yellowish color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide photosynthetic capability, while the fungal component offers structural support. It is often found in shaded, moist environments, such as on tree trunks or stone walls.</p>
<p>Bolbidium marginatum is used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to pollutants.</p>
