                    <h1>Bulbophyllum lemnifolium</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum lemnifolium, commonly known as the leafy bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and broad, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated by enthusiasts, though it remains relatively rare in the wild.</p>
