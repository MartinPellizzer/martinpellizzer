                    <h1>Banksia alpina</h1>
<p>Banksia alpina, commonly known as the alpine banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to the south-west of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, woody cones that remain closed for many years before opening to release its seeds. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers, which are arranged in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Banksia alpina is well adapted to fire-prone environments and plays an important role in the ecological dynamics of its region.</p>
