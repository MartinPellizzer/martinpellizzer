<p>Baccharis pingraea, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. It is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Baccharis pingraea plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
