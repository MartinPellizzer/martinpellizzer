<p>Bambusa glaucescens f. elegans, commonly known as the elegant bamboo, is a compact, ornamental grass native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, dark green culms with a striking bluish-gray sheath, giving it a unique visual appeal. The plant grows in dense clumps and produces small, pale green inflorescences during the flowering season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic value.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and compact size, it is ideal for small gardens or as a decorative hedge.</p>
