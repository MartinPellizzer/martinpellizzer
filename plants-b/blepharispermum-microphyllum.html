<p>Blepharispermum microphyllum, commonly known as the dwarf blepharis, is a small, mat-forming succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features tiny, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in dry, sunny environments.</p>
