                    <h1>Buddleja calcicola</h1>
<p>Buddleja calcicola, commonly known as the limestone bush or rock buddleia, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils, particularly on limestone substrates. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, attracting a variety of pollinators such as butterflies and bees. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Buddleja calcicola is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and hardy nature.</p>
