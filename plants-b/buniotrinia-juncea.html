                    <h1>Buniotrinia juncea</h1>
<p>Buniotrinia juncea, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky and arid environments, often found in alpine meadows and mountain slopes. Its fibrous root system helps it anchor in loose, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Buniotrinia juncea is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
