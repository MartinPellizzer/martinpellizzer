<p>Bromus erectus var. pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf brome, is a small perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of only 5â€“15 cm, with slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces compact spikelets that are often tinged with reddish hues, and it blooms from late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
