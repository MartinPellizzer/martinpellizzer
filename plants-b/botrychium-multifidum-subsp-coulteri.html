<p>Botrychium multifidum subsp.</p>
<p>coulteri, commonly known as Coulter's moonwort, is a fern species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length.</p>
<p>The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and habitat make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
