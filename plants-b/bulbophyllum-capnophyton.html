                    <h1>Bulbophyllum capnophyton</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum capnophyton, commonly known as the fire orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red and orange flower spikes, which resemble flames, hence its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom during the dry season, often in clusters along the stems. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Bulbophyllum capnophyton is a epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks rather than in soil.</p>
