                    <h1>Betula pendula var. etnensis</h1>
<p>Betula pendula var. etnensis, commonly known as the Etna birch, is a rare variant of the European white birch.</p>
<p>It is native to the volcanic slopes of Mount Etna in Sicily, where it thrives in the unique microclimate. This variety is characterized by its slender, weeping habit and silver-white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. Its leaves are ovate, with a doubly serrated margin, and it produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is an important component of the alpine vegetation in the region.</p>
