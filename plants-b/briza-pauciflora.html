                    <h1>Briza pauciflora</h1>
<p>Briza pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered quaking grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, arching stems that produce small, spike-like inflorescences with delicate, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a soft, feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Briza pauciflora is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations.</p>
