                    <h1>Bromus multiflorus var. arduennensis</h1>
<p>Bromus multiflorus var. arduennensis, commonly known as the Arduennian brome, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often reach heights of 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to withstand the harsh, cold conditions of its mountainous habitat.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution.</p>
