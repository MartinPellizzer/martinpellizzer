<p>Bivolva involucrata, commonly known as the clustered bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually whorled and may be submerged or floating.</p>
<p>Bivolva involucrata is often found in nutrient-rich waters and can form dense clusters, contributing to the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
