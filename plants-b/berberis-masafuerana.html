                    <h1>Berberis masafuerana</h1>
<p>Berberis masafuerana, commonly known as the Masafuera barberry, is a shrub native to the island of Masafuera in the Gal√°pagos archipelago.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, glossy green leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. It thrives in coastal and dry habitats, adapting well to the arid conditions of its native environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and invasive plants.</p>
