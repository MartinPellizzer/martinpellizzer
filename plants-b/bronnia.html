                    <h1>Bronnia</h1>
<p>Bronnia, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their compact, bushy growth habit and showy, velvety leaves. The flowers, which are typically purple or blue, are borne on long, slender stems and are often clustered together. Bronnia species are popular houseplants due to their ability to thrive in low-light conditions and their ornamental value.</p>
<p>They are also known for their ability to produce offsets, making them relatively easy to propagate.</p>
