                    <h1>Boswellia glabra</h1>
<p>Boswellia glabra, commonly known as frankincense, is a small evergreen tree native to the Arabian Peninsula and parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic resin, which is tapped from its bark and used in incense, perfumes, and traditional medicine. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making it a valuable and often endangered species. Its leaves are alternate, leathery, and have a distinctive scent, while its flowers are small and yellowish-green.</p>
<p>The resin, known as olibanum, contains boswellic acids, which have anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
