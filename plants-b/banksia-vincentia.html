<p>Banksia vincentia, commonly known as the Vincent's banksia, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, woody cone-like inflorescence, which is a defining feature of the Banksia genus. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Banksia vincentia is adapted to fire-prone environments, with its serotinous cones releasing seeds after a fire event.</p>
