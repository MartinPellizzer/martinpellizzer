                    <h1>Bromus cinereus</h1>
<p>Bromus cinereus, commonly known as silver brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and tufted growth habit, which helps it thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous narrow, awned lemmas. Bromus cinereus is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in open woodlands.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife and livestock.</p>
