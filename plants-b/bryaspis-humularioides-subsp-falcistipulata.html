<p>Bryaspis humularioides subsp.</p>
<p>falcistipulata, commonly known as the falcate-tipped clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems that bear whorls of small, scale-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces sporophylls that are elongated and often have a distinctive, curved tip, which is a key identifying feature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its primitive morphology and its role in the study of early plant evolution.</p>
