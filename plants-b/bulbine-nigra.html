<p>Bulbine nigra, commonly known as the black bulbine, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick, underground stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are fleshy, narrow, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Bulbine nigra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine.</p>
