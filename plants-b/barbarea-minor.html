                    <h1>Barbarea minor</h1>
<p>Barbarea minor, commonly known as lesser celandine, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, typically blooming from March to May. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense mats that can outcompete other vegetation.</p>
<p>Barbarea minor is often found in moist, shaded woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
