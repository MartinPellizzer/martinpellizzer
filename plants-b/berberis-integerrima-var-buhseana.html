                    <h1>Berberis integerrima var. buhseana</h1>
<p>Berberis integerrima var. buhseana, commonly known as the Buhse's barberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red-orange berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and persistent berries, which add visual interest throughout the growing season.</p>
