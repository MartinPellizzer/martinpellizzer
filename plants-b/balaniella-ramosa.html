                    <h1>Balaniella ramosa</h1>
<p>Balaniella ramosa, commonly known as the branched broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true roots and its reliance on vascular connections to its hosts. The plant has a branched, often yellowish stem with small, scale-like leaves. It typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions where it attaches to plants such as shrubs or grasses.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth and survival of its host plants.</p>
