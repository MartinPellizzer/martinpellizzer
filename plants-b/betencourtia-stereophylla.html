<p>Betencourtia stereophylla, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a rare and highly valued tropical tree native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark wood with a rich, reddish-brown color and a fine, uniform grain. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. Betencourtia stereophylla is known for its slow growth and long lifespan, making it a valuable resource in traditional craftsmanship.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now critically endangered and protected in many regions.</p>
