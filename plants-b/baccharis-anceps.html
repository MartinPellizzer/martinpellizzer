<p>Baccharis anceps, commonly known as the coastal baccharis, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves and small, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant is adapted to sandy soils and salt spray, making it resilient in coastal environments. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Baccharis anceps is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in harsh conditions.</p>
