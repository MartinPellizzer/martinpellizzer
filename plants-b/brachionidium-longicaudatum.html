<p>Brachionidium longicaudatum, commonly known as the long-tailed brachionid, is a type of rotifer found in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, whip-like tail, which aids in locomotion through water. The organism has a transparent, barrel-shaped body with a crown of cilia used for feeding. It plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by grazing on algae and other microscopic particles.</p>
<p>Due to its sensitivity to environmental changes, it is often used as an indicator species in water quality assessments.</p>
