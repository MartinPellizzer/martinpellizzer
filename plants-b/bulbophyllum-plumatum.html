                    <h1>Bulbophyllum plumatum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum plumatum, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking pink and white flowers that resemble a slipper, hence its common name. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat. Its roots are adapted to grow in epiphytic conditions, often attaching to trees in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The flowers typically bloom in summer and are pollinated by specific insects, contributing to its ecological significance.</p>
