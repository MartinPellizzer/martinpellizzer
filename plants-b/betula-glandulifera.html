                    <h1>Betula glandulifera</h1>
<p>Betula glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, followed by triangular, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and have serrated edges, turning yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forested wetlands.</p>
