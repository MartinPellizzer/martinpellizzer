                    <h1>Bombyx</h1>
<p>Bombyx, commonly known as the silkworm, is a species of moth whose larvae are widely cultivated for silk production.</p>
<p>The plant aspect of Bombyx refers to the mulberry tree, which is its primary food source. Silkworms feed on the leaves of the mulberry, which are rich in nutrients necessary for their growth and silk production. The botanical significance of mulberry lies in its role as a host plant for Bombyx and its economic importance in sericulture.</p>
<p>The relationship between Bombyx and mulberry is a classic example of mutualism in agricultural ecosystems.</p>
