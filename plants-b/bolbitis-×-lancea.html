                    <h1>Bolbitis × lancea</h1>
<p>Bolbitis × lancea, commonly known as the lance-leaf fern, is a hybrid fern species that combines traits from its parent plants, Bolbitis heterophylla and Bolbitis heudelotii.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly glossy surface. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Bolbitis × lancea thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening.</p>
