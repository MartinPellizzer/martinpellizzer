<p>Botrypus strictus, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of aquatic fern found in shallow, freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive feathery appearance with delicate, branching fronds that float on the water surface. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on rhizomes to anchor itself in muddy substrates. Its fronds are composed of small, closely packed pinnae that help maximize light absorption for photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Botrypus strictus plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water organisms.</p>
