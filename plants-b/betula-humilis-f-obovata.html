<p>Betula humilis f. obovata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf birch, is a shrub-like form of the dwarf birch.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its obovate, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant typically grows in cold, boreal or alpine environments, preferring well-drained, acidic soils. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its hardiness and ability to thrive in harsh climatic conditions.</p>
