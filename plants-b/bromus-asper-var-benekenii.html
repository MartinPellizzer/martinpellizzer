                    <h1>Bromus asper var. benekenii</h1>
<p>Bromus asper var. benekenii, commonly known as the rough brome, is a perennial grass species native to the high-elevation regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability to harsh environments, it plays a significant role in stabilizing soil in mountainous regions.</p>
