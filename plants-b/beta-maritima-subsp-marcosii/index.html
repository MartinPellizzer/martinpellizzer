                            <h1>Beta Maritima Subsp. Marcosii</h1>
<p>Sea beet, scientifically known as Beta maritima subsp. marcosii, is a hardy coastal plant that thrives in salty, windy environments. It is native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe, where it often grows along rocky shores and dunes. This subspecies is distinguished by its thick, fleshy leaves and small, edible green seeds that are rich in nutrients. Despite its tough exterior, it plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife. Its resilience and adaptability make it a fascinating subject for ecological and botanical study.</p>
