                    <h1>Blaeria breviflora var. aberdarica</h1>
<p>Blaeria breviflora var. aberdarica, commonly known as the Aberdaric Blaeria, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Aberdaric Mountains.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. The leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps to reflect excess sunlight in its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
