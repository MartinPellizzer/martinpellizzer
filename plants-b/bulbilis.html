<p>Bulbilis, commonly known as the bulbil plant, is a unique species characterized by its ability to produce small, vegetative propagules called bulbils.</p>
<p>These bulbils are typically formed on the stems or leaves and can detach to grow into new plants, allowing for asexual reproduction. The plant often thrives in rocky or arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its botanical structure includes a fibrous root system and fleshy, succulent stems that store water.</p>
<p>Bulbilis is valued in horticulture for its ease of propagation and resilience.</p>
