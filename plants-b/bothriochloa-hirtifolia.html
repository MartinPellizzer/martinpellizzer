<p>Bothriochloa hirtifolia, commonly known as hairy brome, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, savannas, and disturbed soils, often forming dense mats or tufts. The plant has narrow, hairy leaves and spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the stem. Its inflorescence consists of slender, spike-like structures that bear small, two-rowed florets.</p>
<p>Bothriochloa hirtifolia is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environments.</p>
