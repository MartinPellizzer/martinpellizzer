                    <h1>Berberis sinensis var. paphlagonica</h1>
<p>Berberis sinensis var. paphlagonica, commonly known as the Paphlagonian barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Turkey and the Caucasus region.</p>
<p>It features thorned stems and alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible but tart. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and seasonal berries, though it can be invasive in some regions.</p>
