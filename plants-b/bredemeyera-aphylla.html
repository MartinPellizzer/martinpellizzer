<p>Bredemeyera aphylla, commonly known as the leafless cycad, is a unique plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, instead having a stout, unbranched trunk. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, typical of cycads. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
