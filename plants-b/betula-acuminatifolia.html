<p>Betula acuminatifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are a key feature of its reproductive cycle. Its bark is smooth and pale, often developing fissures as the tree matures.</p>
<p>Betula acuminatifolia is adapted to cold climates and is often found in high-altitude forests and alpine environments.</p>
