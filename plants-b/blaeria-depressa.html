                    <h1>Blaeria depressa</h1>
<p>Blaeria depressa, commonly known as the flat bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, bladder-like structures that serve as traps for small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, while the bladders are the primary photosynthetic organs.</p>
<p>Blaeria depressa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
