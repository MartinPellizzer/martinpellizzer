                    <h1>Brachychloa fragilis</h1>
<p>Brachychloa fragilis, commonly known as the slender hairgrass, is a small annual grass species native to Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, which aids in its colonization of disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its fragile nature, it is often found in ephemeral habitats where it completes its life cycle quickly.</p>
