                    <h1>Barreliera</h1>
<p>Barreliera, commonly known as the bottle tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their swollen, bottle-shaped trunks that store water, allowing them to survive in arid environments. Native to Australia, Barreliera species are often found in dry woodlands and scrublands. The leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a spiral pattern, while the flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to their unique appearance and ability to thrive in harsh conditions, they are sometimes cultivated as ornamental plants.</p>
