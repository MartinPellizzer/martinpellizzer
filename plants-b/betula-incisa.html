                    <h1>Betula incisa</h1>
<p>Betula incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf birch, is a deciduous tree native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with silver on the underside. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are a key feature of its reproductive cycle. Its bark is smooth and pale, becoming fissured with age, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Betula incisa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems.</p>
