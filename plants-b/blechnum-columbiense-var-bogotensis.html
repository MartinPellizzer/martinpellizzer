                    <h1>Blechnum columbiense var. bogotensis</h1>
<p>Blechnum columbiense var. bogotensis, commonly known as the Bogot√° spleenworts, is a fern native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as cloud forests and rocky habitats. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of rhizome scales, which aid in water retention.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a leathery texture that helps it withstand the humid and often cold conditions of its native range.</p>
