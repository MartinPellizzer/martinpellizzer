                    <h1>Boerhavia annulata</h1>
<p>Boerhavia annulata, commonly known as the redroot sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with fleshy, succulent stems and small, pink to red flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a shallow root system that allows it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are typically alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind.</p>
<p>Boerhavia annulata is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and wound-healing properties.</p>
