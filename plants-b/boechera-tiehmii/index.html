                            <h1>Boechera Tiehmii</h1>
<p>Boechera tiehmii is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is known for its small, white or pale purple blooms that appear in late spring. This species is often found in rocky soil and high elevation environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered in many areas. Its unique characteristics make it an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
