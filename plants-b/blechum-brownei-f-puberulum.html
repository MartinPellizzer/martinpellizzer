<p>It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its unique foliage, featuring hairy, lance-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its flowers are small and clustered, often white or greenish in color, and it produces berries that are an important food source for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
