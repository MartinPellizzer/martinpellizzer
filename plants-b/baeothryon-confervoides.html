<p>Baeothryon confervoides, commonly known as the green alga, is a species of green algae belonging to the class Chlorophyceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its filamentous structure, with cells arranged in unbranched filaments that can form dense, turf-like colonies. This plant thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in slow-moving streams and ponds, where it attaches to substrates such as rocks or submerged vegetation. Its chloroplasts contain chlorophyll a and b, enabling it to perform photosynthesis efficiently.</p>
<p>Baeothryon confervoides plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to primary production and serving as a food source for various aquatic organisms.</p>
