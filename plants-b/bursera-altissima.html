                    <h1>Bursera altissima</h1>
<p>Bursera altissima, commonly known as the gum tree or sweet gum tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and dense, rounded crown, which provides habitat for various wildlife species. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers followed by distinctive, three-lobed, spiny fruits that contain toxic seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its tropical environment.</p>
<p>Bursera altissima is also valued for its aromatic resin, which has been used traditionally for medicinal and aromatic purposes.</p>
