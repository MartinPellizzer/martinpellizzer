<p>Balania kudoi, commonly known as the Kudoi balanida, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Balanophoraceae, which consists of parasitic plants. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, making it a hemiparasite. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically green or yellow in color.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Balania kudoi is considered an endangered species.</p>
