                    <h1>Buchnera tomentosa</h1>
<p>Buchnera tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species. The plant is characterized by its dense, white tomentose (fuzzy) coating, which covers its stems and leaves. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or pale yellow.</p>
<p>Buchnera tomentosa is often found in disturbed soils and can be an indicator of certain ecological conditions.</p>
