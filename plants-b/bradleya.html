                    <h1>Bradleya</h1>
<p>Bradleya, commonly known as the "flower of the gods," is a genus of flowering plants native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their striking, showy inflorescences that resemble a crown of flowers, often with a mix of colors ranging from white to pink and purple. Bradleya species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees without being parasitic, and they rely on humid, shaded environments for survival. Their flowers are typically short-lived, blooming for only a few days before fading, which adds to their rarity and allure.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, many Bradleya species are now considered endangered.</p>
