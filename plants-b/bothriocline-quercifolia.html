                    <h1>Bothriocline quercifolia</h1>
<p>Bothriocline quercifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and fleshy, often sticky berries. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in dense forests.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of the ecosystems it inhabits.</p>
