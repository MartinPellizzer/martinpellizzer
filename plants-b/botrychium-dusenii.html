                    <h1>Botrychium dusenii</h1>
<p>Botrychium dusenii, commonly known as the Dusen's moonwort, is a small fern belonging to the family Onocleaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single, erect, leaf-like structure called a sorus that bears spore-producing structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Botrychium dusenii is native to parts of North America, particularly in the western United States.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for undisturbed, moist habitats.</p>
