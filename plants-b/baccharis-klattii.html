<p>Baccharis klattii, commonly known as Klatt's baccharis, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, often spiny foliage and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with thick leaves that reduce water loss and deep roots that access groundwater. It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Baccharis klattii is also used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities for its purported health benefits.</p>
