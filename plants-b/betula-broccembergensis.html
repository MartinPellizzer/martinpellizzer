                    <h1>Betula broccembergensis</h1>
<p>Betula broccembergensis, commonly known as the Borneo birch, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the mountainous regions of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 10â€“15 meters, characterized by its smooth, white bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of the rainforest ecosystem, though it remains understudied due to its limited distribution.</p>
