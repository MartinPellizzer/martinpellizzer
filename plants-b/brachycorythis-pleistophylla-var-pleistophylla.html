                    <h1>Brachycorythis pleistophylla var. pleistophylla</h1>
<p>Brachycorythis pleistophylla var. pleistophylla, commonly known as the pleistophylla cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant exhibits dioecious reproduction, with separate male and female plants, and produces cones for seed dispersal. Its botanical structure reflects its evolutionary adaptation to tropical and subtropical environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
