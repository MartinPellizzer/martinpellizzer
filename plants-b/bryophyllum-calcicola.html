                    <h1>Bryophyllum calcicola</h1>
<p>Bryophyllum calcicola, commonly known as the limestone leaf plant, is a unique member of the Crassulaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a succulent plant characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Native to rocky and calcareous soils in southern Africa, it is well adapted to harsh, sun-exposed conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, typically during the summer months.</p>
<p>Its ability to propagate through leaf cuttings makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
