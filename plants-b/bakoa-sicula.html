<p>Bakoa sicula, commonly known as the Sicilian orchid, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the island of Sicily.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its Mediterranean climate. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Bakoa sicula is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
