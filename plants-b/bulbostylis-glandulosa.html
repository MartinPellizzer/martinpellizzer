                    <h1>Bulbostylis glandulosa</h1>
<p>Bulbostylis glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular bulbostylis, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, often tufted foliage. The plant produces tiny, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, greenish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in wet or moist soils.</p>
<p>Bulbostylis glandulosa is often found in marshy areas, stream banks, and other wetland habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
