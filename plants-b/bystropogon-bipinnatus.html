<p>Bystropogon bipinnatus, commonly known as the slender featherleaf, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage with finely divided leaves that give it a lacy appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers arranged in panicles, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers.</p>
<p>Bystropogon bipinnatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively low maintenance once established.</p>
