<p>Buchnera coccinea, commonly known as the red bugweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Onagraceae family, which includes species such as willow flowers and evening primroses. The plant is characterized by its bright red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Buchnera coccinea is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and forest edges.</p>
