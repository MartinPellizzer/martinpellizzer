                    <h1>Bermudiana palmifolia</h1>
<p>Bermudiana palmifolia, commonly known as the Bermuda grass, is a species of grass native to the coastal areas of Bermuda.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and a dense, mat-like growth habit that helps prevent soil erosion. The plant is well adapted to sandy soils and salty air, making it highly resilient in coastal environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and maintaining the ecological balance of beach ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is also widely used in landscaping and turfgrass applications.</p>
