<p>Bargemontia eremobia, commonly known as the desert germander, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with gray-green, hairy foliage adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access moisture from underground sources.</p>
<p>Bargemontia eremobia is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
