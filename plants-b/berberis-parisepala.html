                    <h1>Berberis parisepala</h1>
<p>Berberis parisepala, commonly known as the white-flowered barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its winter interest, as the stems retain their color throughout the colder months.</p>
