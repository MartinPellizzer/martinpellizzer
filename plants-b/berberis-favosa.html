<p>Berberis favosa, commonly known as the yellow barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the autumn. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but not widely consumed by humans.

<p>Berberis favosa is also valued for its historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
