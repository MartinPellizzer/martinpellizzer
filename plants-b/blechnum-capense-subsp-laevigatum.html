<p>Blechnum capense subsp.</p>
<p>laevigatum, commonly known as the smooth frond fern, is a species of fern native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically lance-shaped and have a smooth texture.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the propagation of the plant.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
