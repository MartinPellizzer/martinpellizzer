<p>It features small, narrow leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length, arranged oppositely along its stems. The plant produces tiny, blue to violet flowers that bloom in clusters, often floating just above the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often used in water gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Bacopa tweediei is also known for its ability to improve water clarity by absorbing nutrients and stabilizing sediment.</p>
