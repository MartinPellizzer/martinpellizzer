                    <h1>Batrachium usneoides</h1>
<p>Batrachium usneoides, commonly known as the mossy beard lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms dense, cushion-like growths on tree trunks and branches.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright green to yellowish-green thallus, which is often covered with a fine, woolly layer of filaments. The lichen thrives in moist, shaded environments and is typically found in temperate and tropical regions. It plays an important role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
<p>Its structure consists of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungus, which enables it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
