<p>Brachyloma tubiflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mountain everlasting, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It features compact, bushy growth with small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers during the autumn season, which are borne on short, hairy stems. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained soils, often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Brachyloma tubiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in native gardens.</p>
