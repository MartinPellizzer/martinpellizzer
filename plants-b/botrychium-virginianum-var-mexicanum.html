<p>Botrychium virginianum var. mexicanum, commonly known as the Mexican moonwort, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Ophioglossaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, and often spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a cup-like formation at the tip of its sterile fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or along stream banks, and is found in parts of North America and Mexico. Its morphology includes a short, thick rhizome with a single, broad, and often divided leaf.</p>
<p>The species is noted for its primitive features and is of interest to botanists studying the evolution of ferns.</p>
