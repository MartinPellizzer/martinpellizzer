                    <h1>Begonia concinna</h1>
<p>Begonia concinna, commonly known as the silver leaf begonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that often display a silvery or white variegation. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or red, which bloom during the warm season. It thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings.</p>
