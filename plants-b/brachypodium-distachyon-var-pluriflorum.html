                    <h1>Brachypodium distachyon var. pluriflorum</h1>
<p>Brachypodium distachyon var. pluriflorum, commonly known as the multibranched false brome, is a grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, tufted foliage. The plant produces multiple flowering shoots, giving it its varietal name "pluriflorum," which means "many-flowered" in Latin. Its inflorescence consists of two spikelets, each bearing several small, spike-like flowers.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological studies and as a model organism due to its genetic simplicity and adaptability.</p>
