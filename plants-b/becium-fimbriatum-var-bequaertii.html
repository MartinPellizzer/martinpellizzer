<p>Becium fimbriatum var. bequaertii, commonly known as the Cape fimbriate lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, irregularly lobed thallus with a pale to dark green upper surface and a white to cream-colored lower surface. The species is often found growing on tree bark in humid, temperate climates, particularly in regions of South Africa. Its structure consists of a cortex, medulla, and algal layer, with the algal partner being Trebouxia.</p>
<p>This lichen is known for its slow growth and is often used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants.</p>
