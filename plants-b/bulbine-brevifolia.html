                    <h1>Bulbine brevifolia</h1>
<p>Bulbine brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulbine, is a perennial succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ability to store water in its leaves makes it drought-tolerant and ideal for arid environments.</p>
