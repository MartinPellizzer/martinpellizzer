<p>Barringtonia martensii, commonly known as the Malabar candlewood, is a tropical tree native to the coastal regions of southern India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and distinctive, candle-like inflorescences that hang from the branches. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in local medicine.</p>
