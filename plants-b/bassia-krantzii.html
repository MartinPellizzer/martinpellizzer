                    <h1>Bassia krantzii</h1>
<p>Bassia krantzii, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring or early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Bassia krantzii is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in dry gardens.</p>
