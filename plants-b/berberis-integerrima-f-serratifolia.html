The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often bitter. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its potential medicinal properties, though its toxicity should be considered.</p>
