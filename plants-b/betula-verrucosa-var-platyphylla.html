                    <h1>Betula verrucosa var. platyphylla</h1>
<p>Betula verrucosa var. platyphylla, commonly known as the smooth birch, is a variant of the paper birch characterized by its smooth, white bark that lacks the flaky texture of the typical species.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree native to the northern regions of North America, where it thrives in cold climates and well-drained soils. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, turning yellow in the fall before dropping. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are male and female flowers, and its seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
