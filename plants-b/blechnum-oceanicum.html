<p>Blechnum oceanicum, commonly known as the oceanic holly fern, is a species of fern native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery powder, which helps to reduce water loss in its saline environment. The plant thrives in rocky, coastal areas and is adapted to withstand strong winds and salt spray. Its fronds are typically divided into narrow, serrated segments, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Blechnum oceanicum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
