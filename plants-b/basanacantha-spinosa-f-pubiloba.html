                    <h1>Basanacantha spinosa f. pubiloba</h1>
<p>Basanacantha spinosa f. pubiloba, commonly known as the hairy spiny nightshade, is a variant of the Basanacantha spinosa species, characterized by its pubescent (hairy) foliage and spiny stems.</p>
<p>This plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky soils and dry conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough, textured surface. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in umbels, while the fruit is a fleshy berry that turns red when mature.</p>
<p>Due to its spines and toxic properties, it is often avoided by herbivores and requires careful handling.</p>
