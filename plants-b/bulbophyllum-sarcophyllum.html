                    <h1>Bulbophyllum sarcophyllum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum sarcophyllum, commonly known as the stone orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, rock-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often blooming during the rainy season. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This orchid is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in terrariums or as a houseplant.</p>
