<p>Begonia relicta, commonly known as the relic begonia, is a rare and ancient species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, velvety foliage and clusters of delicate, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of red and pink. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and historical significance make it a prized specimen among botanists and plant enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Begonia relicta is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes.</p>
