                    <h1>Baccharis illinitoides</h1>
<p>Baccharis illinitoides, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems and dense growth habit make it a hardy, drought-tolerant species suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Baccharis illinitoides plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
