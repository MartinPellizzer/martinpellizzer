<p>Haast's daisy, scientifically known as Brachyglottis haastii, is a striking native plant of New Zealand's South Island. This species is named after the famous explorer and naturalist, Julius von Haast, who played a key role in documenting New Zealand's flora. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring and summer. The plant thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, Haast's daisy is a valuable symbol of New Zealand's natural heritage.</p>
