                    <h1>Bromus caprearum</h1>
<p>Bromus caprearum, commonly known as the coastal brome, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of southern Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along cliffs and dunes, where it is adapted to harsh, salty environments. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to reddish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Bromus caprearum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
