<p>Belvisia validinervis, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Viscaraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the humid forests of Central and South America, where it attaches to the branches of host trees such as ceiba and mahogany. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a dense network of veins. Its flowers are pale yellow and clustered in small inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if left unchecked, making it both ecologically significant and potentially damaging to forest ecosystems.</p>
