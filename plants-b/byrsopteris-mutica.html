<p>Byrsopteris mutica, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, linear fronds with a serrated margin, and its rhizomes are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. It produces spores in clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the late spring and summer months.</p>
<p>Byrsopteris mutica is often found in temperate regions and is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
