<p>Bulbophyllum tripudians var. pumilum, commonly known as the miniature dancing orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact growth habit with short, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces delicate, pendulous flowers in shades of white and yellow, often resembling tiny, dancing figures. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
