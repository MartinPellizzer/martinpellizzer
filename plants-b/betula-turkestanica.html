<p>Betula turkestanica, commonly known as the Turkestan birch, is a deciduous tree native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are triangular and serrated, turning yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>Betula turkestanica is adapted to cold, mountainous environments and is often found in alpine regions.</p>
