                    <h1>Berberis vulgaris var. microphylla</h1>
<p>Berberis vulgaris var. microphylla, commonly known as creeping barberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red-orange berries that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. Its dense growth habit makes it suitable for ground cover, and it is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>The plant contains berberine, a compound with medicinal properties, though it is not typically consumed due to its bitter taste and potential toxicity.</p>
