<p>Bivonea urens, commonly known as the bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant that thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant is native to various regions, including North America and Europe, and is often found in moist soils or shallow water. Its unique method of obtaining nutrients through prey capture makes it an interesting subject in botanical studies.</p>
