                    <h1>Blennoderma</h1>
<p>Blennoderma, commonly known as the glassy-winged sharpshooter, is a type of planthopper native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated body and transparent wings that give it a distinctive, glass-like appearance. The plant is primarily associated with its role as a vector for plant pathogens, particularly the bacterium *Xylella fastidiosa*. Blennoderma feeds on the xylem sap of various plants, including grapevines and citrus trees.</p>
<p>Its feeding habits can cause severe damage to crops, making it a significant agricultural pest.</p>
