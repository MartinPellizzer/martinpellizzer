                    <h1>Botrychium australe var. erosum</h1>
<p>Botrychium australe var. erosum, commonly known as the Australian moonwort, is a fern-like plant native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like fronds that are often covered in a dense, woolly coating. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically clustered in a ring near the base of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
