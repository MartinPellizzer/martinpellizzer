                    <h1>Bureavella unmackiana</h1>
<p>Bureavella unmackiana, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, silvery-gray leaves that reflect sunlight, reducing water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late spring. Its fruit is a rounded capsule that splits open to release tiny, poisonous seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by herbivores, allowing it to thrive in competitive ecosystems.</p>
