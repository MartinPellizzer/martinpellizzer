                    <h1>Bulbophyllum jiewhoei</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum jiewhoei, commonly known as the Jiewhoe's ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, translucent greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
