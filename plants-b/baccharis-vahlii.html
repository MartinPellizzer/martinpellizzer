                    <h1>Baccharis vahlii</h1>
<p>Baccharis vahlii, commonly known as the desert baccharis, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and small, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is adapted to withstand drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss, and it produces small, dry fruits that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Baccharis vahlii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
