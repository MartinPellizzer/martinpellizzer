                    <h1>Buda borealis</h1>
<p>Buda borealis, commonly known as the northern twilight flower, is a rare perennial plant native to the Arctic tundra.</p>
<p>It features delicate, pale blue petals that resemble the colors of the aurora borealis, hence its scientific name. The plant has a low-growing habit with a rosette of silver-green leaves that help it retain heat in cold climates. It blooms once a year during the brief summer season, relying on pollinators like bees and flies.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor, freezing environments.</p>
