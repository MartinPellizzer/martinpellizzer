<p>Baccharoides longepedunculata, commonly known as the long peduncle baccharoid, is a shrub native to the wetlands of southeastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often drooping stems and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in marshy or swampy areas, thriving in moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slight sheen, and it produces small, dark berries that are an important food source for wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
