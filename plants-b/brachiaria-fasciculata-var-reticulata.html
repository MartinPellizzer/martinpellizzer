                    <h1>Brachiaria fasciculata var. reticulata</h1>
<p>Brachiaria fasciculata var. reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined buffalograss, is a perennial grass native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive net-like vein pattern. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in forage and erosion control in certain regions.</p>
