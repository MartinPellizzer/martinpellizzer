                    <h1>Boswellia serrata</h1>
<p>Boswellia serrata, commonly known as Indian frankincense, is a small deciduous tree native to the dry regions of India, the Middle East, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grayish-barked trunk and slender, branching structure, with leaves that are alternate and pinnately compound. The plant produces a resinous sap, known as frankincense, which is harvested from incisions made in its bark. This sap is rich in boswellic acids, which have been studied for their anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>Boswellia serrata is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic benefits.</p>
