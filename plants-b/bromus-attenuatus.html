                    <h1>Bromus attenuatus</h1>
<p>Bromus attenuatus, commonly known as slender brome, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Bromus attenuatus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
