                    <h1>Banksia seneciifolia</h1>
<p>Banksia seneciifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow, grey-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking yellow to orange flower spikes in late winter to early spring, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody cone-like structures, called follicles, contain seeds that are released after a fire, aiding in its regeneration.</p>
<p>Banksia seneciifolia is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is a valuable component of the region's biodiversity.</p>
