                    <h1>Bromus hookeri var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Bromus hookeri var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent brome, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, hairy blades that give it its varietal name. The plant typically thrives in rocky or well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spikelet that is often subtended by a bract.</p>
<p>This grass is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its adaptation to high-altitude conditions and its role in stabilizing soil in rugged terrain.</p>
