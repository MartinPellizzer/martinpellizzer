<p>Bhesa, commonly known as the Indian nettle or Urena lobata, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its upright stems and opposite leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by hairy, three-lobed seed pods. Bhesa thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a useful plant for soil stabilization and a potential weed in cultivated areas.</p>
