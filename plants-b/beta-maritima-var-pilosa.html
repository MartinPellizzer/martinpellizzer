                    <h1>Beta maritima var. pilosa</h1>
<p>Beta maritima var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy sea beet, is a perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, succulent leaves that are covered in fine, hairy pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in saline soils and is often found along shores, dunes, and rocky coastlines.</p>
<p>Its robust growth and adaptability make it a hardy species well-suited to harsh maritime conditions.</p>
