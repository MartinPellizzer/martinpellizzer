                    <h1>Brachysiphon ericifolius</h1>
<p>Brachysiphon ericifolius, commonly known as the heathleaf pygmy orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with hairy stems and narrow, leathery leaves that resemble heath plants. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers clustered in a spike, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, coastal conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
