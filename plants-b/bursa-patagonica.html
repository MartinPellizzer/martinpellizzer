<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spiky, seed-bearing structures. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in a tough, burs-like casing, which aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing.</p>
<p>Bursa patagonica is often found in dry, open habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid conditions.</p>
