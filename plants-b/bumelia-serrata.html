<p>Bumelia serrata, commonly known as the roughleaf bumelia, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, serrated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by distinctive, spiny seed capsules. Its bark is thick and fissured, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils in woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Bumelia serrata is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its botanical properties remain under scientific study.</p>
