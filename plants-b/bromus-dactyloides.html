                    <h1>Bromus dactyloides</h1>
<p>Bromus dactyloides, commonly known as buffalograss, is a native perennial grass species found primarily in the central and western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, clump-forming habit and fine, silver-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Buffalograss is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it a valuable native grass for landscaping and restoration projects.</p>
<p>Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion and supports a variety of wildlife.</p>
