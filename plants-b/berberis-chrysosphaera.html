                    <h1>Berberis chrysosphaera</h1>
<p>Berberis chrysosphaera, commonly known as the golden globe barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and vibrant yellow foliage, which becomes especially striking in the autumn. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but often bitter. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that it can be invasive in certain regions if not properly managed.</p>
