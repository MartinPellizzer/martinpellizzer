<p>Betula ludmilae, commonly known as the Ludmila birch, is a rare and unique species of birch native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray bark that becomes more pronounced with age, and its small, triangular leaves that are typically pale green on the upper surface. The plant produces catkins that are often yellowish in color, and its flowers are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>Betula ludmilae is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is considered a valuable species for botanical research due to its limited distribution and unique ecological role.</p>
