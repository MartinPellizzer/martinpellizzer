                    <h1>Bulbophyllum umbellatum var. bergemannii</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum umbellatum var. bergemannii, commonly known as the Bergemann's lady's slipper, is a rare and exquisite orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, velvety purple petals and a distinctive, pouch-like labellum that resembles a slipper. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a fragrant, showy display.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this variety is considered endangered and is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts.</p>
