<p>Bromopsis pumpelliana var. flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible bromus, is a perennial grass species native to the Andes mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, flexible stems that often bend with the wind. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that helps it blend into its mountainous habitat.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soils.</p>
