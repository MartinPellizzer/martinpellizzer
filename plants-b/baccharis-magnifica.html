                    <h1>Baccharis magnifica</h1>
<p>Baccharis magnifica, commonly known as the California buckthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny branches and small, dark green leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain areas outside its native range.</p>
