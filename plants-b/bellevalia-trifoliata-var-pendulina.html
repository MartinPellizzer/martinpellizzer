                    <h1>Bellevalia trifoliata var. pendulina</h1>
<p>Bellevalia trifoliata var. pendulina, commonly known as the hanging bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often pendulous stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet. The leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, which are typically lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem. This variety thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable plant for rock gardens or alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and the way its flowers dangle from the stems.</p>
