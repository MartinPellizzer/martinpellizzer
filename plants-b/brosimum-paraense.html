                    <h1>Brosimum paraense</h1>
<p>Brosimum paraense, commonly known as the Paraense rubber tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the Amazon Basin, particularly in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its latex, similar to that of the rubber tree, has been used traditionally for various purposes.</p>
<p>However, it is less commercially significant than other rubber-producing plants.</p>
