<p>Betula delavayi var. forrestii, commonly known as the Yunnan birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, and its alternate, simple leaves that are elliptical in shape. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude forests, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of its habitat.</p>
