                    <h1>Botrychium arisanense</h1>
<p>Botrychium arisanense, commonly known as the Arisan moonwort, is a rare fern species native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Onocleaceae and is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a fleshy, segmented rhizome and a small, heart-shaped frond. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in a distinctive, umbrella-like structure called a sorus. Botrychium arisanense thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in mountainous regions with rich, humus-filled soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
