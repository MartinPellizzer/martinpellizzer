                    <h1>Balanophora indica var. agastyamalayana</h1>
<p>Balanophora indica var. agastyamalayana, commonly known as the Agastyamalaya ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrition. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers with a unique, intricate structure typical of orchids. It thrives in shaded, moist forest understories, often growing on tree trunks or roots.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
