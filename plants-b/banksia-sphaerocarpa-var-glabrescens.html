<p>Banksia sphaerocarpa var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical or spherical flower spikes, which are typically yellow or orange in color. The leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of whitish or greyish hairs. This variety is notable for its reduced leaf pubescence compared to other banksia species, giving it a smoother appearance.</p>
