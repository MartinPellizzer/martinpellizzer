<p>Botrypus lanuginosus subsp.</p>
<p>leptostachys, commonly known as the slender-stalked water fern, is a member of the fern family (Polypodiaceae). It is characterized by its delicate, hairy fronds that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is known for its unique morphology and ecological adaptability in wetland ecosystems.</p>
