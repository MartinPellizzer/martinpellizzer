                    <h1>Buchnera tenella</h1>
<p>Buchnera tenella, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its root system is shallow but dense, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Buchnera tenella plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range.</p>
