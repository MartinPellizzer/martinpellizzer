                    <h1>Briza subaristata var. interrupta</h1>
<p>Briza subaristata var. interrupta, commonly known as the interrupted false oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce delicate, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>The species is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
