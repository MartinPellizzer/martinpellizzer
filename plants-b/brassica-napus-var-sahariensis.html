                    <h1>Brassica napus var. sahariensis</h1>
<p>Brassica napus var. sahariensis, commonly known as the Saharan mustard, is a wild Brassicaceae species native to arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves adapted to withstand harsh desert conditions. The plant produces small, spherical pods containing several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and can tolerate high temperatures and limited water availability.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for drought resistance and genetic diversity.</p>
