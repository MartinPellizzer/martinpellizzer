<p>Byrsa, commonly known as the common lousewort, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially depends on its host for nutrients while still performing some photosynthesis. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are small and often clustered in dense inflorescences, usually in shades of pink, red, or purple.</p>
<p>Byrsa has a distinctive root system that allows it to establish itself in a variety of soil types.</p>
