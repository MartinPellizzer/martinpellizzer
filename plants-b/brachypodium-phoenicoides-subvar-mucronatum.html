<p>Brachypodium phoenicoides subvar. mucronatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf false brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and sagebrush habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
