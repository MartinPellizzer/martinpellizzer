<p>Buddleja limitanea, commonly known as the narrowleaf buddleia, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or gray pubescence. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of purple or blue, which bloom in summer. Buddleja limitanea is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a hardy choice for gardens in dry climates.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees.</p>
