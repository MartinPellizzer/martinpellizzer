                    <h1>Bromus fasciculatus var. fallax</h1>
<p>Bromus fasciculatus var. fallax, commonly known as fallax brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and rocky areas. The plant has slender,丛生 (tufted) growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and resilience.</p>
