The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters along the stems. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
