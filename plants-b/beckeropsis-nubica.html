                    <h1>Beckeropsis nubica</h1>
<p>Beckeropsis nubica, commonly known as the cloud cushion, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange, adding a vibrant touch to its otherwise muted appearance. Its leaves are thick and waxy, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Beckeropsis nubica is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
