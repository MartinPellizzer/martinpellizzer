<p>Bulliarda prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate bulliarda, is a low-growing flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular, violet-blue flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its compact growth habit, it is often used as a ground cover in xeriscaping.</p>
