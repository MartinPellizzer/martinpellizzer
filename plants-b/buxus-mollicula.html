                    <h1>Buxus mollicula</h1>
<p>Buxus mollicula, commonly known as the velvet boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that are slightly hairy beneath, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for hedges and topiary.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, Buxus mollicula is widely cultivated in gardens and landscapes.</p>
