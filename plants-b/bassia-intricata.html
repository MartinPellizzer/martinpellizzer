                    <h1>Bassia intricata</h1>
<p>Bassia intricata, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual or biennial herb with hairy, succulent stems that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to minimize water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Bassia intricata plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or dry habitats.</p>
