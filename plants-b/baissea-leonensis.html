<p>Baissea leonensis, commonly known as the Leon's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Baissea leonensis plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for various animals and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>
