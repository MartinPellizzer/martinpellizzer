                    <h1>Buxus pubiramea</h1>
<p>Buxus pubiramea, commonly known as the woolly boxwood, is a species of evergreen shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage that is covered with fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are small, oval, and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its arid environment. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers followed by small, red berries that are edible for some bird species.</p>
<p>This plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardy nature.</p>
