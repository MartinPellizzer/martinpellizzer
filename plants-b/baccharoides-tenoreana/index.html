                            <h1>Baccharoides Tenoreana</h1>
<p>Baccharoides tenoreana is a rare and fascinating plant native to the remote island of San Pietro in the Tuscan Archipelago. This small shrub is known for its striking silver-green foliage and delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas with high salinity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes. Conservation efforts are crucial to ensure the survival of this unique species.</p>
