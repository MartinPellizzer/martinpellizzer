                    <h1>Billbergia nutans f. rupestris</h1>
<p>Billbergia nutans f. rupestris, commonly known as the rock billbergia, is a compact bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, upright stems and dense rosettes of narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered in a powdery bloom. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, adding a vivid contrast to its foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is particularly valued for its compact size and ornamental appeal in both indoor and outdoor settings.</p>
