                    <h1>Betula × purpusii</h1>
<p>Betula × purpusii, commonly known as the hybrid birch, is a deciduous tree resulting from the cross between Betula pendula and Betula jacquemontii.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by small, triangular leaves that turn gold in the fall. It thrives in temperate climates and is often planted for ornamental purposes due to its graceful form and seasonal color changes.</p>
<p>Betula × purpusii is also valued for its ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions and its role in ecological restoration projects.</p>
