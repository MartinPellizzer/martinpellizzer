<p>Betula pendula subsp.</p>
<p>fontqueri, commonly known as the weeping birch, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its graceful, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by small, triangular leaves that turn golden in autumn. Its bark is smooth and white when young, developing into a flaky, darker texture as the tree matures.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks.</p>
