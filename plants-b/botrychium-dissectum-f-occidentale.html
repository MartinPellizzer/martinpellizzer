<p>Botrychium dissectum f. occidentale, commonly known as the western moonwort, is a fern-like fern that belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that resemble small, dissected leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-bearing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in a distinctive, umbrella-like arrangement on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is notable for its unique morphology and is often found in temperate regions of the western United States.</p>
