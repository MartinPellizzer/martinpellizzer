<p>Betula pubescens f. reticulata, commonly known as the silver birch variant with a reticulated bark, is a subspecies of the silver birch native to northern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, flaky, silver-gray bark that peels in a network-like pattern, giving it a unique appearance. The plant is a deciduous tree or shrub, typically reaching heights of 10 to 20 meters, with slender, pendulous branches. Its leaves are elliptical, serrated, and turn yellow in autumn, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>The flowers are catkins, with male and female flowers occurring on separate trees, and the tree produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
