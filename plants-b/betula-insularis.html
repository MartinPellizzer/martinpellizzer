                    <h1>Betula insularis</h1>
<p>Betula insularis, commonly known as the island birch, is a small deciduous tree native to the remote islands of the North Atlantic.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-trunked form and smooth, pale bark that peels in thin, papery strips. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated margins, turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to coastal environments and is often found growing on rocky or sandy soils.</p>
