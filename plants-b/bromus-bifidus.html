<p>Bromus bifidus, commonly known as the two-lobed brome, is a grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, with each spikelet containing two bracts that give it its common name. Bromus bifidus typically thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as meadows and roadsides.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals.</p>
