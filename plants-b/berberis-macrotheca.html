                    <h1>Berberis macrotheca</h1>
<p>Berberis macrotheca, commonly known as the broad-leaved barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, spiny stems and large, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is cultivated in some regions for both aesthetic and practical purposes.</p>
