<p>Baccharis sternbergiana, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which provides a striking visual contrast against its dark stems. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in compact clusters, typically blooming in the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and native plant gardens.</p>
