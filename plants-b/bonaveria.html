                    <h1>Bonaveria</h1>
<p>Bonaveria, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are often covered in a silvery or white powdery coating, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. Bonaveria species typically produce showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>These plants are often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to their striking foliage and vibrant blooms.</p>
