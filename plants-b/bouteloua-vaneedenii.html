<p>Bouteloua vaneedenii, commonly known as the Vaneedenâ€™s gramina, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Its flowers are typically wind-pollinated, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range.</p>
