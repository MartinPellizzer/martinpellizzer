<p>Berchemia cinerascens, commonly known as the silverleaf berchemia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and silver-gray in color, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Berchemia cinerascens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display.</p>
