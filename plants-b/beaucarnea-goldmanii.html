<p>Beaucarnea goldmanii, commonly known as the elephant tree, is a succulent plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, swollen, tree-like stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant has sparse, fibrous roots and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its leaves are modified into thick, fleshy structures that reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The species is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements.</p>
