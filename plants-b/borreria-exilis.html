<p>Borreria exilis, commonly known as the slender borreria, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant has succulent leaves that help it conserve water in its dry environment. Borreria exilis is often found growing in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in xerophytic plant biology.</p>
