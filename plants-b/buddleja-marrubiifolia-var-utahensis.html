                    <h1>Buddleja marrubiifolia var. utahensis</h1>
<p>Buddleja marrubiifolia var. utahensis, commonly known as the Utah bluebush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features compact, rounded growth with silvery-gray foliage that reflects sunlight and reduces water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, pale blue to lavender flowers that attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a fuzzy texture that aids in moisture retention.</p>
<p>This drought-tolerant species is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
