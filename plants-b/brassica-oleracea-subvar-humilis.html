                    <h1>Brassica oleracea subvar. humilis</h1>
<p>Brassica oleracea subvar. humilis, commonly known as wild cabbage, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, lobed leaves that are typically hairy. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which are followed by round, green pods containing seeds. It is a diploid species with a genome size typical of the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often considered a wild relative of cultivated cabbage and broccoli, contributing to genetic diversity in the genus.</p>
