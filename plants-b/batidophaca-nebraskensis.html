<p>Batidophaca nebraskensis, commonly known as the Nebraska batidophaca, is a rare flowering plant native to the tallgrass prairies of Nebraska.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, pale green leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
