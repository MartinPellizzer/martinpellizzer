<p>Botrychium virginianum subsp.</p>
<p>europaeum, commonly known as the European moonwort, is a small, delicate fern-like plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its unique fronds that resemble a cluster of small, green, shield-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions.</p>
