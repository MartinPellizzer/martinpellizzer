                    <h1>Bermudiana juncea var. normalis</h1>
<p>Bermudiana juncea var. normalis, commonly known as the Bermuda grass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of Bermuda.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green blades and tufted growth habit, which allows it to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant has a robust root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It is often used in lawns and pastures due to its drought tolerance and ability to recover quickly from wear.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly.</p>
