<p>Billbergia euphemiae, commonly known as the Euphemia Billbergia, is a species of bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's use. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. It produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
