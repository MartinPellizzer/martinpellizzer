                    <h1>Blechum blechum</h1>
<p>Blechum blechum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom only during specific periods of the year, typically in late winter or early spring. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in the arid mountain environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, Blechum blechum is considered a conservation concern.</p>
