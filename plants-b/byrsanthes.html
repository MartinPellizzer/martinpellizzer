<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and showy yellow or white flower heads. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The flowers are often borne in clusters at the ends of the stems, adding ornamental value to the plant.</p>
<p>Byrsanthes species are native to southern Africa and are adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils.</p>
