<p>Busipho ferox, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a hardy, deciduous tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and thick, gnarled bark that provides protection against fire and drought. The tree produces small, white flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It is highly valued for its durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions.</p>
