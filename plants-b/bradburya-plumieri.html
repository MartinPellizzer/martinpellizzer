<p>Bradburya plumieri, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white, spider-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It requires a specific combination of humidity, light, and air circulation to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and threats from habitat loss, Bradburya plumieri is considered endangered.</p>
