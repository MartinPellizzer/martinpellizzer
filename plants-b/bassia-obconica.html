<p>Bassia obconica, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Bassia obconica is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
