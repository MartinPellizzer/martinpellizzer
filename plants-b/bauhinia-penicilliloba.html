<p>Bauhinia penicilliloba, commonly known as the velvetwood or red bauhinia, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by flat, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. Bauhinia penicilliloba is adapted to dry climates and is often found in savannas and woodland areas.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant for soil enrichment in agricultural systems.</p>
