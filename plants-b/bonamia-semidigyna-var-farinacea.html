                    <h1>Bonamia semidigyna var. farinacea</h1>
<p>Bonamia semidigyna var. farinacea, commonly known as the sticky bonamia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glandular, sticky leaves that secrete a viscous substance, which can trap small insects. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The sticky secretions of this plant have been studied for their potential use in natural pest control.</p>
