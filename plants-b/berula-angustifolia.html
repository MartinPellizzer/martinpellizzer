                    <h1>Berula angustifolia</h1>
<p>Berula angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf watercress, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water, along the edges of ponds, streams, and ditches. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, with small white flowers that appear in early summer. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Berula angustifolia is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress.</p>
