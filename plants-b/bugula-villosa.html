                    <h1>Bugula villosa</h1>
<p>Bugula villosa, commonly known as the hairy bugula, is a species of marine bryozoan found in coastal waters.</p>
<p>It forms dense colonies that are often attached to substrates such as rocks or artificial structures. The colony is composed of many small, repeating units called zooids, each with a lophophore used for feeding. Its appearance is characterized by a soft, gelatinous texture with a fuzzy or hairy surface.</p>
<p>Bugula villosa plays a role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to benthic biodiversity.</p>
