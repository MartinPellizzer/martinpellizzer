                    <h1>Bucida spinosa</h1>
<p>Bucida spinosa, commonly known as the coral tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and clusters of small, bright red flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, round, woody fruits that contain several seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Bucida spinosa is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in coastal areas.</p>
