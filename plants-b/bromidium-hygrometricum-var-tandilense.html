                    <h1>Bromidium hygrometricum var. tandilense</h1>
<p>Bromidium hygrometricum var. tandilense, commonly known as the Tandil bromidium, is a rare and striking bromeliad native to Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence bearing small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
