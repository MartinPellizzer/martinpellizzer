<p>Bruguiera gymnorhiza f. alba, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a variant of the mangrove species native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments, and possesses specialized root systems that filter out excess salt. The plant has pneumatophores, which are aerial roots that facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. Its white flowers are typically small and clustered, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>This species plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and preventing erosion.</p>
