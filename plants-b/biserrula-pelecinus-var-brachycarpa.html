                    <h1>Biserrula pelecinus var. brachycarpa</h1>
<p>Biserrula pelecinus var. brachycarpa, commonly known as the short-seeded biserrula, is a leguminous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces pods that are shorter and more compact compared to the typical biserrula, hence the variety name. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy forage crop.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to fix nitrogen in the soil enhances its ecological and agricultural value.</p>
