                    <h1>Bufonia mauritanica var. longipetala</h1>
<p>Bufonia mauritanica var. longipetala, commonly known as the long-petioled desert bean, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub characterized by its woody stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits. Its adaptations to harsh environments include deep root systems and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>The species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for local wildlife.</p>
