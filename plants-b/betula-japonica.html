                    <h1>Betula japonica</h1>
<p>Betula japonica, commonly known as the Japanese birch, is a deciduous tree native to Japan and parts of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in the spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and oval-shaped, turning yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>Betula japonica is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine.</p>
