<p>Billbergia nobilis, commonly known as the pink bottlebrush, is a striking bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of broad, dark green, waxy leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant red or pink flower spikes that emerge from the center of the rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Billbergia nobilis is popular as a ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance.</p>
