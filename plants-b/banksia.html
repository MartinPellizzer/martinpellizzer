                    <h1>Banksia</h1>
<p>Banksia, commonly known as the Australian banksia, is a genus of about 170 species of shrubs and trees native to Australia.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their unique cylindrical or spiky flower heads, which are typically bright yellow or orange in color. The flowers are arranged in dense, cone-like structures called "globes" and are pollinated by birds, insects, and mammals. Banksias have tough, leathery leaves that help them survive in dry, sandy soils and harsh climates.</p>
<p>They play an important role in the ecosystems of Australia, providing food and habitat for native wildlife.</p>
