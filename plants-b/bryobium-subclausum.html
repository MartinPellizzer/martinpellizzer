                    <h1>Bryobium subclausum</h1>
<p>Bryobium subclausum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bryobium, is a rare and enigmatic liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, closely spaced, and often overlapping leaves that form dense, cushion-like growths. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are relatively simple and consist of a capsule that releases spores.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
