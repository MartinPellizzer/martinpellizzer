                    <h1>Balanophora cucphuongensis</h1>
<p>Balanophora cucphuongensis, commonly known as the Cuc Phuong ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species endemic to Vietnam.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant lacks chlorophyll and is therefore unable to perform photosynthesis, relying instead on its host for sustenance. It produces small, white flowers that are typically pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered critically endangered and is found primarily in the Cuc Phuong National Park.</p>
