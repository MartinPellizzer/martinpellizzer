<p>Balanophora elongata var. ungeriana, commonly known as the yellow sand orchid, is a terrestrial orchid with a unique parasitic lifestyle.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on fungal associations for nutrient uptake, making it a myco-heterotroph. The plant features a slender, branching stem covered in small, scale-like leaves. Its flowers are yellow and are arranged in a spike, typically blooming in spring.</p>
<p>It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in sandy soils of pine flatwoods and scrub habitats.</p>
