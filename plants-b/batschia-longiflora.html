                    <h1>Batschia longiflora</h1>
<p>Batschia longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered bat's shoe, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland areas, often in shaded or semi-shaded conditions. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of other umbelliferous plants, while its fruit is a dry, three-lobed achene.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Batschia longiflora is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
