                    <h1>Botrychium obliquum f. oneidense</h1>
<p>Botrychium obliquum f. oneidense, commonly known as the Oneida fern, is a rare fern species native to the northeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that are divided into two unequal parts, with the upper portion being more elongated. The plant produces sporangia in clusters called sorus, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and its role in ecological studies of fern diversity.</p>
