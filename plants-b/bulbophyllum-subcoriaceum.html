<p>Bulbophyllum subcoriaceum, commonly known as the rough-leaved orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a dense, fibrous layer, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a raceme, typically blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts.</p>
