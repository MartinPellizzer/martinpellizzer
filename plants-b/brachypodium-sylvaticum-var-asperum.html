                    <h1>Brachypodium sylvaticum var. asperum</h1>
<p>Brachypodium sylvaticum var. asperum, commonly known as rough brachypodium, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ecological importance, it is often used in ecological restoration and as a model organism in plant biology research.</p>
