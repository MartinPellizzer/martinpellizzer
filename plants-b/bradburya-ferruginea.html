                    <h1>Bradburya ferruginea</h1>
<p>Bradburya ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty bradburya, is a rare and unique plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a succulent with distinctive, fleshy, spiny leaves that are often covered in a reddish or rust-colored coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle beauty to its rugged appearance. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat needs, Bradburya ferruginea is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
