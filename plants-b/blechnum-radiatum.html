<p>Blechnum radiatum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery fronds that are covered in a fine, silvery coating of trichomes. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Blechnum radiatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has cultural significance in MƒÅori traditions.</p>
