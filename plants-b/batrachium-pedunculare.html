                    <h1>Batrachium pedunculare</h1>
<p>Batrachium pedunculare, commonly known as the spurred coralroot, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>This plant is a terrestrial orchid that lacks chlorophyll and is therefore dependent on mycorrhizal fungi for its nutrition. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a spike, which are often mistaken for mushrooms due to their shape and color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as pine forests and wetlands.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
