<p>Brachyachenium incanum, commonly known as the hairy grass or silvergrass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant is characterized by its short, dense inflorescence and silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its small, wind-dispersed seeds contribute to its ability to colonize disturbed or barren landscapes.</p>
<p>Brachyachenium incanum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range.</p>
