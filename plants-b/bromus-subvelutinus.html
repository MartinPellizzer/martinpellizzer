                    <h1>Bromus subvelutinus</h1>
<p>Bromus subvelutinus, commonly known as the silky brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to dry meadows, grasslands, and disturbed sites, often forming dense clumps. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets, which are usually pale green to brown in color.</p>
<p>Bromus subvelutinus is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in restoration ecology projects.</p>
