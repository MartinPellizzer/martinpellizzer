                    <h1>Brachypodium ramosum var. scabriculme</h1>
<p>Brachypodium ramosum var. scabriculme, commonly known as the rough-leaved brachypodium, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense,丛生 growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are rough to the touch due to the presence of stiff hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ecological role in supporting insect and bird populations in its native habitats.</p>
