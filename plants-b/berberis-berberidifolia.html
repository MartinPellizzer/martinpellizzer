                    <h1>Berberis berberidifolia</h1>
<p>Berberis berberidifolia, commonly known as the alpine barberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, evergreen leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and mammals. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates.</p>
