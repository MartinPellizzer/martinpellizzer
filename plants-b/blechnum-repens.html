<p>Blechnum repens, commonly known as the running shield fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread horizontally, forming dense mats of foliage. The fronds are typically lanceolate, with a leathery texture and a deep green color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to propagate vegetatively makes it a common sight in moist, humid habitats.</p>
