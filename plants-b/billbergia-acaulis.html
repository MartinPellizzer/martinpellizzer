                    <h1>Billbergia acaulis</h1>
<p>Billbergia acaulis, commonly known as the naked-stemmed billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central tank to collect water. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant orange or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Billbergia acaulis is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
