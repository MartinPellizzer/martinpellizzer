                    <h1>Baccharis subpingraea f. borealis</h1>
<p>Baccharis subpingraea f. borealis, commonly known as the northern baccharis, is a shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are aromatic and have a slightly fuzzy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to colder climates and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
