                    <h1>Botrychium lunaria</h1>
<p>Botrychium lunaria, commonly known as the moonwort, is a small, perennial fern that belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, bi-lobed fronds that resemble a crescent moon, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in a single, terminal structure called a sorus, which is distinctive in appearance.</p>
<p>Botrychium lunaria is often found in temperate regions and is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
