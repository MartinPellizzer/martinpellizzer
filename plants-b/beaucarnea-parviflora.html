<p>Beaucarnea parviflora, commonly known as the elephant's foot plant, is a succulent native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its swollen, tree-like base that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant has short, narrow leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces small, white flowers during the summer months.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening.</p>
