<p>Brassaia littorea, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which attract pollinators like bees and birds. Its roots are adapted to tolerate saltwater and can thrive in sandy or rocky soils near the shore.</p>
<p>Brassaia littorea is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
