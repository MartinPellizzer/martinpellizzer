                    <h1>Bromus mexicanus</h1>
<p>Bromus mexicanus, commonly known as Mexican brome, is a perennial grass native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender,丛生 (tufted) growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in arid environments.</p>
<p>Bromus mexicanus is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its aggressive growth and adaptability.</p>
