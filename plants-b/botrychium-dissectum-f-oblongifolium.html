                    <h1>Botrychium dissectum f. oblongifolium</h1>
<p>Botrychium dissectum f. oblongifolium, commonly known as the oblong-leafed moonwort, is a fern species characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Osmundaceae and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the undersides of its leaves. Its leaves are usually dissected, giving the plant a lacy appearance, and it often grows close to the ground.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in maintaining forest floor ecosystems.</p>
