                    <h1>Bromus racemosus var. gracilis</h1>
<p>Bromus racemosus var. gracilis, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed seeds. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions.</p>
