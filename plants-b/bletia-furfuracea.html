                    <h1>Bletia furfuracea</h1>
<p>Bletia furfuracea, commonly known as the woolly bletia, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropical forests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it its common name, and it typically grows in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often blooming during the rainy season. Bletia furfuracea is a pseudobulbous orchid, meaning it has thickened stems that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike.</p>
