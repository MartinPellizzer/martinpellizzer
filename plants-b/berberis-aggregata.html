                    <h1>Berberis aggregata</h1>
<p>Berberis aggregata, commonly known as the thorny barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features multiple stems covered in sharp, spiny thorns, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and some mammals. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a smooth margin and a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Berberis aggregata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits.</p>
