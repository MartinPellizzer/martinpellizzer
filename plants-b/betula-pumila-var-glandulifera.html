                    <h1>Betula pumila var. glandulifera</h1>
<p>Betula pumila var. glandulifera, commonly known as the sticky birch, is a small deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, oval leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and female flowers are borne on separate branches. Its unique feature is the presence of glandular hairs on the leaves and stems, which give it a sticky texture.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in moist, acidic soils and is an important species for wildlife habitat.</p>
