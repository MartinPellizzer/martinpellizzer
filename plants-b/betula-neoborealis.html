                    <h1>Betula neoborealis</h1>
<p>Betula neoborealis, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a deciduous tree native to northern regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in cold climates and is often found in boreal and subarctic forests.</p>
<p>Betula neoborealis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems.</p>
