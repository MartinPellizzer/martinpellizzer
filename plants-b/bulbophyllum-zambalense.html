                    <h1>Bulbophyllum zambalense</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum zambalense, commonly known as the Zambales orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is a small epiphytic orchid that thrives in tropical rainforest environments, typically growing on tree trunks or branches. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom during the rainy season. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive periods of drought.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in some regions.</p>
