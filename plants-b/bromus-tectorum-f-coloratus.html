                    <h1>Bromus tectorum f. coloratus</h1>
<p>Bromus tectorum f. coloratus, commonly known as the colored cheatgrass, is a variant of cheatgrass native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that forms dense mats and is often found in disturbed soils, such as those in sagebrush ecosystems. The plant is characterized by its striking purple or reddish coloration in its foliage and inflorescence, which distinguishes it from the typical green form. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth and ability to invade native plant communities, it is considered an invasive species in many regions.</p>
