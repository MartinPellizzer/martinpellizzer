                    <h1>Betula fontinalis</h1>
<p>Betula fontinalis, commonly known as the river birch, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive exfoliating bark that peels in thin, papery layers, revealing a pale yellow or reddish-brown inner bark. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and turn a vibrant yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>Betula fontinalis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along riverbanks and streamside habitats.</p>
