                    <h1>Boraginella calcarata</h1>
<p>Boraginella calcarata, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky, arid environments in southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, hairy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots help it anchor in crevices and access moisture from deep within the soil.</p>
<p>Boraginella calcarata is adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in its natural habitat.</p>
