<p>Bermudiana acris, commonly known as the Bermuda grass, is a perennial grass species native to the subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and a fibrous root system that allows it to thrive in a variety of soil types. The plant is drought-tolerant and often forms dense mats, making it a common invasive species in disturbed areas. Its ability to spread through rhizomes and tillers contributes to its resilience and widespread distribution.</p>
<p>Bermudiana acris is widely used for lawns, pastures, and erosion control due to its hardiness and adaptability.</p>
