                    <h1>Berberis floribunda</h1>
<p>Berberis floribunda, commonly known as the flowering barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and lance-shaped leaves that turn a striking orange-red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and hedges.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature and seasonal color changes make it a valuable addition to both landscape design and ecological habitats.</p>
