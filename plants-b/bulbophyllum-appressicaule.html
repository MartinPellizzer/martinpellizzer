                    <h1>Bulbophyllum appressicaule</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum appressicaule, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its pseudobulbs are short and thick, supporting the plant's survival in low-light conditions.</p>
<p>The flowers are usually short-lived, blooming briefly before withering, which is a common trait among many orchid species.</p>
