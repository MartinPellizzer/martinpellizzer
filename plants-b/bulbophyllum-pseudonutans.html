                    <h1>Bulbophyllum pseudonutans</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum pseudonutans, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and captivating orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of small, white, ghost-like flowers that bloom during the dry season. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a subject of both botanical interest and conservation concern.</p>
<p>Due to its fragility and limited natural range, it is highly susceptible to habitat loss and illegal collection.</p>
