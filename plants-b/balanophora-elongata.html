                    <h1>Balanophora elongata</h1>
<p>Balanophora elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed orchid, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the family Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of other plants. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and specialized growth habits, it is relatively rare and difficult to study in the wild.</p>
