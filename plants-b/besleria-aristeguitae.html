                    <h1>Besleria aristeguitae</h1>
<p>Besleria aristeguitae, commonly known as the Ecuadorian flame orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Epidendroideae subfamily and is characterized by its vibrant red and yellow flowers, which bloom in a spiral pattern along the inflorescence. The plant has fleshy, dark green leaves and produces pseudobulbs that store water, an adaptation to its humid, high-altitude habitat. It is highly sought after by botanists and horticulturists due to its unique appearance and limited distribution.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are crucial for its survival, as it faces threats from habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
