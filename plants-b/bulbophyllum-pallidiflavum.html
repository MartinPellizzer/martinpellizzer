                    <h1>Bulbophyllum pallidiflavum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum pallidiflavum, commonly known as the pale yellow orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in seasonal environments. The plant produces showy, yellow-green flowers with intricate patterns, often blooming in the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated by enthusiasts but is also threatened by habitat loss in the wild.</p>
