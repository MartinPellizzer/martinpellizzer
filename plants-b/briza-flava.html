<p>Briza flava, commonly known as the yellow quaking grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and delicate, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, marshes, and along stream banks, thriving in damp, well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Briza flava is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity.</p>
