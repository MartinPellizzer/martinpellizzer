<p>Bolbophyllopsis, commonly known as the club-leaf fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, club-shaped fronds that are often densely packed and covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Bolbophyllopsis species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
