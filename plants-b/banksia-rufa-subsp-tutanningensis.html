<p>Banksia rufa subsp.</p>
<p>tutanningensis, commonly known as the tutanningensis banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical or conical inflorescences, which are typically red or orange in color.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects, contributing to its ecological importance. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to fire-prone environments and can resprout from underground stems after bushfires.</p>
