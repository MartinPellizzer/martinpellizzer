<p>Bulbophyllum spadiciflorum, commonly known as the spike-flowered orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated inflorescence that bears numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in environments with seasonal dry periods.</p>
<p>The flowers are often pollinated by insects, contributing to its ecological role in tropical ecosystems.</p>
