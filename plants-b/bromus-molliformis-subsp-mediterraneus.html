<p>Bromus molliformis subsp.</p>
<p>mediterraneus, commonly known as the Mediterranean brome, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as rocky soils, grasslands, and along coastal areas.</p>
<p>The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it is well adapted to Mediterranean climates with mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
