                    <h1>Bunias prostrata</h1>
<p>Bunias prostrata, commonly known as creeping rocket, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, green, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in damp meadows or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread via seeds, it can become invasive in certain regions.</p>
