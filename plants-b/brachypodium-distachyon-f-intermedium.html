                    <h1>Brachypodium distachyon f. intermedium</h1>
<p>Brachypodium distachyon f. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate brachypodium, is a variant of the model grass species Brachypodium distachyon.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intermediate morphological traits between the typical annual and perennial forms of the species. This form exhibits a more robust growth habit and is often found in disturbed soils or grasslands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>It is valued in research for its genetic simplicity and potential applications in bioenergy and grassland ecology.</p>
