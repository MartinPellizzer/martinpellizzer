<p>Benzoin laureola, commonly known as the sacred tree or benjamin tree, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic resin, which is tapped from the bark and used in traditional medicine and incense. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by dark purple berries. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly waxy texture.</p>
<p>The botanical name reflects its association with the genus *Styrax*, which includes several species known for their resinous properties.</p>
