<p>Bulbophyllum levatii subsp.</p>
<p>mischanthum, commonly known as the Yellow Ghost Orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking yellow flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions.</p>
<p>The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in its humid, shaded forest habitats. Its flowers are typically short-lived, blooming briefly before withering, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this species is considered vulnerable and is often protected in conservation programs.</p>
