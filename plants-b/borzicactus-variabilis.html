<p>Borzicactus variabilis, commonly known as the variable borzicactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the base of the stem. It has a shallow root system adapted to absorb moisture from the soil after rare rainfalls.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range.</p>
