<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces showy, daisy-like flowers that are typically pale yellow to orange in color. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall.</p>
<p>Burrielia anthemoides is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
