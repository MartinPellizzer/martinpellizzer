<p>Bromopsis vogulica, commonly known as the Vogulian feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces delicate, feathery inflorescences that are often wind-pollinated. The plant thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments, typically found in tundra and alpine meadows. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a blue-green hue that helps it withstand harsh climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Bromopsis vogulica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range.</p>
