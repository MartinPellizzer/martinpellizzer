<p>Bruguiera obtusa, commonly known as the mangrove apple or red mangrove, is a tropical tree species native to the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its salt-excreting leaves and specialized root systems that help it thrive in brackish water environments. The plant has pneumatophores, which are aerial roots that facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. Its flowers are small and clustered, and it produces edible berries that are an important food source for various wildlife.</p>
<p>Bruguiera obtusa plays a crucial role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for marine and terrestrial species.</p>
