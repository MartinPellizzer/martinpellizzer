<p>Berberis pinnata subsp.</p>
<p>insularis, commonly known as the island barberry, is a shrub native to the Caribbean islands. It features slender, spiny stems and alternate, pinnate leaves with serrated edges.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, often found in coastal and forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>
