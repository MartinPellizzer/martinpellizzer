<p>Bromus inermis var. glaber, commonly known as smooth brome, is a perennial grass native to Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in panicles, with small, wind-pollinated florets. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, fertile ground.</p>
<p>Smooth brome is often used in forage and erosion control due to its hardiness and adaptability.</p>
