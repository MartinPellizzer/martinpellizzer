                    <h1>Baissea subsessilis</h1>
<p>Baissea subsessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved baissea, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
