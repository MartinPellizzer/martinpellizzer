                    <h1>Baccharis elegans</h1>
<p>Baccharis elegans, commonly known as brittle bush, is a shrub native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands make it an important component of chaparral and coastal sage scrub ecosystems.</p>
