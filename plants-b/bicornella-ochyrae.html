<p>Bicornella ochyrae, commonly known as the red-tailed ant plant, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red-tipped leaves and its ability to form symbiotic relationships with ants. The plant's morphology includes a dense mat of leaf-like structures that provide shelter for its ant inhabitants. Its botanical significance lies in its specialized adaptations for nutrient acquisition in canopy environments.</p>
<p>Bicornella ochyrae is also notable for its role in ecological interactions within its native habitat.</p>
