<p>Bassia symoniana, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in desert and semi-desert environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates.</p>
