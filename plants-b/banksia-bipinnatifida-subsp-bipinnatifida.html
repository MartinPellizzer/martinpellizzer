<p>Banksia bipinnatifida subsp.</p>
<p>bipinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to south-western Australia. It is characterized by its long, narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces dense, cylindrical flower spikes that are typically yellow or orange in color, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody cone-like structures, called follicles, contain seeds that are released after fire, aiding in regeneration.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat.</p>
