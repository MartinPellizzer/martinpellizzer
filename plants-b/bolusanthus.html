<p>Bolusanthus, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a genus of flowering plants native to Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its milky sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation.

Bolusanthus species are often found in arid or semi-arid regions and are adapted to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>They are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though their toxic properties limit their practical applications.</p>
