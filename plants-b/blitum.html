<p>Blitum, commonly known as bladder campion, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their distinctive bladder-like structures on their stems, which are actually specialized leaves called phyllodes. Blitum species are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, where they thrive in sandy or rocky soils. They produce small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to white, often blooming in spring or early summer.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Blitum violaceum and Blitum capillaris, which are sometimes used in herbal medicine.</p>
