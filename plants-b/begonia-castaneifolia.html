                    <h1>Begonia castaneifolia</h1>
<p>Begonia castaneifolia, commonly known as the chestnut-leaf begonia, is a tropical perennial plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that resemble chestnuts, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings.</p>
