                    <h1>Baccharis collina</h1>
<p>Baccharis collina, commonly known as coast wick, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty, windy environments.</p>
<p>Baccharis collina plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
