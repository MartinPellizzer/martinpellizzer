                    <h1>Barringtonia eberhardtii</h1>
<p>Barringtonia eberhardtii, commonly known as the white cedar, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking white, pendulous flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant produces a large, woody capsule that splits open to release its seeds, often dispersed by wind. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in humid environments.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities.</p>
