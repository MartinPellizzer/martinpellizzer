                    <h1>Bromus erectus var. condensatus</h1>
<p>Bromus erectus var. condensatus, commonly known as the dense brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, open woodlands, and along roadsides. The plant has slender,丛生 (clumped) growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the stems. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is adapted to survive in arid environments.</p>
<p>The species is sometimes considered an invasive plant in certain regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
