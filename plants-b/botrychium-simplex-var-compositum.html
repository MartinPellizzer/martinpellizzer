                    <h1>Botrychium simplex var. compositum</h1>
<p>Botrychium simplex var. compositum, commonly known as the composite moonwort, is a fern-like fern with distinctive botanical features.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae and is characterized by its unique, segmented fronds that resemble a fern but lack true fern-like structures. The plant has a short, underground rhizome with a single, erect, leaf-like structure called a sorus, which bears sporangia. It is typically found in moist, shaded habitats across North America.</p>
<p>Its morphology reflects a primitive evolutionary lineage, making it an important subject in the study of plant phylogeny.</p>
