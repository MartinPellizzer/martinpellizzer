<p>Balduina lutea, commonly known as the yellow sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Balduina lutea is adapted to withstand high temperatures and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh climates.</p>
