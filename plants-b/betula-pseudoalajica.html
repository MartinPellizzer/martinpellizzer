<p>Betula pseudoalajica, commonly known as the Andean birch, is a species of deciduous tree native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, white bark and slender, often pendulous branches. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the autumn. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>This plant is adapted to cold, mountainous environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat.</p>
