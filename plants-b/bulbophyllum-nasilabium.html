<p>Bulbophyllum nasilabium, commonly known as the "Lipless Orchid," is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with a unique growth habit, featuring a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with a distinctive lip that lacks the typical nectar-producing structures found in many orchids. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish-white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
