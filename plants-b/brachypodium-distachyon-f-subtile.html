                    <h1>Brachypodium distachyon f. subtile</h1>
<p>Brachypodium distachyon f. subtile, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. This variety is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. Botanically, it has a short stature, typically reaching heights of 10â€“30 cm, with spikelets that are closely arranged along the stem.</p>
<p>Its genome has been studied for its use in plant biology research due to its genetic simplicity and rapid life cycle.</p>
