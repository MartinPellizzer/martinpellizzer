                    <h1>Billbergia macracantha</h1>
<p>Billbergia macracantha, commonly known as the giant billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, rosette-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in height, forming a central cup that collects rainwater. The plant produces vibrant red flowers that bloom in clusters at the top of the leaf rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its dramatic appearance, it is often used as a dramatic focal point in tropical gardens and indoor collections.</p>
