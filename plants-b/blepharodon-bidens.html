<p>Blepharodon bidens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It possesses small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest aquatic invertebrates. The plant has slender, branching stems with whorled leaves that are often submerged in water. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it blooms during the summer months.</p>
<p>Blepharodon bidens is adapted to nutrient-poor environments, relying on its unique trapping mechanism for essential nutrients.</p>
