<p>Bourreria litoralis, commonly known as the coastal burrbean, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive, spiny fruits. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Bourreria litoralis plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides habitat for various small organisms.</p>
