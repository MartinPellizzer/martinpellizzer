                    <h1>Bubonium intermedium</h1>
<p>Bubonium intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate bubon, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and distinctive blue-violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
