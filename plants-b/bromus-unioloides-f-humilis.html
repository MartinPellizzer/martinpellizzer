                    <h1>Bromus unioloides f. humilis</h1>
<p>Bromus unioloides f. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf brome, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths close to the ground, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soils. Its flowering period usually occurs in late spring to early summer, producing pale green to brown spikelets.</p>
<p>Bromus unioloides f. humilis is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides, fields, and open woodlands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
