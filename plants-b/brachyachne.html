                    <h1>Brachyachne</h1>
<p>Brachyachne, commonly known as the shortgrass or dwarf grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, where they thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Brachyachne species are characterized by their compact growth habit and small, narrow leaves. They produce small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often clustered at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Due to their drought tolerance, they play an important role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in harsh environments.</p>
