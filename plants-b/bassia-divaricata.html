                    <h1>Bassia divaricata</h1>
<p>Bassia divaricata, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with a mat-forming habit, characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptations to drought include thick, waxy leaves and a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Bassia divaricata is often used in xeriscaping due to its ability to thrive with minimal water and maintenance.</p>
