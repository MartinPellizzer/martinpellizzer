<p>Bromus ciliatus var. incanus, commonly known as the hairy brome, is a perennial grass native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its slender,丛生 (tufted) growth habit and its narrow, hairy leaves that give it its common name.
