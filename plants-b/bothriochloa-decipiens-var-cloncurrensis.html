                    <h1>Bothriochloa decipiens var. cloncurrensis</h1>
<p>Bothriochloa decipiens var. cloncurrensis, commonly known as the creeping hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and its dense, fibrous roots that help stabilize soil. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive silver-gray coloration due to fine pubescence. It produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its erosion-control capabilities.</p>
