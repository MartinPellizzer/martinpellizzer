                    <h1>Bancalus cuspidatus</h1>
<p>Bancalus cuspidatus, commonly known as the black-lung beetle, is a species of scarab beetle native to various regions in Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy black body and elongated, robust form, which is well adapted for burrowing. The plant associations of Bancalus cuspidatus are primarily with decaying organic matter, as it often inhabits moist environments rich in decomposing vegetation. Its larvae feed on organic debris, contributing to nutrient cycling in the soil.</p>
<p>This beetle plays a role in the decomposition process, aiding in the breakdown of plant material in its habitat.</p>
