                    <h1>Begonia nymphaeifolia</h1>
<p>Begonia nymphaeifolia, commonly known as the water begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy, water-repellent coating, which helps it thrive in humid environments. The plant produces delicate, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, white, and red, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a popular choice for aquatic and bog gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, Begonia nymphaeifolia is widely cultivated in both indoor and outdoor settings.</p>
