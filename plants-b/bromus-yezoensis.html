<p>Bromus yezoensis, commonly known as Yezo grass, is a perennial grass species native to East Asia, particularly Japan and parts of Russia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairless blades that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the stem, with small, two-lobed glumes and three to five bisexual florets. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Bromus yezoensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover in suitable environments.</p>
