                    <h1>Borellia</h1>
<p>Borellia, commonly known as the lichen-forming genus, is a group of fungi that form symbiotic relationships with algae or cyanobacteria.</p>
<p>These organisms are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Borellia species are characterized by their slow growth and intricate thallus structures. They play an important role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in their ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to their specialized habitats, many Borellia species are sensitive to environmental changes and are indicators of ecological health.</p>
