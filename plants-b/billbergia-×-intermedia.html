                    <h1>Billbergia × intermedia</h1>
<p>Billbergia × intermedia, commonly known as the hybrid billbergia, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Billbergia natalensis and Billbergia recurvata.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to South America, particularly Brazil. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often variegated with silver or white markings. It produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees.</p>
<p>Billbergia × intermedia is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its relatively low maintenance and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light.</p>
