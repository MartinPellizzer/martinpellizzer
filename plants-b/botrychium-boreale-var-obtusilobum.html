                    <h1>Botrychium boreale var. obtusilobum</h1>
<p>Botrychium boreale var. obtusilobum, commonly known as the broad-lobed moonwort, is a fern species native to northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, small, and delicate fronds that resemble a cluster of small, rounded leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its spore-producing structures, called sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its broad, rounded leaf lobes, which set it apart from other similar species within the Botrychium genus.</p>
