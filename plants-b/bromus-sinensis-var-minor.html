<p>Bromus sinensis var. minor, commonly known as the lesser Chinese brome, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high elevations, where it forms dense, low-growing tufts. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant characteristics.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in alpine environments.</p>
