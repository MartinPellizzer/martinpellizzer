                    <h1>Bovonia</h1>
<p>Bovonia, commonly known as the cow's horn plant, is a rare and unusual species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, horn-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a subtle aesthetic to its foliage. Bovonia thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
