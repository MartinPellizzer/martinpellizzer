                    <h1>Blotiella stipitata</h1>
<p>Blotiella stipitata, commonly known as the cushion bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it thrive in shallow, still water environments. The plant produces tiny, bladder-like structures that aid in trapping small aquatic organisms, contributing to its role as a predator in its ecosystem. It typically grows in freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches.</p>
<p>Its simple morphology and specialized adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
