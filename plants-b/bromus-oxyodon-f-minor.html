                    <h1>Bromus oxyodon f. minor</h1>
<p>Bromus oxyodon f. minor, commonly known as the narrow-leaved brome, is a grass species characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and meadows, preferring well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its foliage is often mistaken for other grasses due to its simple structure and lack of showy flowers.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to temperate climates and is often found in regions with moderate rainfall.</p>
