                    <h1>Becium fimbriatum var. angustilanceolatum</h1>
<p>Becium fimbriatum var. angustilanceolatum, commonly known as the narrow-lanceolate becium, is a rare and lesser-known plant species within the Fabaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pale yellow or greenish in color, which bloom during the spring and early summer. It thrives in specific microhabitats, often found in rocky or limestone-rich soils in Mediterranean climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
