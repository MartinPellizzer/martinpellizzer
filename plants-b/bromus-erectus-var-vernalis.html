<p>Bromus erectus var. vernalis, commonly known as spring brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>

The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 60 cm in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a single, slender spikelet that blooms in early spring.</p>
