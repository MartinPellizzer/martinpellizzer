                    <h1>Botryolotus</h1>
<p>Botryolotus, commonly known as the "bottle tree," is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their thick, swollen trunks that store water, allowing them to survive in arid environments. The leaves are typically small and arranged in a rosette pattern, reducing water loss through transpiration. Botryolotus species produce showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to red, attracting pollinators like bees and birds.</p>
<p>They are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their unique appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
