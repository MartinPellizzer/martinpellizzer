<p>Bromus sclerophyllus, commonly known as the hard-leaved brome, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, rigid leaves and compact growth habit, which help it survive in dry, rocky environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny seeds. Bromus sclerophyllus is often found in open habitats such as shrublands and grasslands.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
