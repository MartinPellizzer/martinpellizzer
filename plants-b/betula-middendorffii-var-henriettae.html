<p>Betula middendorffii var. henriettae, commonly known as the Henrietta's birch, is a rare variant of the white birch native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping form and striking white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are triangular with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall, adding to its ornamental value. It prefers cool, moist climates and is often found in subalpine or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
