                    <h1>Bromus ventolana</h1>
<p>Bromus ventolana, commonly known as the alpine brome, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous narrow, awned lemmas. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize open, disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Bromus ventolana is adapted to cold climates and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations.</p>
