<p>Bulbophyllum pallens, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale, ghostly appearance, with white or pale green flowers that resemble a ghostly figure. The plant lacks leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species in many regions.</p>
