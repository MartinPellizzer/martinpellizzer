                    <h1>Bursaria calcicola</h1>
<p>Bursaria calcicola, commonly known as the limestone burr bush, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Bursaria calcicola is adapted to calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
