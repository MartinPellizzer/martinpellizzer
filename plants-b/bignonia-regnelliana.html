                    <h1>Bignonia regnelliana</h1>
<p>Bignonia regnelliana, commonly known as the golden trumpet vine, is a deciduous climbing plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features showy, orange-yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves and produces long, slender seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
<p>However, it can be invasive in some regions due to its vigorous growth and ability to spread through seeds and root sprouts.</p>
