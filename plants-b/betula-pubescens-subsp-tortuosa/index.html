<p>Black birch, scientifically known as Betula pubescens subsp. tortuosa, is a resilient tree native to the northern regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in boreal and temperate forests. The tree is distinguished by its dark bark and clusters of small, yellowish-green catkins. Its wood is valued for its strength and is used in various crafts and industries. Despite its hardy nature, the black birch plays a vital role in supporting local ecosystems and wildlife.</p>
