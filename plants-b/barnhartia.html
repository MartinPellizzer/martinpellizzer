<p>Barnhartia, commonly known as the mountain daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. The plants typically have a rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produce showy yellow or orange flower heads. Barnhartia species are often found in high-altitude environments, where they thrive in cool, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Their unique morphology and ecological adaptations make them an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
