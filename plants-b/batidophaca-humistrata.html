<p>Batidophaca humistrata, commonly known as the swamp mistflower, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in tropical regions.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Batidophaca humistrata plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various small organisms.</p>
