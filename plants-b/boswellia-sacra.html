                    <h1>Boswellia sacra</h1>
<p>Boswellia sacra, commonly known as frankincense, is a small evergreen tree native to the Arabian Peninsula and the Horn of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green leaves and yellowish bark, which exude a fragrant resin when wounded. The resin, known as frankincense, is harvested from the tree's inner bark and has been used for centuries in religious and medicinal practices. Boswellia sacra thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, often growing in rocky or mountainous terrain.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique chemical composition, which includes boswellic acids, known for their anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
