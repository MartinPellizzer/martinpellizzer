                    <h1>Betula obovata</h1>
<p>Betula obovata, commonly known as the Japanese white birch, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are ovate to obovate in shape, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well adapted to temperate climates.</p>
