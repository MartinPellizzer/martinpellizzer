<p>Botrychium brevifolium, commonly known as the short-leaved moonwort, is a small, fern-like plant belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on specialized stalks, which are often clustered at the base of the fronds. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Botrychium brevifolium is a rare and ancient species, with a primitive morphology that reflects its evolutionary history.</p>
