<p>Bidens mollifolia var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth beggar's ticks, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features slender, hairy stems and alternate leaves that are usually lance-shaped with serrated edges. Its flowers are yellow with dark central disks, and it produces small, dry fruits called achenes.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its smoother, less hairy appearance compared to the typical Bidens mollifolia.</p>
