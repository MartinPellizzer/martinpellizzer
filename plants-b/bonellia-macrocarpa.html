                    <h1>Bonellia macrocarpa</h1>
<p>Bonellia macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater environments in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant's roots are often submerged, and it thrives in nutrient-poor waters. Its leaves are slender and adapted for efficient water movement.</p>
<p>Bonellia macrocarpa plays a unique ecological role by supplementing its nutrient intake through prey capture.</p>
