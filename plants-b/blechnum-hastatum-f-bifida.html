<p>Blechnum hastatum f. bifida, commonly known as the bifid maidenhair fern, is a rare and distinctive variant of the maidenhair fern family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that often split into two distinct lobes, giving it its common name. The plant features a creeping rhizome with clusters of small, spore-producing structures called sori. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
