                    <h1>Bonafousia rupicola var. versicolor</h1>
<p>Bonafousia rupicola var. versicolor, commonly known as the variable rock lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits a wide range of color variations in its thallus.</p>
<p>It typically grows on rocky substrates in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in regions with low humidity and high sunlight exposure. The plant's thallus is usually crustose or foliose, with a dense, compact structure that allows it to adhere firmly to its substrate. Its coloration can range from yellow to orange, red, or even green, depending on environmental conditions and the specific pigments present.</p>
<p>This variability makes it an interesting subject for studying lichen adaptation and ecological responses.</p>
