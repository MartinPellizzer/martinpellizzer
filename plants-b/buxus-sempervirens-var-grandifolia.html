                    <h1>Buxus sempervirens var. grandifolia</h1>
<p>Buxus sempervirens var. grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaved boxwood, is a compact evergreen shrub native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage, with leaves that are larger and more elongated compared to the typical boxwood. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for hedges and topiary.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and adaptability make it a favored plant in formal garden designs.</p>
