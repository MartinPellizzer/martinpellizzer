                    <h1>Bucephalophora aculeata</h1>
<p>Bucephalophora aculeata, commonly known as the spiny pteridium, is a member of the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny fronds.</p>
<p>It is a fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces fiddlehead-like young fronds that unfurl into lanceolate, serrated leaves. Its spores are released from sporangia located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it a notable species in the study of fern morphology and ecological adaptation.</p>
