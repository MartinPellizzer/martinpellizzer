<p>Brachycorythis conica subsp.</p>
<p>conica, commonly known as the narrow-leafed cycad, is a unique cycad species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and a crown of pinnate, dark green leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant.</p>
