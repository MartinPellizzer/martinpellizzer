<p>Blepharis procurrens, commonly known as the narrowleaf pearlytail, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that are clustered in racemes, giving it a delicate appearance. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Blepharis procurrens is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
