                    <h1>Bromus tectorum var. anisantha</h1>
<p>Bromus tectorum var. anisantha, commonly known as cheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to Eurasia but now widely invasive in North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in disturbed soils and is characterized by its rapid growth and early flowering, which allows it to outcompete native vegetation. The plant has slender, tufted leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that release lightweight seeds easily dispersed by wind. Its shallow root system makes it highly resilient to drought and fire, contributing to its ecological dominance in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>This invasive species significantly alters ecosystem dynamics by reducing biodiversity and increasing fire frequency in its invaded habitats.</p>
