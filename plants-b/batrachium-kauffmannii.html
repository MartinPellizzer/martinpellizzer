<p>Batrachium kauffmannii, commonly known as the Mexican ghostplant, is a rare aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its unique, translucent, and often ghostly appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters and has a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in muddy substrates. Its leaves are usually narrow and elongated, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention.</p>
<p>Batrachium kauffmannii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration.</p>
