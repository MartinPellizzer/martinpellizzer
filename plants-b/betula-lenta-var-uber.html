<p>Betula lenta var. uber, commonly known as the sweet birch, is a variant of the cherry birch native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, aromatic bark that emits a pleasant wintergreen scent when scratched. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins and oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The wood is hard and durable, historically used for furniture and tool handles.</p>
