<p>Biarum tenuifolium var. zelebori is a rare and striking plant native to southern Africa. Known for its elegant, bell-shaped flowers and dark green foliage, it is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family. This variant is particularly prized for its unique coloration and compact growth habit. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate sunlight to flourish. Due to its limited distribution, it is often sought after by collectors and botanists alike.</p>
