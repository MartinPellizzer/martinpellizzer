                    <h1>Bulbophyllum finisterrae</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum finisterrae, commonly known as the Atlantic Islands orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It possesses a unique morphology with a short, thick rhizome and a single, fleshy pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients. The plant produces a single spike with several pale yellow to greenish-white flowers, which are often fragrant. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the specific microclimate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
