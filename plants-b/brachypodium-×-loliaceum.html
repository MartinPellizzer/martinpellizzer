                    <h1>Brachypodium × loliaceum</h1>
<p>Brachypodium × loliaceum, commonly known as the intermediate brachypodium, is a hybrid grass species that results from the cross between Brachypodium distachyon and Brachypodium sylvaticum.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. Brachypodium × loliaceum is often used in ecological and agricultural studies due to its adaptability and genetic tractability.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable model organism for research on plant biology and climate resilience.</p>
