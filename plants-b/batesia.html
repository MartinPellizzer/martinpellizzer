<p>Batesia, commonly known as the genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae, consists of several species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their simple, opposite leaves and showy, clustered flowers. The flowers are usually small and tubular, often with four or five petals, and come in a range of colors including white, yellow, and red. Batesia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
