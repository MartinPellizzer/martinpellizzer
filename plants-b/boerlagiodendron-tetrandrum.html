<p>Boerlagiodendron tetrandrum, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by oval, woody fruits containing seeds.</p>
<p>It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction, though its conservation status is of concern due to overharvesting.</p>
