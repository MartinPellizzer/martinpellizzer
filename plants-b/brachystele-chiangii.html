                    <h1>Brachystele chiangii</h1>
<p>Brachystele chiangii, commonly known as the Chiang Mai stiltroot, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of northern Thailand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive stilt roots, which provide structural support and aid in nutrient absorption from the rocky substrates it inhabits. The plant belongs to the family Ericaceae and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Its small, evergreen leaves and clustered flowers make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
