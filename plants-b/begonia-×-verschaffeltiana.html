<p>Begonia × verschaffeltiana, commonly known as the hybrid begonia, is a popular ornamental plant prized for its vibrant, showy flowers.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Begonia semperflorens and Begonia pendula, combining the best traits of both parents. The plant typically features upright stems with large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. Its flowers come in a variety of colors, including red, pink, and white, and are borne in clusters at the ends of the stems.</p>
<p>This hybrid is well-suited for container gardening and is often used in hanging baskets due to its trailing growth habit.</p>
