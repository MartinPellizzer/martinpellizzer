                    <h1>Billardiera brachyantha var. phyllocalyx</h1>
<p>Billardiera brachyantha var. phyllocalyx, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It has small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 2 cm in length and are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, fleshy, red berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rainforests or on the trunks of eucalyptus trees.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature allows it to derive some of its nutrients from host plants, while still performing photosynthesis.</p>
