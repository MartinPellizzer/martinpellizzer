<p>Becium coddii, commonly known as the Codd's becium, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, preferring arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, yellowish flowers are arranged in clusters, and it produces a distinctive seed head that aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Becium coddii is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
