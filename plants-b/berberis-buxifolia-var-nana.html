<p>Berberis buxifolia var. nana, commonly known as dwarf boxleaf barberry, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It features dense, dark green foliage with a leathery texture, and its leaves are elliptical with a rounded base. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red-orange berries that are edible but often used for ornamental purposes. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and evergreen nature make it an attractive addition to small spaces.</p>
