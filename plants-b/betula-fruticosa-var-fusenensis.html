                    <h1>Betula fruticosa var. fusenensis</h1>
<p>Betula fruticosa var. fusenensis, commonly known as the Siberian dwarf birch, is a shrub-like species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of yellowish-white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to permafrost conditions, allowing it to thrive in harsh, cold climates. Its bark is smooth and often peels in thin layers, and it produces small, winged seeds for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic wildlife.</p>
