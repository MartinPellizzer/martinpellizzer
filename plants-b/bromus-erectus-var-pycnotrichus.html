                    <h1>Bromus erectus var. pycnotrichus</h1>
<p>Bromus erectus var. pycnotrichus, commonly known as the hairy brome, is a perennial grass species native to Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields. It produces spikelets that are often clustered in dense panicles, with awned lemmas that aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its adaptability to a range of soil types and its role in stabilizing soil in semi-arid environments.</p>
