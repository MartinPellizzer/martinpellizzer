                    <h1>Bothriochloa spicigera</h1>
<p>Bothriochloa spicigera, commonly known as spear grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open woodlands, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves with a distinctive ridge along the midrib, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a compact, spikelike structure. It produces small, two-lobed seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its wide distribution.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in erosion control and as a forage plant in some regions.</p>
