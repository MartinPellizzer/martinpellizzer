<p>Bulbophyllum sikapingense, commonly known as the Sikaping orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces small, greenish-white or pale yellow blooms that are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
