                    <h1>Biarum rhopalospadix</h1>
<p>Biarum rhopalospadix, commonly known as the slender spadix bellflower, is a rare and endangered species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated spadix that bears small, clustered flowers, typical of the Araceae family. The plant has heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in rich woodland soils.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
