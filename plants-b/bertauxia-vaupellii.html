                    <h1>Bertauxia vaupellii</h1>
<p>Bertauxia vaupellii, commonly known as the silverleaf lichen, is a unique foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green to silver-gray thallus, which is covered in a fine, powdery layer of soredia. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with specific cyanobacteria, which contribute to its ability to photosynthesize. It is often found on bark, stone, or soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature, it is sensitive to environmental changes and is considered an indicator species for air quality.</p>
