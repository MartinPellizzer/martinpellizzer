                    <h1>Botryopleuron venosum</h1>
<p>Botryopleuron venosum, commonly known as the veined bladderwort, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually thin and ribbon-like, with a distinctive network of veins.</p>
<p>Botryopleuron venosum is a carnivorous plant, relying on the trapped prey for additional nutrients in nutrient-poor waters.</p>
