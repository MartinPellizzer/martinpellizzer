                    <h1>Bupleurum sparsum</h1>
<p>Bupleurum sparsum, commonly known as slender bupleurum, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky soils and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by small, dry fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in dry grasslands and along the edges of shrublands, where it contributes to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
