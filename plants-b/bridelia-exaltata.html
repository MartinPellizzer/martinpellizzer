                    <h1>Bridelia exaltata</h1>
<p>Bridelia exaltata, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers followed by orange or red berries, which contain small, hard seeds. Bridelia exaltata is valued for its durable wood, which has been historically used in traditional crafts and construction.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in many parts of its range.</p>
