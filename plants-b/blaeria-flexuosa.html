<p>Blaeria flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible blazer, is a herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that often form a dense mat on the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, giving them a soft texture.</p>
<p>Blaeria flexuosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments.</p>
