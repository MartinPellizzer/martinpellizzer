                    <h1>Bulnesia chilensis</h1>
<p>Bulnesia chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean ironwood, is a slow-growing evergreen tree native to coastal regions of southern Chile and western Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and thick, fissured bark that provides protection against harsh coastal conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes.</p>
