                    <h1>Bromelia humilis var. hemisphaerica</h1>
<p>Bromelia humilis var. hemisphaerica, commonly known as the dwarf bromeliad, is a compact, evergreen plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's use. The leaves are typically green with a waxy texture, and the plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance.</p>
