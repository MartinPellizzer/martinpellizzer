<p>Boschniakia kawakamii, commonly known as the Kawakami's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without being parasitic. Its flowers are typically pale pink or white, with intricate, delicate structures that attract specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
