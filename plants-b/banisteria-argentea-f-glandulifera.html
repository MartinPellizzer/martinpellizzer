<p>Banisteria argentea f. glandulifera, commonly known as the silver banisteria, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, waxy hairs. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a yellow throat. Its stems are woody and can become quite long, making it suitable for trellises or arbors.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its glandular structures on the leaves, which give it the specific epithet *glandulifera*.</p>
