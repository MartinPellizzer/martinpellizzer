<p>Begonia xerophyta, commonly known as the sand begonia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping in dry climates.</p>
