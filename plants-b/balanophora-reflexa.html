                    <h1>Balanophora reflexa</h1>
<p>Balanophora reflexa, commonly known as the slender ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a mycoheterotrophic species, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are typically arranged in a spike-like cluster. Its roots are specialized for forming symbiotic relationships with specific fungi, which provide the plant with essential nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and habitat specificity, Balanophora reflexa is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
