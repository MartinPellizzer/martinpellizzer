                    <h1>Bromus scoparius</h1>
<p>Bromus scoparius, commonly known as the prickly barnyard grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can become a weed in cultivated lands.</p>
