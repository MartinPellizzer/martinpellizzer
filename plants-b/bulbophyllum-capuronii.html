                    <h1>Bulbophyllum capuronii</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum capuronii, commonly known as the Capuron's orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a lithophytic orchid, meaning it typically grows on rock surfaces, often in humid tropical environments. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are usually yellow or orange with intricate patterns. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with limited soil.</p>
<p>Bulbophyllum capuronii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts.</p>
