                    <h1>Bigelowia spathulata</h1>
<p>Bigelowia spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leafed bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features upright, branched stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of blue or purple. The leaves are broad and ovate, with a slightly hairy surface, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly seen in its natural environment.</p>
