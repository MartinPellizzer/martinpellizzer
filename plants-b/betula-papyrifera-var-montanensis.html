                    <h1>Betula papyrifera var. montanensis</h1>
<p>Betula papyrifera var. montanensis, commonly known as the mountain paper birch, is a variant of the paper birch native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a pinkish inner layer, which gives it its common name. The tree typically grows in cold, high-altitude environments, often in coniferous forests or open areas with well-drained soils. Its leaves are triangular with doubly serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to harsh climates and plays a significant role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
