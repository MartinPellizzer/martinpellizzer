                            <h1>Brassica Viminea</h1>
<p>Cabbage mustard, scientifically known as Brassica viminea, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth pattern and vibrant green leaves that are often tinged with purple. This plant belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known species such as cabbage and broccoli. Cabbage mustard is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated as a garden plant.</p>
