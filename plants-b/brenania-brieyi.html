<p>Brenania brieyi, commonly known as the pink ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale pink flowers that resemble the ghostly appearance of its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air rather than soil. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, adapted for capturing rainwater.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Brenania brieyi is considered critically endangered and is often found in protected conservation areas.</p>
