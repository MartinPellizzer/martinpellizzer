<p>Banksia anatona, commonly known as the narrow-leaved banksia, is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes, which are typically bright yellow or orange in color. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, a feature typical of the Proteaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Banksia anatona is well adapted to fire-prone environments and plays an important role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
