<p>Brya amorphoides, commonly known as the cushion moss, is a small, terrestrial moss that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It forms dense, low-growing mats and is often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a simple morphology with leaf-like structures that are typically curled or rolled when dry. Brya amorphoides reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called capsules.</p>
<p>This moss plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its habitat.</p>
