<p>Butia yatay subsp.</p>
<p>paraguayensis, commonly known as the Paraguay sunburst palm, is a striking palm native to parts of South America, particularly Paraguay and Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of long, feather-like leaves that give it a distinctive, elegant appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces large, yellowish-white inflorescences that bloom in the spring, adding to its ornamental value. It is well adapted to dry, tropical climates and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for landscaping in warm regions.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and cold hardiness make it a resilient and low-maintenance plant for gardeners.</p>
