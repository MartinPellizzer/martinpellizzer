                    <h1>Bromus virgatus</h1>
<p>Bromus virgatus, commonly known as smooth brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, each containing small, two-rowed flowers. Smooth brome is often found in disturbed soils and is used in forage and erosion control.</p>
<p>It is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive nature.</p>
