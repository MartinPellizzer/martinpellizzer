                    <h1>Boopis juergensii</h1>
<p>Boopis juergensii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features basal rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its succulent leaves store water, making it well-suited for survival in harsh, drought-prone habitats.</p>
<p>Boopis juergensii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing food for local wildlife.</p>
