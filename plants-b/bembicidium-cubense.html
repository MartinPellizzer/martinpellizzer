<p>Bembicidium cubense, commonly known as the Cuban ghost fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are positioned on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bembicidium cubense is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
