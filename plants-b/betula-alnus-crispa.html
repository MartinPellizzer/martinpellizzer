                    <h1>Betula alnus-crispa</h1>
<p>Betula alnus-crispa, commonly known as the crisped birch, is a deciduous tree native to northern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely toothed, papery bark that peels in thin, vertical strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the autumn. It produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are followed by small, winged seeds.</p>
<p>This species is often found in moist, calcareous soils and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture.</p>
