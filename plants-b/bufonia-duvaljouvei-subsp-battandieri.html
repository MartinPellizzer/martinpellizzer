<p>Bufonia duvaljouvei subsp.</p>
<p>battandieri, commonly known as the Duval's bufonia, is a rare and distinctive member of the Arecaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of pinnate leaves that give it a unique, palm-like appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with yellowish flowers, which are followed by dark, oval-shaped fruits. Native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in botanical collections.</p>
