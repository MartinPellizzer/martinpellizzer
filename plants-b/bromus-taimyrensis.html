                <h1>Bromus taimyrensis</h1>
<p>Bromus taimyrensis, commonly known as the Taimyren grass, is a species of annual grass native to the Arctic regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments, often found in tundra and alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Bromus taimyrensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in these extreme ecosystems and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions.</p>
