                    <h1>Botrychium obliquum var. oblongifolium</h1>
<p>Botrychium obliquum var. oblongifolium, commonly known as the oblong-leaf moonwort, is a fern species native to parts of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, often spiral arrangement of fronds, which are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia in clusters called soruses, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky stream banks.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its elongated, oblong-shaped leaves, which set it apart from other species in the genus Botrychium.</p>
