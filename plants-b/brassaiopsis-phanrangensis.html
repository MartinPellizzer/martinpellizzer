                    <h1>Brassaiopsis phanrangensis</h1>
<p>Brassaiopsis phanrangensis, commonly known as the Phanrang mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and fleshy, sticky berries that facilitate seed dispersal by birds. The plant attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, such as eucalypts and rainforest trees, using a haustellum to extract water and nutrients. Its ecological role is significant in maintaining the biodiversity of its forest ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
