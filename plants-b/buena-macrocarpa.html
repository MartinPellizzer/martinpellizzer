<p>Buena macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant sequoia, is a towering coniferous tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its massive, buttressed roots and thick, flaky bark that provides resistance to fire and pests. The tree produces small, inconspicuous cones that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are needle-like and arranged in spirals, typical of coniferous species.</p>
<p>Buena macrocarpa is renowned for its longevity, with some individuals living over 3,000 years, making it one of the oldest living organisms on Earth.</p>
