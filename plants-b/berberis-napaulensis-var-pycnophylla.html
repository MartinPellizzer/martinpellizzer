                    <h1>Berberis napaulensis var. pycnophylla</h1>
<p>Berberis napaulensis var. pycnophylla, commonly known as the dense-leaved barberry, is a shrub native to the Himalayas and parts of northern India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and thorny stems, which are typical features of the Berberis genus. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but often tart. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rocky or woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes.</p>
