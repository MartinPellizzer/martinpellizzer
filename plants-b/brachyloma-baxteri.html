<p>Brachyloma baxteri, commonly known as the Baxter's billygoat tussock, is a flowering plant native to the south-western region of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in heathlands and sandy soils, often in areas with low rainfall. The plant features a dense, tufted growth habit with small, narrow leaves and produces clusters of pale yellow flowers during the spring. It is characterized by its ability to form tussocks and is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Brachyloma baxteri is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological role.</p>
