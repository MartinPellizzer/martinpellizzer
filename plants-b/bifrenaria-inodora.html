                    <h1>Bifrenaria inodora</h1>
<p>Bifrenaria inodora, commonly known as the white-flowered ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often vine-like growth habit and its striking white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its roots for photosynthesis, making it a unique epiphytic species. Its flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a few days, and it is pollinated by specific insects.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, Bifrenaria inodora is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
