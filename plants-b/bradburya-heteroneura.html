                    <h1>Bradburya heteroneura</h1>
<p>Bradburya heteroneura, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale green leaves and a single, showy white or pale pink flower. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on the branches of hardwood trees.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and declining populations, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts.</p>
