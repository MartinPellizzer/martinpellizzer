                    <h1>Bromus patulus var. polymorphus</h1>
<p>Bromus patulus var. polymorphus, commonly known as the variable brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands, roadsides, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender,丛生 stems that can reach heights of up to 60 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, which are often tinged with purple or brown.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its morphological variability, which can make it challenging to distinguish from other bromus species.</p>
