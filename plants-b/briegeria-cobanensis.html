                    <h1>Briegeria cobanensis</h1>
<p>Briegeria cobanensis, commonly known as the Cob√°n fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the highlands of northeastern Guatemala.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in dense forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of its leaves, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Briegeria cobanensis is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
