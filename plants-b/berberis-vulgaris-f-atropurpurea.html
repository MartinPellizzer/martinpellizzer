<p>Berberis vulgaris f. atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple barberry, is a compact shrub characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that turn a striking purple-red in the autumn.</p>
<p>It produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by orange-red berries that persist into winter. The plant is native to Europe and western Asia and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>Its hedges and borders provide both visual interest and seasonal color throughout the year.</p>
