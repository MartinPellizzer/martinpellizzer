<p>Brathys pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered brathys, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, daisy-like flowers are usually pale yellow to white, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Brathys pauciflora is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
