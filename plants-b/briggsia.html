                    <h1>Briggsia</h1>
<p>Briggsia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant belonging to the family Onagraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, lantern-like flowers that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night. The plant is native to the wetlands of Florida and is often found in swampy, poorly drained soils. Briggsia has no true leaves, instead relying on modified stems for photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Its ephemeral blooms, which last only a few days, make it a rare and fascinating subject for botanical study.</p>
