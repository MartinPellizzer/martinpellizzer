                    <h1>Bromus rigidus f. asperipes</h1>
<p>Bromus rigidus f. asperipes, commonly known as the rough brome, is a grass species characterized by its robust, tufted growth habit and coarse, rigid leaves.</p>
<p>It typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as fields and roadsides, across temperate regions. The inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of spikelets, each bearing two to three florets. Its seeds are small, smooth, and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its adaptability.</p>
<p>The plant's morphology reflects its ability to thrive in challenging environments, making it a common weed in agricultural and natural settings.</p>
