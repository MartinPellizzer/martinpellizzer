<p>Bonania emarginata subsp.</p>
<p>suborbiculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bonania, is a small shrub native to the tropical rainforests of northern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves with a distinctive emarginate (notched) tip.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in spikes, often appearing in late summer to early autumn. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to humid, shaded environments and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat.</p>
