                    <h1>Balanophora tobiracola</h1>
<p>Balanophora tobiracola, commonly known as the Japanese ghost orchid, is a rare parasitic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of other plants. The plant produces showy, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. Its unique morphology includes a short, fleshy stem and a single, elongated leaf.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native regions.</p>
