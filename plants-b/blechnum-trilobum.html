<p>Blechnum trilobum, commonly known as the three-lobed holly fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green and have a leathery texture. The fronds are divided into multiple lobes, with the most distinctive feature being the three-lobed shape of the terminal pinnae. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical reproductive feature of ferns.</p>
