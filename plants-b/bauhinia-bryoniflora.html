<p>It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling flames, hence its common name.

Bauhinia bryoniflora thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in warm climates.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation.</p>
