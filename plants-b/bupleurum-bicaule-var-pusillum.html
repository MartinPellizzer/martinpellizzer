<p>Bupleurum bicaule var. pusillum, commonly known as the small-stemmed valerian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, branching stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale blue or white, blooming in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in the wild.</p>
