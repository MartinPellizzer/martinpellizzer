                    <h1>Bulbophyllum injoloense var. pseudoxypterum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum injoloense var. pseudoxypterum, commonly known as the Injolo orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of West Africa.</p>
<p>It features elongated, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding its survival in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pale green to yellowish flowers with intricate patterns, typical of the Bulbophyllum genus. Its leaves are usually dark green and leathery, adapted to retain moisture.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
