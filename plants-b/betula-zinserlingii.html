                    <h1>Betula zinserlingii</h1>
<p>Betula zinserlingii, commonly known as the Zinserling's birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often multi-trunked form and smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by triangular, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and turn yellow in the fall, contributing to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Betula zinserlingii is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in subalpine and alpine forests.</p>
