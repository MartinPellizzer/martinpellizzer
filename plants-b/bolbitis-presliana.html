                    <h1>Bolbitis presliana</h1>
<p>Bolbitis presliana, commonly known as the Preslia's hart's-tongue fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, leathery fronds that resemble the shape of a hart's tongue, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bolbitis presliana is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
