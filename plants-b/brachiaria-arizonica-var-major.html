                    <h1>Brachiaria arizonica var. major</h1>
<p>Brachiaria arizonica var. major, commonly known as Arizona grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ability to form dense stands, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions.</p>
