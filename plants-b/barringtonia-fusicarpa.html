<p>Barringtonia fusicarpa, commonly known as the bottle tree, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, bottle-shaped trunk that stores water, an adaptation to its seasonal climate. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, attracting moths for pollination. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds.</p>
<p>The leaves are palmately lobed and have a distinctive waxy coating.</p>
