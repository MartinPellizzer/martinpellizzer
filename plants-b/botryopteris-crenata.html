<p>Botryopteris crenata, commonly known as the crested water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Asia and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that are often curled or crinkled, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant in the substrate while its fronds float on the water surface.</p>
<p>Botryopteris crenata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
