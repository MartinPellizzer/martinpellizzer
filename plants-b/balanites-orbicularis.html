                    <h1>Balanites orbicularis</h1>
<p>Balanites orbicularis, commonly known as the desert date tree, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The tree produces yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, fleshy fruits containing a single seed. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-resistant.</p>
<p>The plant is also valued for its timber and has cultural significance in some regions.</p>
