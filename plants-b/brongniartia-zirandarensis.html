                    <h1>Brongniartia zirandarensis</h1>
<p>Brongniartia zirandarensis, commonly known as the Zirandar√© cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered critically endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and evolutionary history make it an important subject in botanical research.</p>
