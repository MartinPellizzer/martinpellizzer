<p>Brachypodium sylvaticum var. laeve, commonly known as the smooth wood rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its upright, slender stems and small, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of tiny, white to pale green flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a common component of forest understories.</p>
