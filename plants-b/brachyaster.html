                    <h1>Brachyaster</h1>
<p>Brachyaster, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in coastal areas, where they thrive in sandy or rocky substrates. Brachyaster species are characterized by their compact growth habit and showy, blue to purple ray florets. Their leaves are usually narrow and sometimes covered in a fine layer of salt, which helps them retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Brachyaster falcatus and Brachyaster stamineus, which are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance in marine ecosystems.</p>
