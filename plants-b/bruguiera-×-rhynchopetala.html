<p>Bruguiera × rhynchopetala, commonly known as the mangrove hybrid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Bruguiera gymnorrhiza and Bruguiera sexangula.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that thrives in saline and brackish water environments, typically found in mangrove forests. The plant has pneumatophores, which are specialized root structures that facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Bruguiera × rhynchopetala plays a crucial role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
