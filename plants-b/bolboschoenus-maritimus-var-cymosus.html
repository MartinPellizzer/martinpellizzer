                    <h1>Bolboschoenus maritimus var. cymosus</h1>
<p>Bolboschoenus maritimus var. cymosus, commonly known as the coastal sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. The plant thrives in saline and brackish wetlands, often forming dense mats that stabilize shorelines. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its ecological resilience.</p>
<p>It plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and stabilizing soil against erosion.</p>
