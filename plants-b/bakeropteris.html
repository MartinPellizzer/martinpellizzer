                    <h1>Bakeropteris</h1>
<p>Bakeropteris, commonly known as the "bark fern," is a genus of fossilized plants from the Carboniferous period.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, large, and often lobed fronds that resemble the leaves of modern ferns. These plants were likely terrestrial, growing in swampy environments with high humidity and abundant moisture. Bakeropteris fossils are frequently found in coal deposits, indicating their prevalence in ancient forests.</p>
<p>The genus provides important insights into the evolution of early vascular plants and the development of complex plant structures.</p>
