                    <h1>Braxilia viridiflora</h1>
<p>Braxilia viridiflora, commonly known as the emerald-flowered brax, is a rare flowering plant native to the dense rainforests of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking greenish-yellow petals and heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, clustered fruits that contain seeds with a unique spiral pattern. It thrives in high humidity and partial shade, making it a challenging species to cultivate outside its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Braxilia viridiflora is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas.</p>
