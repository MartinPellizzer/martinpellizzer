<p>Biscutella nana, commonly known as dwarf biscuitroot, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>

The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Biscutella nana is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine conditions.</p>
