                    <h1>Berberis caudatifolia</h1>
<p>Berberis caudatifolia, commonly known as the long-tailed barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit, with thorny stems and compound leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often sour. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant for gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and winter interest, with the stems retaining their color throughout the colder months.</p>
