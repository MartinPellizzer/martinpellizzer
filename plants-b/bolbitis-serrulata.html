                    <h1>Bolbitis serrulata</h1>
<p>Bolbitis serrulata, commonly known as the serrated water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other water ferns. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring it to the substrate while its leaves float on the water's surface.</p>
<p>Bolbitis serrulata is valued in aquariums for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
