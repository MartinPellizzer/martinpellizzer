<p>Bolbosaponaria fedtschenkoana, commonly known as the Fedtschenko's bulbous soapwort, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive bulbous root system and its clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soil. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
