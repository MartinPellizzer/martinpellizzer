                    <h1>Borreria aspera</h1>
<p>Borreria aspera, commonly known as rough borreria, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its hairy, often woody stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces tiny, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Borreria aspera is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>It is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
