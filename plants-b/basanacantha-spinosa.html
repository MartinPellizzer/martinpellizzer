                    <h1>Basanacantha spinosa</h1>
<p>Basanacantha spinosa, commonly known as the spiny devil's backbone, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems covered in sharp, spiny projections, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are typically small, narrow, and often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Basanacantha spinosa is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal rainfall.</p>
