<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of spiky, grass-like leaves that form a central cup. The plant produces a flowering stem that eventually bears a fruit resembling a pineapple. Its leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss in its native habitat.</p>
