                    <h1>Buxus aurea</h1>
<p>Buxus aurea, commonly known as the golden boxwood, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense, glossy, dark green foliage with a distinctive yellowish tinge on the undersides of the leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for hedging and topiary.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth rate and compact form, it is often used in formal garden designs.</p>
