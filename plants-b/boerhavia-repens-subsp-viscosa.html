<p>Boerhavia repens subsp.</p>
<p>viscosa, commonly known as sticky bluemink, is a low-growing annual plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground.</p>
<p>The leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy surface that gives the plant its sticky texture. It produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in clusters, which bloom throughout the growing season.</p>
<p>This species is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
