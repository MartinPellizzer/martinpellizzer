<p>Bolboschoenus fluviatilis, commonly known as the river sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or saturated soil, forming dense clumps with slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which are often submerged or partially submerged in water. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to spread vegetatively and stabilize soil in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Bolboschoenus fluviatilis plays an important ecological role in filtering water and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
