<p>Bolboschoenus macrostachys, commonly known as the broad-stalked bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense stands in shallow water or moist soils. The plant produces large, showy panicles of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize wetland areas effectively.</p>
<p>Bolboschoenus macrostachys plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for aquatic wildlife.</p>
