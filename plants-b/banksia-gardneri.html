                    <h1>Banksia gardneri</h1>
<p>Banksia gardneri, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a species of shrub or small tree native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are released after the follicles dry and split open. Banksia gardneri is adapted to fire-prone environments and has a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in providing nectar for native wildlife.</p>
