<p>Biscutella sempervirens subsp.</p>
<p>montana, commonly known as mountain biscuitroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in early spring.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in alpine or subalpine environments. It is an important component of high-altitude flora and is valued for its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>The subspecies montana is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and habitat preferences compared to the typical form of B. sempervirens.</p>
