                    <h1>Bassia lobbii</h1>
<p>Bassia lobbii, commonly known as the Namib Desert sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of Namibia and Angola.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh desert conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a splash of color to the sandy landscape. It is well adapted to extreme drought, with deep root systems that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Bassia lobbii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
