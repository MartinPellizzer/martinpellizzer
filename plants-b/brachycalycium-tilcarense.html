<p>Brachycalycium tilcarense, commonly known as the Tildor cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, globular stem covered in dense, white to pale green tubercles. The plant produces delicate, pink to violet flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
