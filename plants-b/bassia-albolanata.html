<p>Bassia albolanata, commonly known as white sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>

The plant produces small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Bassia albolanata is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils and can tolerate high temperatures and limited water availability.</p>
