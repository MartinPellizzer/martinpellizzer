<p>Botrypus anthemoides, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams, where it attaches itself to submerged surfaces. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds that float on the water's surface, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically found on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Botrypus anthemoides plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and aiding in water filtration.</p>
