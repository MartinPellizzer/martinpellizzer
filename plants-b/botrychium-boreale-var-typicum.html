<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a fleshy, creeping rhizome and a single, broad, ovate leaf that is often divided into two lobes. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of the leaf, which are clustered in a distinctive, rounded cluster known as a sorus.
