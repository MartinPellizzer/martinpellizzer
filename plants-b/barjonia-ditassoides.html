<p>Barjonia ditassoides, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with gray-green, succulent leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Barjonia ditassoides plays an important role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
