                    <h1>Billbergia mexicana</h1>
<p>Billbergia mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican billbergia, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its striking rosette of narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a layer of white, powdery bloom. The plant produces vibrant orange or red flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, adding a dramatic visual contrast. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Billbergia mexicana is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
