<p>Boscia tomentella, commonly known as the woolly boscia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, woolly coating of white or gray hairs on its stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy, red or orange fruits. Its leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a leathery texture, and it is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Boscia tomentella is well adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
