                    <h1>Botrychium dissectum var. typicum</h1>
<p>Botrychium dissectum var. typicum, commonly known as the dissected moonwort, is a rare fern species characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Onocleaceae and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The plant has a unique reproductive structure called a sorus, which contains the spore-producing organs. Its leaves are finely dissected, giving it a lacy appearance, and it often grows close to the ground.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its specific leaf morphology and habitat preferences compared to other forms of Botrychium.</p>
