<p>Bixa orellana var. platycarpa, commonly known as the "false annatto" or "brazil nut tree," is a member of the Malvaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and produces yellow-orange flowers that develop into woody capsules containing edible seeds. The seeds are often used as a substitute for true Brazil nuts, though they are smaller and have a different flavor profile.</p>
<p>The plant also has ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and is sometimes cultivated for its potential medicinal properties.</p>
