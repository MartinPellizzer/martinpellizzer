<p>Briza media var. dublanensis, commonly known as the Dublan grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and delicate, feathery inflorescences that resemble those of other briza species. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that adds a subtle ornamental quality to its appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native habitat.</p>
