<p>It is a deciduous vine characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of vibrant yellow flowers with a distinctive, tubular shape that bloom in the spring. Its foliage is often covered in fine, hairy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Bignonia microphylla is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun.</p>
