<p>Bigelovia gracilis, commonly known as the slender bigelovia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in sandy or rocky soils. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Bigelovia gracilis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
