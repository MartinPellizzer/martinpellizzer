<p>Batopedina pulvinellata subsp.</p>
<p>pulvinellata, commonly known as the pulvinellate batopedina, is a rare and specialized liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its small, closely spaced leaves that form dense, mat-like growths on moist, shaded substrates.</p>
<p>The plant exhibits a unique thalloid structure with a distinct pulvinate (pulvinate) base, which is a characteristic feature of its subspecies. It typically thrives in humid, temperate environments, often found in rocky crevices or on decaying wood.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
