<p>Betula pubescens var. golitsinii, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a variant of the white birch native to cold climates in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark that often peels in thin, papery layers, and its small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers and is well adapted to harsh, northern environments. It is often found in taiga regions and can thrive in poor, acidic soils.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
