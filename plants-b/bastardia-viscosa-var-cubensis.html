                    <h1>Bastardia viscosa var. cubensis</h1>
<p>Bastardia viscosa var. cubensis, commonly known as Cuban sticky weed, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, also known as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and coastal environments, with a thick cuticle that reduces water loss. Its sticky secretions on the leaves help deter herbivores and may also aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its resilience in saline and sandy soils, making it a common sight in coastal dunes and rocky habitats.</p>
