                    <h1>Benthamistella</h1>
<p>Benthamistella, commonly known as the "buttercup moss," is a genus of liverworts belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically small, non-vascular, and thrive in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock surfaces. They have a thalloid structure, which is a flat, leaf-like body that lacks true roots, stems, or leaves. Benthamistella species are characterized by their intricate leaf arrangement and the presence of specialized reproductive structures called gemmae.</p>
<p>Their botanical study contributes to the understanding of early land plant evolution and ecological diversity in humid habitats.</p>
