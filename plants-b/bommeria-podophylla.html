                <h1>Bommeria podophylla</h1>
<p>Bommeria podophylla, commonly known as the sandstone lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>It forms a dense, crust-like growth on rock surfaces, particularly on sandstone, and is often found in coastal and inland desert regions. The thallus is dark green to blackish in color, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture in harsh conditions. It plays a vital role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its native habitats.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to survive in extreme conditions makes it an important indicator species for ecological health.</p>
