<p>Balanites quarrei, commonly known as the desert date tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Bombacaceae and is characterized by its thick, flaky bark and compound leaves that are often shed during dry seasons. The plant produces yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers followed by woody, spiny pods containing edible seeds. Balanites quarrei is adapted to survive in harsh environments, storing water in its thick stems and having deep root systems to access underground moisture.</p>
<p>Its seeds are an important food source for both wildlife and humans in regions where it is found.</p>
