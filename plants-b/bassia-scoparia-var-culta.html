                    <h1>Bassia scoparia var. culta</h1>
<p>Bassia scoparia var. culta, commonly known as tumbleweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and its ability to thrive in dry, sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. After flowering, it develops into a dry, wind-dispersed seed ball, which is a key feature of its life cycle.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
