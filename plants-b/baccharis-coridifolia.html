<p>Baccharis coridifolia, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub or small tree native to the southern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which provides a striking visual contrast against its green stems and branches. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters, typically in late summer to early fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodlands.</p>
<p>Baccharis coridifolia is also known for its ability to tolerate drought and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
