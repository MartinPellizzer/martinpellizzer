<p>Byrsonima chrysophylla, commonly known as the golden-leaved soursop, is a small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that turn a striking golden yellow during the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that give way to round, spiny fruits resembling those of the soursop. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a woody, branched stem.</p>
<p>The leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly serrated margin.</p>
