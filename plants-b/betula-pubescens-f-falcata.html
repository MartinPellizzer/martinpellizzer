                    <h1>Betula pubescens f. falcata</h1>
<p>Betula pubescens f. falcata, commonly known as the downy birch, is a variant of the silver birch characterized by its distinctive, drooping branches.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous tree native to northern Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing in moist, acidic soils. The leaves are small, oval, and have a serrated edge, turning yellow in autumn. Its bark is smooth and grayish-white, often peeling in thin, papery layers.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow catkins in early spring, which are an important food source for pollinators.</p>
