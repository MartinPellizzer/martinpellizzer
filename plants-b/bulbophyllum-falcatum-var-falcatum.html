                    <h1>Bulbophyllum falcatum var. falcatum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum falcatum var. falcatum, commonly known as the cat's claw orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, claw-like sepals and petals that give it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforests. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a faintly fragrant scent, and it blooms during the rainy season.</p>
<p>The plant's pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
