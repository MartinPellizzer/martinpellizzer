                    <h1>Briza compacta</h1>
<p>Briza compacta, commonly known as silvergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features fine, silver-gray blades that are tightly packed, giving it a compact appearance. The plant produces delicate, feathery flower spikes in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil, it is a popular choice for ecological restoration projects.</p>
