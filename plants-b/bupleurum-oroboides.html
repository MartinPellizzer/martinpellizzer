                    <h1>Bupleurum oroboides</h1>
<p>Bupleurum oroboides, commonly known as the alpine bupleurum, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant features slender, branched stems that bear small, blue to purple flowers arranged in umbel-like clusters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Bupleurum oroboides is valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits, though its botanical significance lies in its adaptation to harsh, cold climates.</p>
