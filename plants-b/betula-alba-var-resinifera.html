<p>Betula alba var. resinifera, commonly known as the silver birch variant with resinous characteristics, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is distinguished by its white, papery bark that peels in thin, vertical strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are essential for pollination. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in autumn before falling.</p>
<p>This variety is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and is often used in reforestation efforts due to its hardiness.</p>
