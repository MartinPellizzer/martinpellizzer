                    <h1>Bonellia</h1>
<p>Bonellia, commonly known as the "barnacle worm," is a marine polychaete annelid belonging to the family Bonellidae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive morphology, featuring a small, worm-like body with a specialized anterior region called the acicula. Bonellia typically inhabits shallow coastal waters and is often found attached to substrates such as rocks or shells. The plant-like appearance of its anterior end has led to its common name, though it is not a true plant.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes contributing to benthic communities and serving as prey for various marine organisms.</p>
