<p>Blechnum mochaenum var. squamipes, commonly known as the Mochaena fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive scaly appearance on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori.</p>
