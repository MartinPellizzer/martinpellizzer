                    <h1>Bacopa debilis</h1>
<p>Bacopa debilis, commonly known as small-leaf water hyssop, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. The plant has opposite, narrow leaves and produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in clusters. Its stems are often prostrate or trailing, allowing it to spread across the surface of water or damp soil.</p>
<p>Bacopa debilis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality.</p>
