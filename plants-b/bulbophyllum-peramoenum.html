                    <h1>Bulbophyllum peramoenum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum peramoenum, commonly known as the Bornean ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, storing water and nutrients to help it survive in its humid, shaded habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
