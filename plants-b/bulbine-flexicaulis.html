                    <h1>Bulbine flexicaulis</h1>
<p>Bulbine flexicaulis, commonly known as the broad-leaved bulbine, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of yellow or orange, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance gardens.</p>
