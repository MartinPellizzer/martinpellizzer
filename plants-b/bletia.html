                    <h1>Bletia</h1>
<p>Bletia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, often pale or greenish flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in moist, shaded environments, forming a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi for nutrient uptake. Bletia species have a compact growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, clustered inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
