                    <h1>Baccharis humilis</h1>
<p>Baccharis humilis, commonly known as brittle bush, is a low-growing shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its fibrous roots help prevent soil erosion, and it is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>The leaves are aromatic and can be used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
