                    <h1>Bertya virgata</h1>
<p>Bertya virgata, commonly known as the coastal bertya, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in coastal conditions.</p>
<p>Bertya virgata is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in salt-laden environments.</p>
