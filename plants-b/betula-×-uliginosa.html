                    <h1>Betula × uliginosa</h1>
<p>Betula × uliginosa, commonly known as the black spruce, is a hybrid conifer native to northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and conical shape, often found in wetland and bog habitats. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Its needles are typically dark green and arranged in crossed pairs, while its roots form extensive networks that help stabilize peat soils.</p>
<p>Betula × uliginosa plays a crucial role in boreal and subarctic ecosystems, providing habitat and contributing to carbon sequestration.</p>
