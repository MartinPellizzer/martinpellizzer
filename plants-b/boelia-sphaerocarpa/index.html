<p>Cape gooseberry, scientifically known as Boelia sphaerocarpa, is a small, edible fruit native to South America. It is often mistaken for a tomato due to its similar appearance and growth habits. The fruit is prized for its sweet, tangy flavor and is commonly used in culinary applications. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil to flourish. Despite its modest size, the Cape gooseberry holds cultural and nutritional significance in many regions.</p>
