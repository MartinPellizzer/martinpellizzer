<p>Boopis agglomerata var. sanjuanina, commonly known as San Juan agglomerate, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and small, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
