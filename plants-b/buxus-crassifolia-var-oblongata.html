                    <h1>Buxus crassifolia var. oblongata</h1>
<p>Buxus crassifolia var. oblongata, commonly known as the broadleaf boxwood, is a compact evergreen shrub native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense, dark green foliage with elliptical, leathery leaves that are broader than those of the typical boxwood. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for hedges and topiary.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and hardy nature make it suitable for various garden conditions.</p>
