                    <h1>Baillonia juncea</h1>
<p>Baillonia juncea, commonly known as the yellow mimosa, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, characterized by its slender branches and bipinnate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are encased in a hairy, pod-like structure that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind.</p>
<p>Baillonia juncea is often found in sandy or limestone soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a common sight in coastal and inland regions.</p>
