                    <h1>Banksia glutinosa</h1>
<p>Banksia glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southwestern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers that are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences, which are highly attractive to nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant produces woody cone-like structures called follicles, which contain seeds covered in a sticky resin. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its often arid habitat.</p>
<p>Banksia glutinosa plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens.</p>
