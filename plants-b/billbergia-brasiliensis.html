<p>Billbergia brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from red to orange and yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Billbergia brasiliensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in indoor environments.</p>
