<p>Betula pendula f. oycowiensis, commonly known as the Weeping Willow, is a striking ornamental tree characterized by its drooping branches that cascade like a curtain of foliage.</p>
<p>It is a naturally occurring form of the European white birch, distinguished by its long, pendulous twigs that create a flowing, ethereal appearance. The leaves are typically slender, lance-shaped, and turn a striking yellow in the autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies.</p>
<p>This cultivar is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is widely used in landscaping and riparian restoration projects.</p>
