                    <h1>Bulbophyllum vulinhiae</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum vulinhiae, commonly known as the Violet Ghost Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pale violet flowers that resemble ghosts, hence its common name. The plant produces a single, elongated pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in the understory of tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range.</p>
