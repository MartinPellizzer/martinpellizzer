<p>Brachypodium sylvaticum, commonly known as woodland false brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its丛生 growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ability to colonize disturbed soils, it is often found in ecological restoration projects.</p>
