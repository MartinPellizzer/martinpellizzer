<p>Balanophora harlandii, commonly known as the Harland's ghost orchid, is an epiphytic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll and reliance on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption, making it a hemiparasitic species. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers that bloom in late spring. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and Georgia, where it grows on the bark of trees.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species.</p>
