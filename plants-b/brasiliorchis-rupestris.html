                    <h1>Brasiliorchis rupestris</h1>
<p>Brasiliorchis rupestris, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to the Atlantic rainforests of Brazil.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree trunks or rock surfaces, relying on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the environment. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a subtle fragrance, which attract specific pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to minimize water loss in its humid yet competitive habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
