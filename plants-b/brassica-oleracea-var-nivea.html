                    <h1>Brassica oleracea var. nivea</h1>
<p>Brassica oleracea var. nivea, commonly known as cauliflower, is a cultivar of the cabbage family characterized by its dense, white curd.</p>
<p>The plant is a biennial, though it is typically grown as an annual, and it produces a head of tightly packed florets that are typically white, though some varieties may have purple or green hues. The leaves are thick, fleshy, and form a basal rosette, providing protection to the developing head. The curd is the edible part, rich in nutrients and often used in a variety of culinary dishes.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool climates and requires a long growing season to develop properly.</p>
