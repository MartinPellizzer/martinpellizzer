                    <h1>Balanophora wrightii</h1>
<p>Balanophora wrightii, commonly known as the Wright's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant lacks chlorophyll and is therefore unable to perform photosynthesis, relying instead on its host for sustenance. It produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
