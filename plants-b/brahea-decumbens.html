<p>Brahea decumbens, commonly known as the lowland blue agave, is a succulent plant native to the southern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of thick, blue-gray leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces a tall, branched flowering stalk that bears small, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
