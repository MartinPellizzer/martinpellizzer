The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink and white, typically arranged in clusters. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
