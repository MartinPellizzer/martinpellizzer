<p>Berberis liophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely textured, silver-gray leaves that provide a striking visual contrast to its red or orange berries. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by the edible, tart berries that attract various wildlife. Berberis liophylla thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its seasonal color changes and compact growth habit.</p>
