                    <h1>Brazoria enquistii</h1>
<p>Brazoria enquistii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, fleshy leaves that store water, a key adaptation to its harsh environment. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, with parachute-like structures that allow them to travel long distances.</p>
<p>Brazoria enquistii is often found in disturbed soils and plays a role in stabilizing sandy or rocky landscapes.</p>
