<p>Brachyotum lycopodioides, commonly known as the small clubmoss, is a rare and endangered vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and produces sporophytes with spore-bearing strobili. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it has a unique reproductive structure that sets it apart from other clubmosses.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
