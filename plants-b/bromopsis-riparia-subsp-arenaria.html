<p>Bromopsis riparia subsp.</p>
<p>arenaria, commonly known as the sand couch grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments or along coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and preventing erosion.</p>
