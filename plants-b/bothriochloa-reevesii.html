<p>Bothriochloa reevesii, commonly known as Reeves' panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and flooded meadows, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a prominent midrib and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is characterized by its fibrous roots and its ability to tolerate periodic flooding, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
