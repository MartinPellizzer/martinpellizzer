                    <h1>Butia marmorii</h1>
<p>Butia marmorii, commonly known as the marble palm, is a striking member of the Arecaceae family native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of long, pinnate leaves that give it a graceful appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-pink flowers that eventually develop into dark blue, edible fruits. Its unique, mottled trunk pattern resembles marble, hence its common name.</p>
<p>Butia marmorii is well adapted to arid environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in warm climates.</p>
