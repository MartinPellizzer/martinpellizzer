                    <h1>Borzicactus doelzianus</h1>
<p>Borzicactus doelzianus, commonly known as the Doelzian's barrel cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green body. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted for minimizing water loss through reduced surface area.</p>
<p>Borzicactus doelzianus is typically found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements.</p>
