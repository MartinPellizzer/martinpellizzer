                    <h1>Bassia nitida</h1>
<p>Bassia nitida, commonly known as silverleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Bassia nitida is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native environment.</p>
