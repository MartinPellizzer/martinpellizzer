                    <h1>Berberis thunbergii f. atropurpurea</h1>
<p>Berberis thunbergii f. atropurpurea, commonly known as Japanese barberry, is a compact, deciduous shrub characterized by its upright growth habit and dense foliage.</p>
<p>Its leaves are typically oval to elliptical, with a distinctive dark purple to red hue, especially on the underside, which becomes more pronounced in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. It is native to Japan and has been widely cultivated for its ornamental value and hardiness.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often restricted in certain areas where it can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
