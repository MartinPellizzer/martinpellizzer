                    <h1>Bothriochloa radicans</h1>
<p>Bothriochloa radicans, commonly known as the creeping bermudagrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread aggressively across the ground. The plant has narrow, flat leaves with a bluish-green color and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a common weed in lawns and agricultural areas.</p>
<p>Its ability to form dense mats makes it both a useful forage crop and a challenging invasive species.</p>
