                    <h1>Boerhavia boissieri</h1>
<p>Boerhavia boissieri, commonly known as the desert bluemink, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with succulent, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Boerhavia boissieri is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
