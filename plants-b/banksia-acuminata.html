                    <h1>Banksia acuminata</h1>
<p>Banksia acuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant produces woody cone-like structures that hold the seeds, which are released after a fire, aiding in regeneration. Banksia acuminata is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role by providing food and habitat for various native wildlife species.</p>
