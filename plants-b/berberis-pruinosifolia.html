                    <h1>Berberis pruinosifolia</h1>
<p>Berberis pruinosifolia, commonly known as the silverberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-white, glandular hairs that cover its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and some mammals. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a pointed tip and are often covered in a waxy coating.</p>
<p>Berberis pruinosifolia is well adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
