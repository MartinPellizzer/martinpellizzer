                    <h1>Betula dioica</h1>
<p>Betula dioica, commonly known as the dwarf birch, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces catkins, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, a feature known as dioecy. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in tundra or boreal forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Betula dioica plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and is also used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
