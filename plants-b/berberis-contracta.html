                    <h1>Berberis contracta</h1>
<p>Berberis contracta, commonly known as the creeping barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense, thorny stems that often grow close to the ground, forming a low, mat-like structure. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but typically not consumed by humans. Its leaves are alternate, oval-shaped, and have a glossy green surface with a slightly serrated edge.</p>
<p>Berberis contracta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in rocky or well-drained soils.</p>
