                    <h1>Balanophora gigantea</h1>
<p>Balanophora gigantea, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of trees in tropical rainforests. The plant produces large, showy flowers with a distinctive yellow and white coloration, often resembling those of other orchids. Its growth is slow, and it can live for several decades, making it a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and habitat specificity, Balanophora gigantea is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and deforestation.</p>
