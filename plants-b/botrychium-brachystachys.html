                    <h1>Botrychium brachystachys</h1>
<p>Botrychium brachystachys, commonly known as the short-stalked moonwort, is a small, delicate fern that belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single, upright sporophyte with a short, stout stem and a pair of lanceolate, glossy leaves. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of the leaves, which are clustered in a distinctive, umbrella-like structure called a sorus. Botrychium brachystachys is typically found in moist, shaded habitats, such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
