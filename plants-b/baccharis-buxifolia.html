                    <h1>Baccharis buxifolia</h1>
<p>Baccharis buxifolia, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Uruguay.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that has a silvery-white appearance due to the presence of fine, soft hairs on the leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces small, clustered yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits.</p>
<p>Baccharis buxifolia is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate drought conditions.</p>
