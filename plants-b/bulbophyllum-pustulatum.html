                    <h1>Bulbophyllum pustulatum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum pustulatum, commonly known as the pustular orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, bulb-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in tropical environments. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green, often with intricate patterns. It thrives in humid, shaded conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts.</p>
