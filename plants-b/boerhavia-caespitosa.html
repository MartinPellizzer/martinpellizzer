<p>Boerhavia caespitosa, commonly known as redroot sandmat, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with branching stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, pink to violet flowers that bloom in summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy surface, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Boerhavia caespitosa is drought-tolerant and often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements.</p>
