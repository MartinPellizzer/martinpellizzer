<p>Brachypodium sylvaticum var. glaucovirens, commonly known as the glaucous woodland grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, blue-green leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
