                    <h1>Bilabrella riparia</h1>
<p>Bilabrella riparia, commonly known as the river lily, is a perennial aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in South America.</p>
<p>It features long, narrow leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the sediment. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread along the edges of rivers and streams.</p>
<p>Bilabrella riparia plays a vital role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for aquatic life.</p>
