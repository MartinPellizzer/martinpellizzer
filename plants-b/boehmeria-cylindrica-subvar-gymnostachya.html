<p>Boehmeria cylindrica subvar. gymnostachya, commonly known as the narrow-leaved horse-hair grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and stream sides.</p>
<p>Its fibrous stalks have been historically used for making textiles and paper due to their strong, flexible fibers.</p>
