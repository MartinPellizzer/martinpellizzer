                    <h1>Bifrenaria pickiana</h1>
<p>Bifrenaria pickiana, commonly known as the Pick's bifrenaria, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding structure. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting specific pollinators such as hummingbirds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments and its role in local ecosystems.</p>
