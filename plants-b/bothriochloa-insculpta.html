<p>Bothriochloa insculpta, commonly known as the African feather grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, grass-like leaves that are often used in ornamental gardening. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and ability to form dense, low-growing mats.</p>
