<p>Bulbophyllum pugilanthum, commonly known as the Fighting Orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and is typically found growing in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and white, often arranged in a raceme. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
<p>However, due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
