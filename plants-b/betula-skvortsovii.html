<p>Betula skvortsovii, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, followed by triangular, serrated leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in taiga and alpine regions.</p>
<p>Betula skvortsovii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in local ecosystems.</p>
