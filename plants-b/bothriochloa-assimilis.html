<p>Bothriochloa assimilis, commonly known as fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Bothriochloa assimilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in erosion control due to its dense root system.</p>
