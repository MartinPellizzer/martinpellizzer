                    <h1>Brachycorythis grandis</h1>
<p>Brachycorythis grandis, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a large, ancient plant species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Brachycorythis grandis is a slow-growing species that thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range.</p>
