<p>Buxus pilosula subsp.</p>
<p>cacuminis, commonly known as the hairy boxwood subspecies, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact foliage and small, dark green leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs.</p>
<p>The plant typically forms a rounded or cushion-like shape, making it suitable for use in rock gardens or as a ground cover. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appeal and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for landscaping in Mediterranean climates.</p>
