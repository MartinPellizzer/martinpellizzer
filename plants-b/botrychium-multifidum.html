                <h1>Botrychium multifidum</h1>
<p>Botrychium multifidum, commonly known as the multifid fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, feather-like fronds that are divided into multiple segments, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called soruses, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Botrychium multifidum is often found in temperate regions and is known for its ephemeral life cycle, with most of its growth occurring in a single season.</p>
