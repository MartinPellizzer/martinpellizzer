<p>Bidens remyi, commonly known as the Mexican ironweed, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in wetlands. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces clusters of small, yellow flowers with white markings. Its seeds are enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Bidens remyi is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations.</p>
