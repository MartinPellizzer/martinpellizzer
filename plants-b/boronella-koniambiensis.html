                    <h1>Boronella koniambiensis</h1>
<p>Boronella koniambiensis, commonly known as the Koniambe River fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to the wetlands of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It thrives in freshwater environments with high mineral content, particularly in areas with abundant boron. The plant has finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, aiding in photosynthesis. Its reproductive structures are concealed within small, spore-producing capsules that develop on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
