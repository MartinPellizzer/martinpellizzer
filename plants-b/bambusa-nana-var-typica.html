                    <h1>Bambusa nana var. typica</h1>
<p>Bambusa nana var. typica, commonly known as the dwarf bamboo, is a compact, clump-forming grass that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters.</p>
<p>It features narrow, dark green leaves that are often curled at the tips, giving it a unique, ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that eventually develop into elongated, cylindrical seed pods. It is native to southern China and is widely cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and dense foliage, it is well-suited for use in rock gardens, borders, or as a privacy screen.</p>
