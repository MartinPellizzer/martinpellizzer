                    <h1>Betula odorata var. sudetica</h1>
<p>Betula odorata var. sudetica, commonly known as the Bohemian birch, is a rare and ornamental variant of the European white birch.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, followed by oval, dark green leaves that turn gold in autumn. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions of Central Europe.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens and conservation efforts.</p>
