                    <h1>Bassia laniflora</h1>
<p>Bassia laniflora, commonly known as silky sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with hairy, silver-green foliage that helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring and attract pollinators like bees. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils, making it well-adapted to harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Bassia laniflora is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
