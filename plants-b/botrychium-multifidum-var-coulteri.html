                    <h1>Botrychium multifidum var. coulteri</h1>
<p>Botrychium multifidum var. coulteri, commonly known as Coulter's moonwort, is a rare fern species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a distinctive, umbrella-like arrangement on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas.</p>
