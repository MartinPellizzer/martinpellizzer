                    <h1>Blechnum × leopoldense</h1>
<p>Blechnum × leopoldense, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Blechnum capillifolium and Blechnum penna-marina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly glossy surface. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, and its fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive zigzag pattern along the veins. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
