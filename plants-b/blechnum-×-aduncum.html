                    <h1>Blechnum × aduncum</h1>
<p>Blechnum × aduncum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Blechnum capillipes and Blechnum penna-marina.</p>
<p>It is a perennial fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid environments.</p>
