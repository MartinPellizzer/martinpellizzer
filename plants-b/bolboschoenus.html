                    <h1>Bolboschoenus</h1>
<p>Bolboschoenus, commonly known as the tussock sedge, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in wetland habitats, such as marshes and peat bogs, where they form dense tussocks. Bolboschoenus species are characterized by their upright, grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow, strap-shaped leaves. They produce small, clustered flowers that are usually inconspicuous, and they play an important role in stabilizing wetland soils.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to thrive in saturated conditions.</p>
