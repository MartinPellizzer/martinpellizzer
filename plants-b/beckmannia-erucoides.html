<p>Beckmannia erucoides, commonly known as the woolly burr grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces distinctive, spiny, woolly seed heads. The plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it useful for erosion control.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow and grass-like, while the flowering stems are often erect and covered in soft, hairy structures.</p>
