                    <h1>Bromelia dilatata</h1>
<p>Bromelia dilatata, commonly known as the giant bromeliad, is a striking plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its large, rosette-shaped leaves that form a central water-holding structure. The leaves are typically broad, stiff, and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its humid, tropical habitat. It produces vibrant, showy inflorescences that can last for several months, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens.</p>
