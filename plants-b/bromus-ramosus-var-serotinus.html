<p>Bromus ramosus var. serotinus, commonly known as the late flowering brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, hairless stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spike that blooms later in the growing season compared to other bromes.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
