<p>Begonia peltatifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved begonia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>

The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings.</p>
