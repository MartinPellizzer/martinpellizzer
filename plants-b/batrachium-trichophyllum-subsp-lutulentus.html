<p>Batrachium trichophyllum subsp.</p>
<p>lutulentus, commonly known as the swamp bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic invertebrates.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor waters where it relies on capturing prey to supplement its nutrient intake. Its leaves are submerged, while its stems and roots are often found in the mud.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its ability to thrive in environments where other plants struggle to survive.</p>
