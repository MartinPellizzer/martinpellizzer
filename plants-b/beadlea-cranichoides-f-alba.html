<p>Beadlea cranichoides f. alba, commonly known as the white form of the slender orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats. Its white flowers are notable for their simplicity and lack of showy petals, which is a distinguishing feature of this particular form.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
