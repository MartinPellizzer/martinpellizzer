                    <h1>Brassica barrelieri var. papillaris</h1>
<p>Brassica barrelieri var. papillaris, commonly known as the papillate mustard, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellow flowers and pungent, mustard-like odor, typical of the Brassicaceae family. The leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in small, raised bumps called papillae, which give the plant its specific name. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, along roadsides, and in dry, sunny areas.</p>
<p>This plant is also valued for its potential in phytoremediation due to its ability to accumulate heavy metals.</p>
