                    <h1>Buxus sempervirens var. fruticosa</h1>
<p>Buxus sempervirens var. fruticosa, commonly known as the dense boxwood, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense, dark green foliage that is highly prized for its ability to be shaped into intricate forms. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and durability, it is often used in topiary and ornamental landscaping.</p>
