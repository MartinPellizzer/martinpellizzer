<p>It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that becomes fissured with age, distinguishing it from other birch species. The tree produces small, fluffy seeds enclosed in cone-like structures, which are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are triangular with serrated edges and turn yellow in the autumn.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in boreal and temperate forest ecosystems.</p>
