                    <h1>Boivinella glomerulifera</h1>
<p>Boivinella glomerulifera, commonly known as the clustered leaf cactus, is a succulent plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rounded shape and dense clusters of fleshy, spiny stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Boivinella glomerulifera is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
