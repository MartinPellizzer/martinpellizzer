<p>Berberis dictyophylla var. campylogyna, commonly known as the narrow-leaved barberry, is a shrub native to eastern Asia, particularly China.</p>
<p>It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but tart. Its thorny stems and compact growth habit make it suitable for hedging or ornamental use in gardens.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
