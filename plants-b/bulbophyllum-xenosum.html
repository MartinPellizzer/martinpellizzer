                    <h1>Bulbophyllum xenosum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum xenosum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and its ability to thrive in low-light conditions, often growing epiphytically on trees. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of ghostly forms, hence its common name. It has a complex symbiotic relationship with specific fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Bulbophyllum xenosum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
