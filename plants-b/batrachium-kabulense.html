                    <h1>Batrachium kabulense</h1>
<p>Batrachium kabulense, commonly known as the Kabul frog plant, is a rare and unique member of the Araliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Afghanistan and is characterized by its distinctive, frog-like appearance due to its swollen, fleshy stems. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often clustered in umbels, followed by dark, berry-like fruits. It thrives in cool, shaded environments and requires well-drained, moist soil to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
