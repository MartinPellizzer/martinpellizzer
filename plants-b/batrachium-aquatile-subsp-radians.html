<p>Batrachium aquatile subsp.</p>
<p>radians, commonly known as the aquatic frog plant, is a rare aquatic fern native to specific regions of South America. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes, where it attaches to submerged substrates.</p>
<p>The plant's fronds are typically elongated and ribbon-like, with a distinctive marginal spore-producing structure called a sorus. Its reproductive cycle involves the release of spores into the water, facilitating dispersal to new habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
