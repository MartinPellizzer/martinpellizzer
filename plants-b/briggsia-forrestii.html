<p>Briggsia forrestii, commonly known as the Forest's bristle fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Briggsia forrestii is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
