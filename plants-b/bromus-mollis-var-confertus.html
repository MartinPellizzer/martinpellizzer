                    <h1>Bromus mollis var. confertus</h1>
<p>Bromus mollis var. confertus, commonly known as the dense brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairy stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in a loose panicle, with each spikelet containing several small, two-lobed flowers. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, with a bluish-green color that distinguishes it from other brome species.</p>
<p>This grass is often found in disturbed soils and is commonly used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
