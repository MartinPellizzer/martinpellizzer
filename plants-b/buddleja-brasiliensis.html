<p>Buddleja brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian butterfly bush, is a deciduous shrub native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces showy, spire-like inflorescences of pale purple to white flowers, which attract a variety of pollinators, including butterflies and bees. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>Buddleja brasiliensis is often used in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
