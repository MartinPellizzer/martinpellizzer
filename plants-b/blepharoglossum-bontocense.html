                <h1>Blepharoglossum bontocense</h1>
<p>Blepharoglossum bontocense, commonly known as the Bontoc fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in montane forests at elevations above 1,000 meters. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are arranged in a distinctive linear pattern on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
