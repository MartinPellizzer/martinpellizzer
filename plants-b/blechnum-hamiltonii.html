<p>Blechnum hamiltonii, commonly known as the Hamilton's holly fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories, and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to spread and form dense clumps.</p>
<p>The fronds are pinnately compound, with lance-shaped pinnae that are often slightly curled at the edges.</p>
