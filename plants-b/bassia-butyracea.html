<p>Bassia butyracea, commonly known as buttercup grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and the ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution across its native range.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its potential in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
