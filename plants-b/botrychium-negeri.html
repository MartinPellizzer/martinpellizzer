                    <h1>Botrychium negeri</h1>
<p>Botrychium negeri, commonly known as the black fern or night fern, is a small, delicate fern species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Osmundaceae and is characterized by its unique, clustered fronds that resemble a cluster of grapes, hence its genus name "Botrychium.". The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and swampy areas. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, and it produces both spores and seeds, making it a heterosporous fern.</p>
<p>Botrychium negeri is often found in association with other moisture-loving plants, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>
