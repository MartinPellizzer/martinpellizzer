                    <h1>Bulbophyllum heldiorum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum heldiorum, commonly known as the Malayan ghost orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
