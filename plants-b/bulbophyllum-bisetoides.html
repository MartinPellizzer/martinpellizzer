The plant produces striking, pale green to yellow flowers with intricate markings, often resembling ghostly apparitions. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture from the air and decaying organic matter.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is classified as critically endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
