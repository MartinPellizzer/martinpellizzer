                    <h1>Betula verrucosa var. oycowiensis</h1>
<p>Betula verrucosa var. oycowiensis, commonly known as the Ocyowian birch, is a rare variant of the paper birch found in specific regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive bark, which is white and peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a unique appearance. The leaves are alternate, triangular, and have serrated margins, typical of the Betula genus. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in boreal or temperate forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>This variant is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance.</p>
