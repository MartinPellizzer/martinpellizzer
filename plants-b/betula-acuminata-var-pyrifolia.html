                    <h1>Betula acuminata var. pyrifolia</h1>
<p>Betula acuminata var. pyrifolia, commonly known as the Chinese birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by triangular, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and oval-shaped, turning yellow in the fall.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic bark and seasonal foliage changes.</p>
