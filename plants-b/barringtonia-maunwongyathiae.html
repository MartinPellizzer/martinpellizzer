<p>Barringtonia maunwongyathiae, commonly known as the Maunwongyathia's candlewood, is a rare and endemic species native to the tropical rainforests of northern Thailand.</p>
<p>It is a medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its smooth, pale bark and distinctive, candle-like inflorescences that hang from the branches. The flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female structures, and are pollinated by nocturnal insects such as moths. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
