                    <h1>Betula vladimirii</h1>
<p>Betula vladimirii, commonly known as Vladimir's birch, is a rare and ancient species of birch native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and white, peeling bark that resembles that of the paper birch. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers and oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in cold, high-altitude environments and is adapted to poor, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Betula vladimirii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
