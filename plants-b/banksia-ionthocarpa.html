                    <h1>Banksia ionthocarpa</h1>
<p>Banksia ionthocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, woody cones that remain closed for many years before opening to release seeds. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, which are a key feature of the genus Banksia. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white or greyish hairs.</p>
<p>Banksia ionthocarpa is adapted to fire-prone environments and plays an important role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
