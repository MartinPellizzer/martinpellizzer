                    <h1>Bromelia sagenaria</h1>
<p>Bromelia sagenaria, commonly known as the red-tipped bromeliad, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves that form a rosette shape, creating a central reservoir to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, often with a yellow or green bract. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Bromelia sagenaria is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
