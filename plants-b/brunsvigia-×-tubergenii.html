                    <h1>Brunsvigia × tubergenii</h1>
<p>Brunsvigia × tubergenii, commonly known as the hybrid firecracker lily, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Brunsvigia bicolor and Brunsvigia × rubra.</p>
<p>It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its striking, tubular red or orange flowers that resemble firecrackers, hence its common name. The plant produces large, fleshy bulbs that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to botanical collections and gardens.</p>
