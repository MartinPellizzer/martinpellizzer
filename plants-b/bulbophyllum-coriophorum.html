                    <h1>Bulbophyllum coriophorum</h1>
<p>Bulbophyllum coriophorum, commonly known as the Coriophorum orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth. The plant produces small, clustered pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in less fertile soils. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, this species is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
