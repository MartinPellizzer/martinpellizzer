<p>Hypolepis viridula, commonly known as the green fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and often have a waxy coating. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively, making it a common sight in humid, tropical habitats.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
