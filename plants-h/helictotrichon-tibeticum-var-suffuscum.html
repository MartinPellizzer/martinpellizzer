                    <h1>Helictotrichon tibeticum var. suffuscum</h1>
<p>Helictotrichon tibeticum var. suffuscum, commonly known as the Tibetan hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hair-like leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to the extreme conditions of its alpine habitat.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological significance in high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
