                    <h1>Haworthia hastata</h1>
<p>Haworthia hastata, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves that are often marked with distinct white or yellow markings resembling a zebra's stripes. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves. It produces small, white or pink flowers on slender stems during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Haworthia hastata is popular as a low-maintenance houseplant due to its ability to thrive in bright, indirect light and minimal watering.</p>
