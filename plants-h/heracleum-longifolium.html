                    <h1>Heracleum longifolium</h1>
<p>Heracleum longifolium, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a tall, herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features large, deeply lobed leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter, with a distinctive hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers arranged in an umbrella-like inflorescence, which bloom in late summer. Its stem is thick, hollow, and covered in reddish spots and coarse hairs.</p>
<p>It is important to note that all parts of the plant contain phototoxic sap, making it potentially harmful to skin when exposed to sunlight.</p>
