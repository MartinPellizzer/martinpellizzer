<p>Hypochaeris incana var. integrifolia, commonly known as the hairy false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and bright yellow composite flowers that resemble dandelions. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, allowing it to spread easily.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and garden settings.</p>
