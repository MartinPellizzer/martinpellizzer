                    <h1>Hordeum utriculatum</h1>
<p>Hordeum utriculatum, commonly known as the bur wheat or prickly wheat, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescence and the presence of bracts that often have hooked tips, aiding in seed dispersal by attachment to animals. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is often considered a weed. Its small, cylindrical grains are enclosed in tough, leathery husks, which provide protection against environmental stress.</p>
<p>Hordeum utriculatum is also valued for its role in ecological studies due to its adaptability and reproductive strategies.</p>
