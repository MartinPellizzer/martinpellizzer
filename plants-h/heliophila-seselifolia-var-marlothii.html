                    <h1>Heliophila seselifolia var. marlothii</h1>
<p>Heliophila seselifolia var. marlothii, commonly known as the marlothii heliophila, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>
