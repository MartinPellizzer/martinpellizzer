<p>Hypodematium crenatum subsp.</p>
<p>fauriei, commonly known as the Faurie's hairy shield fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy fronds that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a unique appearance.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity and indirect light. Its reproductive structures are concealed within the leaf axils, a feature common among many ferns, and it relies on spore dispersal for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
