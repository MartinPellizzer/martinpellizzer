                            <h1>Hieracium Angustatum</h1>
<p>Hieracium angustatum, commonly known as narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy stems. This plant often grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its small, lance-shaped leaves and compact growth habit make it easily identifiable in the wild. Despite its modest appearance, Hieracium angustatum plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance.</p>
