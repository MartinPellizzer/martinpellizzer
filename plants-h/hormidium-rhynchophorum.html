                    <h1>Hormidium rhynchophorum</h1>
<p>Hormidium rhynchophorum, commonly known as the horned bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rootless, floating stems and specialized bladder-like structures used for capturing small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are simple and often covered in fine, hair-like structures that aid in water retention.</p>
<p>Hormidium rhynchophorum is a carnivorous plant, relying on its bladders to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor waters.</p>
