                    <h1>Hayekia</h1>
<p>Hayekia, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Hayekia produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping in drought-prone landscapes.</p>
