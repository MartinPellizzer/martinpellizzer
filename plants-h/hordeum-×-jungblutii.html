                    <h1>Hordeum × jungblutii</h1>
<p>Hordeum × jungblutii, commonly known as hybrid barley, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Hordeum spontaneum and Hordeum vulgare.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intermediate morphological traits, combining features of both parent species. This plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural areas where barley is cultivated. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a genetic resource for breeding programs aimed at improving barley varieties.</p>
<p>The species is also of interest in ecological studies due to its adaptability and potential for hybridization.</p>
