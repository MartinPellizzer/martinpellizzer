<p>Hieracium vulgatum var. paralium is a common dandelion-like plant found in meadows and grassy areas across europe. it belongs to the asteraceae family and is known for its yellow flowers and fuzzy leaves. this variant is often mistaken for the common dandelion but has distinct features such as its smaller size and different leaf shape. it thrives in moist soils and is often seen in late spring and early summer. despite its simple appearance, it plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and ecosystems.</p>
