                    <h1>Hydrocotyle petiolaris</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle petiolaris, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water shield, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has floating leaves with a waxy cuticle that helps it remain buoyant and reduce water loss. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in the summer and are followed by small, round fruits.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle petiolaris plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
