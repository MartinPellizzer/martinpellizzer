                    <h1>Hexalectris</h1>
<p>Hexalectris, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a genus of flowering plants native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their lack of leaves and their unique, often showy flowers that resemble orchids. They are typically found growing on the branches of longleaf pines in wet, shaded habitats. Hexalectris species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>Their conservation status is threatened due to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
