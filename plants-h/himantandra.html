                    <h1>Himantandra</h1>
<p>Himantandra, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to three meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still or slow-moving water. The plant's flowers are showy, with white petals that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Himantandra has a thick, spongy stem that helps it remain buoyant and anchored in the water.</p>
<p>Its unique botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts.</p>
