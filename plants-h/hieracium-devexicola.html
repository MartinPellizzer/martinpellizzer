<p>Hieracium devexicola, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically has hairy stems and leaves that are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings.</p>
