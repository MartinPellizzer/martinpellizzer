<p>Hordeum polystichon var. hackelii, commonly known as the Hackel's barleygrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments.</p>
