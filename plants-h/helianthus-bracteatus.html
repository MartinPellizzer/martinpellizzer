                    <h1>Helianthus bracteatus</h1>
<p>Helianthus bracteatus, commonly known as the bracted sunflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features upright stems with yellow-orange ray florets and dark brown disk florets, typical of the sunflower genus. The plant produces bracts—leaf-like structures—that are often mistaken for leaves but are actually modified leaves surrounding the flower head. Its growth habit is characterized by a single stem with few branches, and it typically reaches heights of 1 to 3 meters.</p>
<p>Helianthus bracteatus is adapted to moist, sunny habitats and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>
