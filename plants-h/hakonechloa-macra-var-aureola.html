                    <h1>Hakonechloa macra var. aureola</h1>
<p>Hakonechloa macra var. aureola, commonly known as Japanese forest grass, is a compact, clump-forming evergreen perennial that thrives in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Its foliage is characterized by narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive golden or variegated edge, creating a striking visual contrast. The plant produces delicate, upright spikes of small, pale green to white flowers in late spring to early summer. It is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and low maintenance requirements, it is well-suited for rock gardens and as a ground cover in shaded areas.</p>
