                    <h1>Holcus fragrans</h1>
<p>Holcus fragrans, commonly known as sweetgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and fine, silky leaves that emit a subtle, sweet fragrance when crushed. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing small, pale green to brown spikelets that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Sweetgrass is often used in traditional crafts, such as basket weaving, and has a long history of cultural and medicinal significance.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to various soil types and moderate climate conditions makes it a common sight in meadows and along woodland edges.</p>
