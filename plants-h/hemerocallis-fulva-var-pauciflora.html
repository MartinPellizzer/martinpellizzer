                    <h1>Hemerocallis fulva var. pauciflora</h1>
<p>Hemerocallis fulva var. pauciflora, commonly known as the lesser daylily, is a variant of the daylily species native to Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its sword-shaped, grass-like leaves. The plant produces showy, orange-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Unlike the more common Hemerocallis fulva, this variety has fewer flowers per stem, hence its name.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy and low-maintenance ornamental plant.</p>
