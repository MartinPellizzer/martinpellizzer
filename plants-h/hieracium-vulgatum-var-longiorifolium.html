                    <h1>Hieracium vulgatum var. longiorifolium</h1>
<p>Hieracium vulgatum var. longiorifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of lanceolate leaves that are longer and more slender than those of the typical *H. vulgatum*. The plant produces yellow flowers in a single head, surrounded by a ring of pale green to white bracts. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed in agricultural and natural settings.</p>
