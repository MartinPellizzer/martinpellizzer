<p>Huernia namaquensis, commonly known as the Namaqua ice plant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically blue-green and covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Huernia namaquensis is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements.</p>
