                    <h1>Huernia echidnopsioides</h1>
<p>Huernia echidnopsioides, commonly known as the elephant's foot cactus, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a distinctive, swollen, branching stem that resembles an elephant's foot, which stores water for drought periods. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces yellow to orange flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
