                    <h1>Horridocactus engleri var. krausii</h1>
<p>Horridocactus engleri var. krausii, commonly known as the Kraus's horridocactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white or pale-colored hairs. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne in clusters at the stem tips. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species in botanical collections.</p>
