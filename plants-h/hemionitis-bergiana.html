                    <h1>Hemionitis bergiana</h1>
<p>Hemionitis bergiana, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are thick and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight.</p>
<p>Hemionitis bergiana is often found in rocky and mountainous habitats, thriving in cold and dry conditions.</p>
