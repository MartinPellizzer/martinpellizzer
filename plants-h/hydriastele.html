                    <h1>Hydriastele</h1>
<p>Hydriastele, commonly known as the water star, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Bromeliaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to South America, particularly Brazil, and are adapted to grow in moist, shaded environments. Hydriastele species are characterized by their rosette-shaped leaves that form a central pool to collect water. The flowers are typically small and clustered, often in a spadix-like structure.</p>
<p>They play an important role in their ecosystems by providing habitat and moisture retention in humid forest understories.</p>
