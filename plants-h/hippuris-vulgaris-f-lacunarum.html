<p>Hippuris vulgaris f. lacunarum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water-plantain, is a variant of the water-plantain species characterized by its narrower leaves.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and the edges of ponds. The plant has a rhizomatous root system and produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Its leaves are typically linear and have a distinct midrib, which is more pronounced in this form.</p>
<p>This botanical feature contributes to its identification and ecological role in aquatic habitats.</p>
