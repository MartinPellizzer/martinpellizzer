                    <h1>Haloragis fruticosa</h1>
<p>Haloragis fruticosa, commonly known as the coastal flax or beach flax, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found along shorelines and dunes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, and it has narrow, grass-like leaves that help reduce water loss. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds, making it an important species for stabilizing dune ecosystems.</p>
<p>Haloragis fruticosa is also used in traditional medicine by local communities for its potential health benefits.</p>
