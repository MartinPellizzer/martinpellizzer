                    <h1>Hydnocarpus serratus</h1>
<p>Hydnocarpus serratus, commonly known as the African blackwood, is a tropical tree native to Africa and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, dense wood and distinctive serrated leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits containing flat, kidney-shaped seeds. It is often found in moist, lowland forests and is valued for its hard, durable timber.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions.</p>
