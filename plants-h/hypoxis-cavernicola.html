                    <h1>Hypoxis cavernicola</h1>
<p>Hypoxis cavernicola, commonly known as the cave hypoxis, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It is often found growing in crevices or under rocks in shaded, humid microhabitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species.</p>
