                    <h1>Hohenbergia catingae var. catingae</h1>
<p>Hohenbergia catingae var. catingae, commonly known as the Catinga Hohenbergia, is a unique bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery bloom. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped inflorescences with bright red bracts that contrast beautifully with its foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings.</p>
