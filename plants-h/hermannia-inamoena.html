                    <h1>Hermannia inamoena</h1>
<p>Hermannia inamoena, commonly known as the red-eyed cycad, is a unique plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with the female cones being particularly striking due to their bright red color. Hermannia inamoena is adapted to arid environments and requires well-drained soil and minimal water.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
