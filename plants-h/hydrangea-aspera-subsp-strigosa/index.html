                            <h1>Hydrangea Aspera Subsp. Strigosa</h1>
<p>Hydrangea aspera subsp. strigosa is a rare and striking member of the Hydrangeaceae family known for its unique foliage and floral characteristics. Native to the mountainous regions of East Asia, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade. Its leaves are densely covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture and a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink depending on soil pH. Despite its beauty, it remains relatively obscure in horticultural circles due to its limited distribution and specific growing requirements.</p>
