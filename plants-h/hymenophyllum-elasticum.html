                    <h1>Hymenophyllum elasticum</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum elasticum, commonly known as the elastic hymenophyllum, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that can be stretched and then return to their original shape, giving it its common name. The plant has a compact growth habit with closely spaced, linear leaves that form a dense mat. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum elasticum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in humid forests.</p>
