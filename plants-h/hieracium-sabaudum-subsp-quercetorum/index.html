                            <h1>Hieracium Sabaudum Subsp. Quercetorum</h1>
<p>Hieracium sabaudum subsp. quercetorum is a lesser-known member of the dandelion family known for its delicate yellow flowers and unique ecological role. This subspecies thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found near woodlands and along stream banks. Its leaves are typically more elongated and less hairy compared to other Hieracium species. The plant plays an important part in supporting local pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in its habitat. Due to its subtle appearance, it is often overlooked despite its ecological significance.</p>
