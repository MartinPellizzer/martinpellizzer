<p>Horridocactus paucicostatus subsp.</p>
<p>floccosus, commonly known as the woolly hedgehog cactus, is a unique cactus species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems covered in dense, white, woolly hairs that give it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a striking contrast to its fuzzy foliage. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the cactus family.</p>
