<p>Hedyotis fruticulosa var. yapensis, commonly known as the Yap hedyotis, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, particularly the island of Yap.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its small, opposite leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its fruits are small capsules that release seeds when mature, contributing to its propagation in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>
