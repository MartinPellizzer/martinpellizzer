                    <h1>Hymenasplenium speluncicola</h1>
<p>Hymenasplenium speluncicola, commonly known as the cave spleenwort, is a rare and specialized fern that thrives in dark, humid cave environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pterobryaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that are adapted to low-light conditions. The plant is epiphytic, growing on the surfaces of cave walls or rock formations rather than in soil. Its unique morphology includes a short, creeping stem and specialized structures for water absorption in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for cave ecosystems.</p>
