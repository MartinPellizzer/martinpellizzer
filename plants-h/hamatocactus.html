<p>Hamatocactus, commonly known as the Mexican hat cactus, is a genus of cacti native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that often branch into a crown of cylindrical, ribbed segments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom at the top of the stem during the spring and summer months. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Hamatocactus species are often cultivated for their striking appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
