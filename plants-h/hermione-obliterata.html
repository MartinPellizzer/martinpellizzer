                    <h1>Hermione obliterata</h1>
<p>Hermione obliterata, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the temperate regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, Hermione obliterata is considered a conservation concern in its native habitats.</p>
