                    <h1>Hornstedtia ophiuchus</h1>
<p>Hornstedtia ophiuchus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often clustered at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
