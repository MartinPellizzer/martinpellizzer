                            <h1>Hieracium Lanosiceps</h1>
<p>Lanose hawkweed, scientifically known as Hieracium lanosiceps, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the dandelion family, Asteraceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and yellow flowers. This species is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it has become a subject of ecological concern. Despite its ornamental appeal, its spread can disrupt native plant communities and biodiversity.</p>
