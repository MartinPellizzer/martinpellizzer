<p>Helwingia himalaica var. gracilipes, commonly known as the slender helwingia, is a rare and delicate shrub native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, oval-shaped berries. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas at elevations above 2,500 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
