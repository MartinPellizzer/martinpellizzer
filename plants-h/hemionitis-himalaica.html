                    <h1>Hemionitis himalaica</h1>
<p>Hemionitis himalaica, commonly known as the Himalayan hemionitis, is a rare and delicate fern native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hemionitidaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a thin layer of whitish or brownish powdery bloom. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in rocky crevices or among mosses at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemionitis himalaica is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental changes in alpine ecosystems.</p>
