                    <h1>Hydnophytum formicarum var. borneense</h1>
<p>Hydnophytum formicarum var. borneense, commonly known as the ant plant, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It forms a hollow, cup-like structure on its stem that serves as a home for ants, which in turn protect the plant from herbivores. The plant's morphology includes a dense network of roots and a specialized leaf that secretes nectar to attract ants. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees in the understory of tropical forests.</p>
<p>Its symbiotic relationship with ants is a key feature of its ecological niche.</p>
