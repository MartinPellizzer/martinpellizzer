                    <h1>Herpestis lanigera var. marginata</h1>
<p>Herpestis lanigera var. marginata, commonly known as the marginated sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial with succulent, fleshy stems that store water, aiding its survival in dry environments. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, woolly coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its distinctive margins, which are often marked with a contrasting color.</p>
