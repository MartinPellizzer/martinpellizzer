                    <h1>Heracleum cinereum</h1>
<p>Heracleum cinereum, commonly known as cow parsnip, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, umbrella-shaped compound leaves.</p>
<p>It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in complex umbels, which are typical of the carrot family. The plant is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs and have a distinctive, aromatic scent when crushed.</p>
<p>Heracleum cinereum is considered a weed in some regions but is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>
