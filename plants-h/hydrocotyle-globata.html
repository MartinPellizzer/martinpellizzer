<p>Hydrocotyle globata, commonly known as the globe willow or water buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of rounded, glossy, light green leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in diameter. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist soils.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle globata is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams where it thrives in saturated conditions.</p>
