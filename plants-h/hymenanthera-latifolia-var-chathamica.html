The plant produces woody, cone-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is adapted to the cool, maritime climate of its native habitat and is often found in coastal scrub or rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
