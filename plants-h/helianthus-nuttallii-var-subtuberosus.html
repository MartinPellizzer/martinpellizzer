                    <h1>Helianthus nuttallii var. subtuberosus</h1>
<p>Helianthus nuttallii var. subtuberosus, commonly known as Nuttall's sunflower, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, branching stem and large, yellow-orange composite flower heads. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with rough, hairy surfaces and produces numerous tubular florets that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in open woods and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure supports its role as a wildflower and a potential candidate for ecological restoration projects.</p>
