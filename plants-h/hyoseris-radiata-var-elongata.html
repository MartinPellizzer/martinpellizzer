<p>Hyoseris radiata var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated helianthus, is a variant of the helianthus genus native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, rocky soils, often found in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant features elongated, narrow leaves and produces yellow flowers that resemble those of the sunflower. It has a compact growth habit and is well adapted to survive in harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for study in xerophytic plant adaptations.</p>
