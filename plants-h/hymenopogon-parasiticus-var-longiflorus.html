                    <h1>Hymenopogon parasiticus var. longiflorus</h1>
<p>Hymenopogon parasiticus var. longiflorus, commonly known as the long-flowered parasitic grass, is a hemiparasitic plant that relies on host plants for some of its nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It possesses slender, creeping stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of elongated, pale green to yellowish flowers, which are typically arranged in spike-like inflorescences. It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
