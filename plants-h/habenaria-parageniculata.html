                    <h1>Habenaria parageniculata</h1>
<p>Habenaria parageniculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Korean Peninsula.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands, where it thrives in the presence of mycorrhizal fungi. The plant features slender, upright stems with lance-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, narrow spur. Its root system is adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions.</p>
