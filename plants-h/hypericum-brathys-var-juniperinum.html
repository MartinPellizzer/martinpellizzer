<p>Hypericum brathys var. juniperinum, commonly known as the Juniper-like St. John's Wort, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs. Its bark is reddish-brown and becomes fissured with age, while its stems are somewhat woody and aromatic.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to other Hypericum species and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties.</p>
