                    <h1>Hoodia foetida</h1>
<p>Hoodia foetida, commonly known as the desert cactus or Hoodia, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spineless, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Hoodia foetida has gained attention for its potential appetite-suppressing properties, though its ecological role and conservation status remain important areas of study.</p>
