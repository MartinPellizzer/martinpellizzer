                    <h1>Hesperostipa comata</h1>
<p>Hesperostipa comata, commonly known as the hairy needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, tufted inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates with hot, dry summers. Its leaves are hairy, giving it the common name, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments.</p>
<p>Hesperostipa comata is often found in open woodlands, grasslands, and along coastal areas.</p>
