<p>Heliophila graminea, commonly known as marsh woundwort, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in spikes. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and establish in wet environments.</p>
<p>Heliophila graminea is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems.</p>
