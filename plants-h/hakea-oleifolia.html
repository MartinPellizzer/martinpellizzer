                    <h1>Hakea oleifolia</h1>
<p>Hakea oleifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces striking clusters of bright red, urn-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. It is well adapted to dry climates and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Hakea oleifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in native gardens.</p>
