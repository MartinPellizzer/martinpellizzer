<p>Hymenophyllum zeelandicum, commonly known as the Zeeland fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, delicate epiphytic plant that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in shaded, humid environments. The fronds are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered with tiny, scale-like structures called trichomes. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a membranous cover called a indusium.</p>
<p>This plant is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
