<p>Hieracium grandidens, commonly known as the giant hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features upright, hairy stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. Its showy yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
