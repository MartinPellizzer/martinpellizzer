                            <h1>Hakea Dumetorum</h1>
<p>Coastal hakea, scientifically known as Hakea dumetorum, is a unique shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and dunes along the coastline. This plant is notable for its striking foliage, featuring narrow, needle-like leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions. Its flowering spikes produce clusters of pink or red flowers, attracting native pollinators and adding visual interest to the landscape. Despite its resilience, Coastal hakea is considered vulnerable due to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
