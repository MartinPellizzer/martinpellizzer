<p>Hirculus egregius, commonly known as the celestial horned orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spiraling inflorescence and vibrant, iridescent petals that shift in color under different light conditions. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-draining soil, often growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded forest clearings. Its flowers emit a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators, such as certain species of moths and bees.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to climate change, Hirculus egregius is classified as an endangered species.</p>
