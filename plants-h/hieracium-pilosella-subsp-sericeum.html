<p>Hieracium pilosella subsp.</p>
<p>sericeum, commonly known as the silky hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, flat-topped clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and invasive tendencies in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural or natural habitats.</p>
