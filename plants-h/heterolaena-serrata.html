                    <h1>Heterolaena serrata</h1>
<p>Heterolaena serrata, commonly known as the serrated heterolaena, is a flowering plant species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its erect, often branched stems and lanceolate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which are followed by small, dry fruits called schizocarps. Heterolaena serrata is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands, and it is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology.</p>
