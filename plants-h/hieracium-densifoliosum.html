<p>Hieracium densifoliosum, commonly known as the dense-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, dark green leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. The plant thrives in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. It has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread readily.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
