                    <h1>Hymenophyllum revolutum</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum revolutum, commonly known as the revolute filmy fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the world.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant's leaves are thin and translucent, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in humid environments. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as forest floors and tree canopies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in small, clustered structures called sori.</p>
