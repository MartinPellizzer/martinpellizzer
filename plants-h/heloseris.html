<p>Heloseris, commonly known as the water lily, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Nychthemeral.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their floating leaves and showy, often fragrant flowers that open during the day and close at night. Heloseris species typically thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Their roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of water bodies, while their leaves float on the surface.</p>
<p>The flowers of Heloseris play an important role in attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
