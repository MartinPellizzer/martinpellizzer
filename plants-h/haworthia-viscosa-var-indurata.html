                    <h1>Haworthia viscosa var. indurata</h1>
<p>Haworthia viscosa var. indurata, commonly known as the thick-leaved Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, fleshy, pale green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, giving them a somewhat sticky texture. The leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern and can develop a bluish or reddish hue when exposed to full sun. It produces small, white, star-shaped flowers on slender stems during the summer months.</p>
<p>This species is well-suited for rock gardens and container cultivation due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance.</p>
