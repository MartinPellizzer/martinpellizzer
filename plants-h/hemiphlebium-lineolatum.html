<p>Hemiphlebium lineolatum, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that create a cascading effect, often resembling a delicate lace. The plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments and is typically found in rocky or forested areas. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a prized specimen in botanical gardens and conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in the wild.</p>
