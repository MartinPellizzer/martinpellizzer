                    <h1>Hemisorghum mekongense</h1>
<p>Hemisorghum mekongense, commonly known as Mekong sorghum, is a perennial grass native to Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam and Cambodia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, robust stalks and large, feather-like leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in wetland and riparian environments, often growing along riverbanks and in marshy areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Hemisorghum mekongense is also valued for its potential in phytoremediation due to its ability to tolerate and absorb heavy metals from contaminated soils.</p>
