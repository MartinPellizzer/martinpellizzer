                    <h1>Heracleum brunonis</h1>
<p>Heracleum brunonis, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a tall, coarse-stemmed plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features large, umbrella-like compound leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, with a hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in late summer, which are followed by spiky, brown seed pods. Its sap contains phototoxic compounds that can cause severe skin irritation when exposed to sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions.</p>
