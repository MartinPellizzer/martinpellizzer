<p>Hutchinsia alpina subsp.</p>
<p>polatschekii, commonly known as the alpine hutchinsia, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, hairy foliage, and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale pink.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing on rocky slopes or in alpine meadows. Its botanical features reflect adaptations to harsh mountain conditions, including frost resistance and efficient water retention.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
