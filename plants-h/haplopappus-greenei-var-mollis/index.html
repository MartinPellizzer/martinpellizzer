                            <h1>Haplopappus Greenei Var. Mollis</h1>
<p>Haplopappus greenei var. mollis is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads and ecological importance. This variant is characterized by its soft, woolly foliage and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Conservation efforts are crucial to preserving this unique plant in its natural environment.</p>
