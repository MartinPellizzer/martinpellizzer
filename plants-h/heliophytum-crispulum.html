                    <h1>Heliophytum crispulum</h1>
<p>Heliophytum crispulum, commonly known as the silverleaf heliophytum, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, silver-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun exposure to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
