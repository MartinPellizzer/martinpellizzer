                    <h1>Hoya acuta</h1>
<p>Hoya acuta, commonly known as the sharp hoya, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of star-shaped, waxy flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, or red. The plant produces a milky sap, which is a common feature among many species in the Hoya genus. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Hoya acuta is popular among houseplant enthusiasts for its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
