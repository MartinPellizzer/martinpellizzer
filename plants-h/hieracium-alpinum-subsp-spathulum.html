<p>Hieracium alpinum subsp.</p>
<p>spathulum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosette of leaves, which are typically covered in fine, white pubescence.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in high-altitude environments where few plants can survive.</p>
