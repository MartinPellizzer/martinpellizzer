                    <h1>Heliophila aggregata</h1>
<p>Heliophila aggregata, commonly known as the clustered heliophyte, is a flowering plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing pink or purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often growing in dense mats that help stabilize the soil in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Heliophila aggregata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions.</p>
