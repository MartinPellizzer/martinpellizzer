<p>Hederorkis scandederis, commonly known as the Scandia sea squirt, is a marine invertebrate belonging to the class Ascidiacea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its sac-like body and tunic, which is a thick, protective layer composed of a complex matrix of proteins and polysaccharides. The plant, or more accurately, the organism, is filter feeders that attach to surfaces in coastal waters, using their siphons to draw in water. Its reproductive system involves both sexual and asexual reproduction, with larvae dispersing through the water column.</p>
<p>Hederorkis scandederis plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
