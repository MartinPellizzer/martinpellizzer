<p>Hordeum vulgare subsp.</p>
<p>polystichon, commonly known as wild barley, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender,丛生 growth habit and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is often found in moist or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and it produces achenes as its reproductive structures.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in botanical studies due to its genetic diversity and potential agricultural significance.</p>
