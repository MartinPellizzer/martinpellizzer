                <h1>Hebe carnosula</h1>
<p>Hebe carnosula, commonly known as the fat hebe, is a shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native environment. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, Hebe carnosula is widely cultivated in temperate regions.</p>
