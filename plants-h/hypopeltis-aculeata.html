<p>Hypopeltis aculeata, commonly known as the spiny leaf fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in humid environments. Its leaves are often covered with small, spiny structures that provide protection against herbivores.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, facilitating its reproduction in shaded, moist habitats.</p>
