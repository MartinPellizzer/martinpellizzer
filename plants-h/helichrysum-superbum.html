                    <h1>Helichrysum superbum</h1>
<p>Helichrysum superbum, commonly known as the golden marguerite or everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces clusters of small, yellow to orange flowers that resemble daisies. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and the flowers retain their color for a long time after drying, which is why it is often used in floral arrangements.</p>
<p>Helichrysum superbum is also valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in herbal remedies.</p>
