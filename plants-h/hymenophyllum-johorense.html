<p>Hymenophyllum johorense, commonly known as the Johor moss, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, often hairy leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. This epiphytic plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its fronds are usually bright green and have a velvety texture, which helps in moisture retention.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically clustered on the underside of the leaves.</p>
