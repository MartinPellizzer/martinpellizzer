<p>It features a rosette of fleshy, narrow leaves that are typically light green with white or pale green markings. The leaves are covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, white flowers on a tall stem during the summer months.</p>
<p>This plant is well-suited for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements.</p>
