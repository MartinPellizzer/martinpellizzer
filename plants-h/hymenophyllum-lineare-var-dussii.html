                    <h1>Hymenophyllum lineare var. dussii</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum lineare var. dussii, commonly known as the Dussi's filmy fern, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the Hymenophyllaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The fronds are linear and often recurved, with a finely toothed margin. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, or sporangia, are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of many ferns.</p>
