<p>Hymenophyllum ferrugineum var. donatii, commonly known as the rusty toothed fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures called trichomes. The plant prefers cool, moist environments and is often found growing on the bark of trees or rocks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its reddish-brown coloration on the margins of its fronds.</p>
