                    <h1>Hieracium psammogenes var. obscurisquamum</h1>
<p>Hieracium psammogenes var. obscurisquamum, commonly known as the dark-squamate hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as steppes and coastal areas. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves with a rough, hairy texture, and it produces yellow flowers in elongated inflorescences. Its leaves and stems are covered in small, dark-colored scales, giving it its specific epithet "obscurisquamum.".</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to other hawkweed species but is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and habitat preferences.</p>
