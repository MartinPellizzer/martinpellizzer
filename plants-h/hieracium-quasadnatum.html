<p>Hieracium quasadnatum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its yellow flowers, which bloom in summer, are surrounded by pale green bracts, and it produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Hieracium quasadnatum is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native flora.</p>
