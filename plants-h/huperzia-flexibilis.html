<p>Huperzia flexibilis, commonly known as the flexible huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its wiry, creeping stems that often form dense mats on the forest floor. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically clustered in sori on the underside of its leaves. Huperzia flexibilis is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as temperate forests and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it an important component of many forest ecosystems.</p>
