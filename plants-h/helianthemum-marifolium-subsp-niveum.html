<p>Helianthemum marifolium subsp.</p>
<p>niveum, commonly known as the white rock rose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The plant has silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its pale flowers and compact growth habit compared to other members of the genus.</p>
