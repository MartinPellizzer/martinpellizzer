                    <h1>Hymenophyllum hastatum</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum hastatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the Hymenophyllaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are covered with a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures called trichomes, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are located on the underside of the leaves, contributing to its unique reproductive biology.</p>
