                    <h1>Heliamphora hispida</h1>
<p>Heliamphora hispida, commonly known as the hispid sun pitcher, is a carnivorous plant native to the tepuis of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pitcher-shaped leaves, which are adapted to trap and digest insects. The plant's leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help in the adhesion of prey. It thrives in high-altitude, nutrient-poor environments, making it well-suited for specific ecological niches.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a unique and fascinating subject for both horticultural enthusiasts and scientific study.</p>
