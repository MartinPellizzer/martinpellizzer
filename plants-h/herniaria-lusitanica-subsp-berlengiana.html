<p>Herniaria lusitanica subsp.</p>
<p>berlengiana, commonly known as the Berlenga sandwort, is a small, mat-forming plant native to the western Mediterranean, particularly found on coastal dunes and sandy soils. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with tiny, rounded leaves and clusters of white flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to harsh, saline environments, demonstrating remarkable resilience to wind and salt spray. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats, often on the island of Berlenga, which contributes to its rarity.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some conservation assessments.</p>
