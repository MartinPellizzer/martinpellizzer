                    <h1>Hymenotheca</h1>
<p>Hymenotheca, commonly known as the "hymenothecium," is a specialized structure found in certain flowering plants, particularly in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It refers to the calyx-like structure that develops from the fusion of the sepals and is often modified to enclose the ovary. This structure plays a crucial role in protecting the developing flower and aiding in pollination. The hymenotheca is typically composed of multiple fused tepals, which may be showy and attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its structural adaptation and ecological function in reproductive processes.</p>
