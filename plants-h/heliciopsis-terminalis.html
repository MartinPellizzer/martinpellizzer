<p>Heliciopsis terminalis, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a parasitic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees such as Dipterocarps. The plant has small, clustered leaves and produces yellowish-white flowers that are often fragrant. Its fruits are small berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host if left unchecked, making it a significant concern in forest ecosystems.</p>
