                    <h1>Hapalorchis trilobata</h1>
<p>Hapalorchis trilobata, commonly known as the three-lobed liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, flat, and often lobed thallus that grows on moist, shaded surfaces such as rocks or soil. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead relying on a structure called a thallus for nutrient absorption. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia.</p>
<p>Hapalorchis trilobata is typically found in temperate regions and thrives in humid, cool environments.</p>
