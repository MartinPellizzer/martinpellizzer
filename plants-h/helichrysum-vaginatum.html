<p>Helichrysum vaginatum, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, yellow-orange inflorescences that resemble small sunflowers, which are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rocky or sandy environments. It is often found in open woodlands and along coastal areas, where it benefits from full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Helichrysum vaginatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
