                    <h1>Hemionitis leucopoda</h1>
<p>Hemionitis leucopoda, commonly known as the white-veined fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China and northern Vietnam.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, pale green fronds with distinctive white veins that contrast sharply with its dark green base. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, typical of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemionitis leucopoda is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
