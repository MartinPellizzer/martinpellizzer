<p>Herniaria glabra var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered bladderwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to dry, sandy soils in coastal and inland areas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Crambeae and is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and tiny, clustered flowers. The plant is often found in disturbed or nutrient-poor environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its unique morphology includes bladder-like structures that may aid in water retention.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ability to colonize harsh habitats, contributing to soil stabilization and ecological diversity.</p>
