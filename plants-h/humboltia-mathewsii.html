<p>Humboltia mathewsii, commonly known as the San Diego thornapple, is a flowering plant native to California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its spiny stems and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Humboltia mathewsii thrives in coastal scrub habitats and is adapted to dry, sunny environments.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an important species for ecological studies in its native range.</p>
