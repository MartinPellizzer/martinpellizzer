                    <h1>Hemionitis pteridioides</h1>
<p>Hemionitis pteridioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a rare and delicate aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes, where it forms dense, floating mats. The plant has finely divided, linear leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
