<p>Huegelia cyanea, commonly known as the blue bellflower, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue and violet. The plant's foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Huegelia cyanea thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring through early summer.</p>
