                    <h1>Halophila kotschyanae</h1>
<p>Halophila kotschyanae, commonly known as the Kotschy's sea horsegrass, is a marine flowering plant belonging to the Alismataceae family.</p>
<p>It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments such as shallow coastal waters and estuaries. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. It plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for marine organisms.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to high salinity makes it a key species in intertidal zones.</p>
