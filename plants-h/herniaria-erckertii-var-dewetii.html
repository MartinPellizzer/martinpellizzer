                    <h1>Herniaria erckertii var. dewetii</h1>
<p>Herniaria erckertii var. dewetii, commonly known as the Desert Carpetweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise muted appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and unique morphology, it is a valuable plant for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
