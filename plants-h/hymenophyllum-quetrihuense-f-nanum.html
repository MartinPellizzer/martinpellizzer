                    <h1>Hymenophyllum quetrihuense f. nanum</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum quetrihuense f. nanum, commonly known as the miniature shield fern, is a rare and small epiphytic fern belonging to the Hymenophyllaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Hymenophyllaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
