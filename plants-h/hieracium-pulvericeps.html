<p>Hieracium pulvericeps, commonly known as the powdered hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, pale yellow ray florets surrounded by numerous disk florets, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Hieracium pulvericeps is an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation due to its rapid growth and prolific seed production.</p>
