<p>Hieracium glaucum nothosubsp.</p>
<p>pseudobadense, commonly known as the glaucous hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Central Europe. It typically features basal rosettes of silver-green, hairy leaves and produces small, yellowish to brownish composite flowers.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in dry grasslands, rocky soils, and disturbed habitats. Its morphology is similar to other hawkweeds, but it is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and subtle morphological differences.</p>
<p>It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to soil stabilization.</p>
