<p>Hoya odorata subsp.</p>
<p>loheri, commonly known as the Loher's wax plant, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, emerging from the leaf axils. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
