<p>Hylophila mollis, commonly known as the small water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has delicate, finely divided leaves that float on the water surface, while its roots anchor it to submerged substrates. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its preference for still or gently flowing water.</p>
<p>Hylophila mollis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
