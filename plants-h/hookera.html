                    <h1>Hookera</h1>
<p>Hookera, commonly known as the "mountain holly," is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Ericaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. Hookera species are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their evergreen leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plants thrive in cool, moist environments and are often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to their unique adaptations to high-altitude conditions, Hookera species are of interest to botanists studying plant resilience and evolution.</p>
