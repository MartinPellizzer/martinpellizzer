                    <h1>Heterothalamus acaulis</h1>
<p>Heterothalamus acaulis, commonly known as the naked-stemmed heterothalamus, is a unique species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of a distinct stem, with the plant body consisting primarily of a flat, leaf-like structure known as a thallus. The thallus is usually green and grows close to the ground, often in moist, shaded environments. It exhibits a dimorphic structure, with the upper surface being smooth and the lower surface bearing small, cup-like structures called gemmae.</p>
<p>This plant plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its habitat.</p>
