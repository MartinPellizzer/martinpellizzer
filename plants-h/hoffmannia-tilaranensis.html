                    <h1>Hoffmannia tilaranensis</h1>
<p>Hoffmannia tilaranensis, commonly known as the Tilaran Hoffmania, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, Hoffmannia tilaranensis remains poorly understood and is considered endangered.</p>
