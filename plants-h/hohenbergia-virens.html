                    <h1>Hohenbergia virens</h1>
<p>Hohenbergia virens, commonly known as the green rosette bromeliad, is a perennial plant native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright red bracts that contrast sharply with its foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Hohenbergia virens is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
