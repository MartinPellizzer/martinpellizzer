                    <h1>Herzogia</h1>
<p>Herzogia, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their compact, mat-forming growth habit and their showy, bell-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors. The leaves are typically small, hairy, and adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Herzogia species are often found in rocky soils and are well-suited to harsh, semi-desert conditions.</p>
<p>They play an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in their native habitats.</p>
