                    <h1>Hancea spinulosa</h1>
<p>Hancea spinulosa, commonly known as the spiky hancea, is a shrub native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, round, yellow fruits that are edible but often overlooked due to the plant's defensive spines. Hancea spinulosa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in understorey layers of tropical forests.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology makes it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation.</p>
