                <h1>Hemionitis praetermissa</h1>
<p>Hemionitis praetermissa, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, typically found in forest understories or rocky crevices. The plant has finely divided, delicate fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. It is characterized by its unique reproductive structures, including small, spore-bearing cones.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Hemionitis praetermissa is considered endangered and is often difficult to cultivate outside its natural range.</p>
