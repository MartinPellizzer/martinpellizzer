                    <h1>Hordeum bulbosum var. lycium</h1>
<p>Hordeum bulbosum var. lycium, commonly known as wild barley, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, bulbous base and slender, erect stems that bear spikelets with small, awned grains. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and along stream banks, and is adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>This species is of interest in botanical studies due to its genetic diversity and potential agricultural value.</p>
