<p>Hieracium viscosum subsp.</p>
<p>lactucoides, commonly known as the sticky hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, glandular leaves and stems that bear yellow disk flowers with numerous ray florets.</p>
<p>The plant produces a milky latex when damaged, which is a common feature among the genus Hieracium. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas.</p>
