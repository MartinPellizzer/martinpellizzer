<p>Helictotrichon alpinum subsp.</p>
<p>adsurgens, commonly known as the alpine hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender,丛生 growth habit and fine, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability to extreme climates, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
