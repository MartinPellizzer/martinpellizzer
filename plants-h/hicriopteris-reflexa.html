<p>Hicriopteris reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often submerged or floating. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Hicriopteris reflexa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis.</p>
