<p>Herorchis coriophora subsp.</p>
<p>fragrans, commonly known as the fragrant marsh orchid, is a perennial herb native to wetland and marsh environments in Europe. It produces showy, pale green to yellowish flowers with a distinctive, fragrant scent that attracts pollinators such as bees and flies.</p>
<p>The plant has a compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a short, erect flowering stem. It thrives in nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils and is often found in peat bogs and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>The subspecies fragrans is distinguished by its stronger fragrance compared to other subspecies of Herorchis coriophora.</p>
