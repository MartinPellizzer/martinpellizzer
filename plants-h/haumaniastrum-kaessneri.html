<p>Haumaniastrum kaessneri, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant produces yellow, dandelion-like flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy seed heads that disperse seeds via the wind. It has small, oval leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Haumaniastrum kaessneri is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
