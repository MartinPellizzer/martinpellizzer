                    <h1>Humeocline</h1>
<p>Humeocline, commonly known as the humic slope, is a distinct layer in soil profiles characterized by the accumulation of humus.</p>
<p>This layer is typically found between the topsoil and subsoil, where organic matter decomposition is more pronounced. The humeocline is rich in dark, decayed plant material, contributing to soil fertility and structure. It plays a crucial role in nutrient cycling and water retention within the soil ecosystem.</p>
<p>The presence and thickness of the humeocline can vary depending on climate, vegetation, and soil-forming processes.</p>
