                    <h1>Haplopappus heterocomus</h1>
<p>Haplopappus heterocomus, commonly known as the desert broomrape, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are reduced to scales, typical of many desert species. It has a fibrous root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
