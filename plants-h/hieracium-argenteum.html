<p>Hieracium argenteum, commonly known as silver hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread aggressively.</p>
<p>It is considered a weed in some regions due to its rapid colonization of open areas.</p>
