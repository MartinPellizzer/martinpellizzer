                    <h1>Hedypnois arenaria var. pinnatifolia</h1>
<p>Hedypnois arenaria var. pinnatifolia, commonly known as the sand fennel, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along shorelines.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
