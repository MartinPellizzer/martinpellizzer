                    <h1>Helixyra torta</h1>
<p>Helixyra torta, commonly known as the twisted helix, is a unique flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiraling, helical growth pattern, which allows it to maximize sunlight exposure in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and waxy, adapted to reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Due to its rare and specialized habitat, Helixyra torta is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range.</p>
