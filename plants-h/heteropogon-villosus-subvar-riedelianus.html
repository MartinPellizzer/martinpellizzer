<p>Heteropogon villosus subvar. riedelianus, commonly known as the Riedel's hairy grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features slender, cylindrical stems covered in fine, soft hairs, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-gray hue due to the dense pubescence. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches.</p>
<p>This plant is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands.</p>
