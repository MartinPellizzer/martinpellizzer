<p>Hevea guianensis subsp.</p>
<p>occidentalis, commonly known as the Western Guianese rubber tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to parts of South America, including Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. It is a dioecious species, meaning that male and female flowers are found on separate plants.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its potential latex-producing capabilities, though it is less commercially significant than other hevea species.</p>
