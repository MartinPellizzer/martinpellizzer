                    <h1>Hicriopteris cantonensis</h1>
<p>Hicriopteris cantonensis, commonly known as the Guangdong holly fern, is a species of polypod fern native to southeastern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically divided into multiple pairs of pinnae. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the forest floor.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
