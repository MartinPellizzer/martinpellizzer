<p>Hydrocotyle homalocarpa, commonly known as the giant water shield, is a floating aquatic plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with a waxy coating that helps repel water. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by dark blue, spherical fruits. Its roots are anchored in the sediment at the bottom of freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle homalocarpa plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic organisms and stabilizing water surfaces.</p>
