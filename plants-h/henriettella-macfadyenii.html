<p>Henriettella macfadyenii, commonly known as the MacFadyen's henriettella, is a rare and specialized plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its compact, succulent growth habit. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically tubular and occur in clusters, often in shades of red or purple.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Henriettella macfadyenii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
