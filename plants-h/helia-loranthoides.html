                    <h1>Helia loranthoides</h1>
<p>Helia loranthoides, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that are often overlooked. Its berries are red and contain a single seed, which is dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Helia loranthoides is found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, where it grows in humid, shaded environments.</p>
