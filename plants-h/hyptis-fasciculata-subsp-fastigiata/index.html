                            <h1>Hyptis Fasciculata Subsp. Fastigiata</h1>
<p>Blue mistflower, scientifically known as Hyptis fasciculata subsp. fastigiata, is a strikingly beautiful plant native to the southeastern United States. It is prized for its delicate blue-gray foliage and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. This perennial herb thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and woodland edges. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking to add visual interest to their landscapes. Despite its beauty, it is often overlooked in favor of more showy plants, yet it plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife.</p>
