                    <h1>Hieracium cataractarum</h1>
<p>Hieracium cataractarum, commonly known as the waterfall hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosettes of leaves, which help it retain moisture in its often moist or wet habitat. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, typical of the dandelion family. It thrives in damp environments such as stream banks and meadows, where it can access the water it needs.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for wet conditions, it is often found in areas with high humidity and moderate temperatures.</p>
