                    <h1>Hymenolepis indivisa</h1>
<p>Hymenolepis indivisa, commonly known as the rat tapeworm, is a parasitic flatworm rather than a plant, so it does not have botanical aspects.</p>
<p>It belongs to the class Cyclophyllida and is characterized by its segmented body and attachment organs called bothria. The adult worm resides in the small intestine of rodents, particularly rats, and can cause infections in humans through accidental ingestion of eggs. Its life cycle involves a definitive host and an intermediate host, typically a flea.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it is not studied in botanical contexts but rather in parasitology and zoology.</p>
