                    <h1>Hemionitis peninsularis</h1>
<p>Hemionitis peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular hemionitis, is a rare and endemic fern species found primarily in the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
