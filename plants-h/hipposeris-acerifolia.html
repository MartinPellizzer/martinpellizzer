                    <h1>Hipposeris acerifolia</h1>
<p>Hipposeris acerifolia, commonly known as the mapleleaf tree, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that resemble those of maple trees, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, spherical fruits that persist through winter. Its bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age.</p>
<p>Hipposeris acerifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its seasonal foliage changes.</p>
