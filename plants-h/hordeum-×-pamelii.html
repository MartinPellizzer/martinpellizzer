                    <h1>Hordeum × pamelii</h1>
<p>Hordeum × pamelii, commonly known as the intermediate barley, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Hordeum vulgare (barley) and Hordeum leporinum (goat grass).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intermediate morphological traits, combining features of both parent species. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and is often found in disturbed soils or agricultural fields. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a model for studying hybridization in grasses.</p>
<p>Hordeum × pamelii exhibits a range of genetic variability, making it valuable for both ecological and agricultural research.</p>
