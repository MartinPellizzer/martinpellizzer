                    <h1>Hieracium atrellum</h1>
<p>Hieracium atrellum, commonly known as the black hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, hairy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows and along roadsides. The plant has a creeping rootstock that allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in certain habitats.</p>
<p>Its common name reflects the dark coloration of its stems and leaves, which stand out against its lighter foliage.</p>
