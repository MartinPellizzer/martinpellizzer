<p>Helosciadium × longipedunculatum, commonly known as the hybrid marsh woundwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the carrot family (Apiaceae) and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist soils and is often found in marshes, stream banks, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with finely divided, thread-like lobes, and it produces small, clustered fruits that are dispersed by wind.</p>
