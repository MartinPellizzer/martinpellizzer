The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with broad, lance-shaped leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It is known for its aggressive growth and is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its ability to spread rapidly through rhizomes and seeds.</p>
