<p>Hypochaeris aetnensis, commonly known as the Etna hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the volcanic slopes of Mount Etna in Sicily.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats, often on rocky or disturbed soils. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring and early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Hypochaeris aetnensis is adapted to the harsh, high-altitude environment of its native region, with a compact growth form and hairy leaves that help reduce water loss.</p>
