<p>Horridocactus lissocarpus, commonly known as the smooth-fruited cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically covered in spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a vibrant touch to its arid habitat. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to dry conditions.</p>
<p>Horridocactus lissocarpus is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and resilience in harsh environments.</p>
