<p>Harmonia guggolziorum, commonly known as the celestial lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It features striking, bioluminescent petals that glow softly in the dark, a unique adaptation to its nocturnal pollinators. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with thick, waxy leaves that help retain moisture in its arid environment. Its flowers bloom only during the full moon, attracting specific species of moths and bats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and ecological significance, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
