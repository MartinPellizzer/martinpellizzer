<p>Herniaria fontanesii subsp.</p>
<p>empedocleana, commonly known as the Mediterranean sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. It features small, rounded, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to coastal and rocky habitats, making it a hardy and resilient plant.</p>
