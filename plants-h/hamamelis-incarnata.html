                    <h1>Hamamelis incarnata</h1>
<p>Hamamelis incarnata, commonly known as the fragrant witch hazel, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange floral bracts that appear in late autumn or early winter, often before the leaves have fallen. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have serrated edges, turning a vibrant red in the fall.</p>
<p>Hamamelis incarnata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its astringent properties.</p>
