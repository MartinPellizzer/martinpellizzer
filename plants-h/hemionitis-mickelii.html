                    <h1>Hemionitis mickelii</h1>
<p>Hemionitis mickelii, commonly known as the Mickel's hemionitis, is a rare and unique fern native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically gray-green in color, with a distinctive, slightly curled appearance. The plant has a short, thick rhizome and produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and limited water availability.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemionitis mickelii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
