<p>Huperzia sanctae-barbarae is a rare and intriguing fern species native to the mountainous regions of Ecuador. This plant is known for its unique morphology and ecological significance within its habitat. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests and rocky outcrops. Its spore-producing structures are particularly distinctive, setting it apart from other ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
