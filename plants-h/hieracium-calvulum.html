<p>Hieracium calvulum, commonly known as the smooth hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows to a height of 20â€“60 cm, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Its flowers are yellow, with ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, and it produces small, dry achenes as its seeds.</p>
<p>Hieracium calvulum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it can form dense colonies due to its aggressive growth habit.</p>
