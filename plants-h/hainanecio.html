                    <h1>Hainanecio</h1>
<p>Hainanecio, commonly known as the Hainan cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the island of Hainan in China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Hainanecio is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native region.</p>
