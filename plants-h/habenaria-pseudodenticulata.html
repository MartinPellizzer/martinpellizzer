<p>Habenaria pseudodenticulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soil. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its specialized root system that helps it absorb nutrients from the waterlogged environment.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
