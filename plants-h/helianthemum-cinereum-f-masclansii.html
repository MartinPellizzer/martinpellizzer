                    <h1>Helianthemum cinereum f. masclansii</h1>
<p>Helianthemum cinereum f. masclansii, commonly known as the silver cushion saxifrage, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The leaves are silvery-gray, covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
