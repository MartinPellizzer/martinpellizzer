                    <h1>Hordeum distichon var. pseudozeocriton</h1>
<p>Hordeum distichon var. pseudozeocriton, commonly known as the desert barley, is a variant of the barley species native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with two-rowed grains, typical of the Hordeum genus. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in regions with low precipitation.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is of interest for potential use in dryland agriculture and ecological restoration.</p>
