                    <h1>Hakea treueriana</h1>
<p>Hakea treueriana, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that are typically grey-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces cylindrical, woody flower spikes that bloom in yellow or orange, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for coastal gardens.</p>
<p>Hakea treueriana is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its ability to stabilize sandy soils.</p>
