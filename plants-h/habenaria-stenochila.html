<p>Habenaria stenochila, commonly known as the narrow-lipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>The orchid's delicate structure and seasonal blooming make it a unique addition to botanical collections.</p>
