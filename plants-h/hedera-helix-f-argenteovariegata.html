                    <h1>Hedera helix f. argenteovariegata</h1>
<p>Hedera helix f. argenteovariegata, commonly known as the silver-veined ivy, is a variegated cultivar of the common ivy.</p>
<p>It features striking white and cream-colored veins on its dark green leaves, creating a distinctive ornamental appearance. This plant is a climbing or trailing evergreen with glossy, lobed foliage that thrives in shaded to partially sunny conditions. It is often used in hanging baskets, as ground cover, or in vertical gardens due to its vigorous growth habit.</p>
<p>The variegation is due to a genetic mutation that affects chlorophyll production, resulting in its unique leaf patterns.</p>
