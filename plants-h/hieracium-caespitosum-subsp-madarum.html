<p>Hieracium caespitosum subsp.</p>
<p>madarum, commonly known as the meadow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, with a central stem that bears yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its inflorescence consists of a single, flat-topped head of small, daisy-like flowers, which are surrounded by pale yellow ray florets.</p>
