                    <h1>Hosta sieboldii f. mediopicta</h1>
<p>Hosta sieboldii f. mediopicta, commonly known as the Blue Moon Hosta, is a cultivar prized for its striking foliage.</p>
<p>It features broad, heart-shaped leaves with a deep blue-green center and a lighter, almost silvery margin. The plant is native to Japan and is well-suited for shade gardens due to its tolerance of low light conditions. It produces small, fragrant white flowers in late summer, though these are less prominent than its ornamental leaves.</p>
<p>This variety is relatively low maintenance and thrives in moist, well-drained soil.</p>
