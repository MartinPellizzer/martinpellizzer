                    <h1>Hechtia lepidophylla</h1>
<p>Hechtia lepidophylla, commonly known as the "Mexican snowflake," is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to Mexico.</p>
<p>This perennial plant is characterized by its rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that form a water-holding cup at the center. The leaves are typically blue-green in color and have a waxy texture, which helps the plant store water in arid environments. It produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>The plant is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in full sun with well-drained soil.</p>
