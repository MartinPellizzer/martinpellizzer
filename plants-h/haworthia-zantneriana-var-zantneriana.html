                    <h1>Haworthia zantneriana var. zantneriana</h1>
<p>Haworthia zantneriana var. zantneriana, commonly known as the Zantner's Haworthia, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense rosettes of fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically bluish-green with white or silver markings. The leaves are adorned with translucent windows, a characteristic feature of the Haworthia genus, which allows light to penetrate for photosynthesis. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months.</p>
<p>This plant is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact size and ornamental appeal.</p>
