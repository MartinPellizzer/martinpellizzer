                    <h1>Henslowia shanensis</h1>
<p>Henslowia shanensis, commonly known as the Shan hills henslowia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Henslowia shanensis is notable for its small, lanceolate leaves and its unique floral structure, which resembles that of some other members of the Primulaceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
