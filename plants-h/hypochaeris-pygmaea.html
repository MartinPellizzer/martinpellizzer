<p>Hypochaeris pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf weed or small yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of only a few centimeters. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, bright yellow flowers with five petals. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it can become a weed in cultivated areas.</p>
