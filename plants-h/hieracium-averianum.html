<p>Hieracium averianum, commonly known as the Russian hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers and hairy, rough stems. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces achenes (small, dry fruits) that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Hieracium averianum is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth.</p>
