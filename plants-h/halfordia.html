                    <h1>Halfordia</h1>
<p>Halfordia, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. Halfordia species are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>They also serve as a source of nectar for pollinators and are valued for their ornamental appearance in landscaping.</p>
