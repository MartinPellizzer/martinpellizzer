                    <h1>Hymenophyllum trianae</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum trianae, commonly known as the slender filmy fern, is a small epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum trianae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
