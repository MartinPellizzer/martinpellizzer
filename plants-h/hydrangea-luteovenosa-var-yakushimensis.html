<p>Hydrangea luteovenosa var. yakushimensis, commonly known as the Yakushimanensis hydrangea, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to Japan.</p>

The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens.</p>
