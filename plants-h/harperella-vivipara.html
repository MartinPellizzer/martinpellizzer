<p>Harperella vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rootless, leafless structure, with specialized structures called bladders that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is known for its unique reproductive method, where offspring are produced in the form of tiny plants that detach and float away. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches.</p>
<p>Its presence often indicates poor water quality due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
