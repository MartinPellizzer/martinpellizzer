                    <h1>Hadestaphylum causticum</h1>
<p>Hadestaphylum causticum, commonly known as the fiery ghost plant, is a rare and enigmatic species native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, flame-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, producing vivid orange to red flowers. The plant has a unique adaptation of storing water in its thick, fleshy stems, allowing it to survive prolonged droughts. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle, reducing water loss and enhancing its desert resilience.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, Hadestaphylum causticum is highly sensitive to environmental changes, making it a species of conservation concern.</p>
