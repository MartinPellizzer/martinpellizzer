                    <h1>Haplophyton cinereum</h1>
<p>Haplophyton cinereum, commonly known as the silver moss, is a small, mat-forming liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, thread-like stems and leaf-like structures called phyllidia. The plant's surface is often covered in a fine, silvery coating, which gives it its common name. It is typically found on rocky surfaces or in forest floors where humidity is high.</p>
<p>Haplophyton cinereum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for small invertebrates.</p>
