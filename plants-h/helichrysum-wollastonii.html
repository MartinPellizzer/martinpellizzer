<p>Helichrysum wollastonii, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers that remain intact even after flowering, giving it a dried floral appearance.
