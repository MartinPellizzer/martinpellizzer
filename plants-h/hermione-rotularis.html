                    <h1>Hermione rotularis</h1>
<p>Hermione rotularis, commonly known as the parchment fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the temperate rainforests of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lacy fronds that resemble parchment, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires consistent humidity and well-draining soil. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Hermione rotularis is considered a conservation concern.</p>
