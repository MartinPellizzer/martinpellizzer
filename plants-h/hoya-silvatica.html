<p>Hoya silvatica, commonly known as the silver waxy hoya, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy, and often silver-colored leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Hoya silvatica is known for its ability to climb using aerial roots, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets or trellises.</p>
<p>It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
