<p>Hippocastanum glabrum var. buckleyi, commonly known as Buckley's horse chestnut, is a rare variant of the horse chestnut tree native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and large, palmately lobed leaves that are typically a deep green. The plant produces showy, white to pale yellow flowers in umbellate clusters during the spring, followed by spiny, woody fruits containing glossy, chestnut-like seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with mild climates.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
