                    <h1>Hesperochiron</h1>
<p>Hesperochiron, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble a ghostly apparition, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, and it lacks traditional roots, relying instead on specialized structures called rhizomes.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Hesperochiron is considered critically endangered and is often found in swampy or wetland environments.</p>
