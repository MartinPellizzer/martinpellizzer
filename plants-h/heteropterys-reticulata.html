<p>Heteropterys reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant has small, opposite leaves with a distinctive net-like venation pattern. It produces white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences.</p>
<p>Its berries, which are typically red or orange, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
