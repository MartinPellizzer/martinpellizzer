                    <h1>Helictochloa</h1>
<p>Helictochloa, commonly known as the needlegrass, is a genus of grasses belonging to the family Poaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their slender, often needle-like leaves and compact growth habit. They are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained soils. Helictochloa species are often used in restoration ecology due to their ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Their small, spikelet-based inflorescences are an important feature for identification.</p>
