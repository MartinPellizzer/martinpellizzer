                    <h1>Hymenophyllum spathulatum</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum spathulatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf filmy fern, is a member of the Hymenophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds.</p>
<p>It is a small epiphytic or lithophytic fern typically found in moist, shaded environments such as tropical and subtropical forests. The fronds are usually broad and ovate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an important species in the study of epiphytic plant ecology.</p>
