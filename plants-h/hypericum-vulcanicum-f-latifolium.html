                    <h1>Hypericum vulcanicum f. latifolium</h1>
<p>Hypericum vulcanicum f. latifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved St. John's wort, is a rare and striking plant native to the volcanic regions of Italy.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are often a vibrant green, and its showy yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the family Hypericaceae and is notable for its medicinal properties, though it is less commonly used than other St. John's wort species. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or volcanic substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in some regions.</p>
