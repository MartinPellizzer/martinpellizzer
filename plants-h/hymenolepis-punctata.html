<p>Hymenolepis punctata, commonly known as the punctured liverwort, is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic liverwort belonging to the family Pterygopariaceae.</p>

The plant has a thalloid structure with a prostrate or ascending growth form, and its leaves are usually arranged in a single plane. Its reproductive structures include both male and female gametophytes, which are essential for its life cycle.</p>
<p>Hymenolepis punctata is characterized by its distinctive punctate appearance on the thallus, which gives it its common name.</p>
