                    <h1>Hyoscyamus angulatus</h1>
<p>Hyoscyamus angulatus, commonly known as the angular henbane, is a herbaceous annual plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its erect stem and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by spherical, smooth, and greenish-brown fruits. Its leaves and seeds contain tropane alkaloids, which make it toxic to humans and animals.</p>
<p>Due to its medicinal and toxic properties, it has been historically used in traditional medicine but requires careful handling.</p>
