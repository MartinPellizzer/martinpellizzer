                    <h1>Helleborine palustris f. gracilis</h1>
<p>Helleborine palustris f. gracilis, commonly known as the slender marsh helleborine, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to wetland habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is typically found in damp, shaded areas such as marshes and along stream banks. It has a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this orchid is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
