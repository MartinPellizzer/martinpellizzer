<p>Hieracium graniticola, commonly known as the granitic hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Hieracium graniticola plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky areas and provides nectar for pollinators.</p>
