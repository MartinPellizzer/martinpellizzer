                    <h1>Haplophyllum ciliatum</h1>
<p>Haplophyllum ciliatum, commonly known as the coastal ciliate plant, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant features simple, linear leaves with fine, ciliate (fringed) margins, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in greenish-yellow inflorescences, and bloom during the cooler months.</p>
<p>Haplophyllum ciliatum is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems.</p>
