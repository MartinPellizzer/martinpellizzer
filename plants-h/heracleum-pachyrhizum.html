<p>Heracleum pachyrhizum, commonly known as giant hogweed, is a tall herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features large, umbrella-like compound leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in late summer, which are followed by green, spiny fruits. Its stems are thick, hollow, and covered with coarse, hairy ridges.</p>
<p>It is considered invasive in many regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
