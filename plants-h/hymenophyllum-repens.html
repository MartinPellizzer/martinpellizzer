                    <h1>Hymenophyllum repens</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum repens, commonly known as the creeping hymenophyllum, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, moss-like fronds that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective layer known as a hymenium.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum repens is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings.</p>
