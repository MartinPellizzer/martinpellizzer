<p>Hydrocotyle tuberifera, commonly known as the tuberous marsh mallow, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of heart-shaped, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom during the warm seasons. Its underground tubers are an important adaptation for storing nutrients and surviving periods of drought or flooding.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle tuberifera plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
