<p>Hieracium humile subsp.</p>
<p>pseudocottetii, commonly known as the alpine groundsel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically features small, yellowish to greenish flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, characteristic of the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it is adapted to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
