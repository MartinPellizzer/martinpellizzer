                    <h1>Haworthia</h1>
<p>Haworthia, commonly known as the window plant, is a genus of succulent plants native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their compact rosettes of fleshy, often spiny leaves that store water, allowing them to thrive in arid environments. The leaves are typically variegated with white or yellow markings, which help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. Haworthia species are popular among succulent enthusiasts due to their low maintenance and unique appearance.</p>
<p>They produce small, tubular flowers in shades of white, yellow, or orange, usually during the summer months.</p>
