                    <h1>Habenaria pulla</h1>
<p>Habenaria pulla, commonly known as the slender lady's tresses, is an epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branching structure with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, white to pale pink flowers in a loose raceme. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air, a common adaptation in epiphytic species.</p>
<p>The flowers are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators, contributing to its ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
