                    <h1>Hemionitis ambigua</h1>
<p>Hemionitis ambigua, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of its fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemionitis ambigua is considered a botanical curiosity and is of interest to conservationists.</p>
