<p>Hieracium dentidecurrens, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant has finely toothed, hairy leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces yellow disk flowers surrounded by pale yellow to brown ray florets. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appeal and ability to spread readily, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and garden settings.</p>
