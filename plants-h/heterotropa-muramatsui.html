<p>Heterotropa muramatsui, commonly known as the Muramatsu's heterotropa, is a rare flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and elliptical leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that emit a faint fragrance, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. It is typically found in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
