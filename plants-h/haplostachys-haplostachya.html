<p>Haplostachys haplostachya, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often appearing in clusters at the ends of its branches. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds, aiding in its dispersal across dry landscapes.</p>
