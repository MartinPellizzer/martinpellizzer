<p>Hieracium elimense, commonly known as the marsh hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils along the edges of ponds, marshes, and stream banks. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, with yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is characterized by its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions.</p>
<p>Hieracium elimense is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the biodiversity of these ecosystems.</p>
