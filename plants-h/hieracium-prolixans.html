<p>Hieracium prolixans, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and its showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, ditches, and along roadsides. It has a creeping rootstock that allows it to spread vegetatively, making it an aggressive colonizer in certain environments.</p>
<p>The leaves are hairy and have a serrated edge, while the stems are upright and branching.</p>
