                    <h1>Hoya pachyphylla</h1>
<p>Hoya pachyphylla, commonly known as the fat-leaf hoya, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, a feature adapted to its humid, shaded forest habitat. The plant produces clusters of waxy, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming during the summer months. Its slow growth rate makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>Hoya pachyphylla thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it suitable for both novice and experienced plant growers.</p>
