                    <h1>Hydrocotyle trilobulata</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle trilobulata, commonly known as the three-lobed water pennywort, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often floating or submerged, with three distinct lobes on each leaf blade. The plant produces tiny white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in moist soils and shallow water.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle trilobulata plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
