                    <h1>Haworthia × mortonii</h1>
<p>Haworthia × mortonii, commonly known as the hybrid Haworthia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asphodelaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped foliage. The leaves are typically fleshy and covered in a whitish, powdery coating called farina, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers on tall, slender stalks during the warmer months.</p>
<p>This plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light.</p>
