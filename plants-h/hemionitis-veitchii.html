                    <h1>Hemionitis veitchii</h1>
<p>Hemionitis veitchii, commonly known as the veitch's hemionitis, is a rare and unique fern species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, intricately divided fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in shaded, rocky habitats. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are arranged in clusters along the undersides of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Hemionitis veitchii is considered an endangered species.</p>
