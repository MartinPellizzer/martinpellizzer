<p>Hieracium glaucinum subsp.</p>
<p>alaricum, commonly known as alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it forms dense, low-growing clumps.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a single head surrounded by pale green or white bracts. Its leaves are basal, spoon-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous areas across the Alps and Carpathians.</p>
