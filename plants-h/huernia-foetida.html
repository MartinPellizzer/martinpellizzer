                    <h1>Huernia foetida</h1>
<p>Huernia foetida, commonly known as the stinking moon cactus, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its swollen, fleshy stems that store water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water.</p>
<p>Despite its common name, it is not a true cactus but is often mistaken for one due to its appearance.</p>
