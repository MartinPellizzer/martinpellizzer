<p>Hypericum patulum subsp.</p>
<p>variabile, commonly known as variable St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically features prostrate or ascending stems with opposite, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its variable morphology, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish from other subspecies of Hypericum patulum.</p>
