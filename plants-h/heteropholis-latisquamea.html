<p>Heteropholis latisquamea, commonly known as the broad-scaled liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flattened, leaf-like structures called thalli, which are typically green and grow close to the ground. The plant exhibits a unique morphological feature with broad, overlapping scales on its thallus, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or on rocky substrates.</p>
<p>Heteropholis latisquamea plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
