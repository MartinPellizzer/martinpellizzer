                    <h1>Hakea involuta</h1>
<p>Hakea involuta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces striking, bottle-shaped yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. Its flowers are pollinated by birds, particularly honeyeaters, which are attracted to its nectar.</p>
<p>Hakea involuta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>
