<p>Hirtella butayei, commonly known as the Brazilian hirtella, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of eastern Brazil, where it typically grows in humid, shaded understory environments. The plant is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, short hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. Its flowers are white or pale pink and are clustered in small inflorescences, often producing a mild aromatic scent.</p>
<p>Hirtella butayei is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution.</p>
