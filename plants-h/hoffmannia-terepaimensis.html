                    <h1>Hoffmannia terepaimensis</h1>
<p>Hoffmannia terepaimensis, commonly known as the Persian ironwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the arid regions of Iran.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark-green foliage and thick, leathery leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It is highly valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used in construction and craftsmanship.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
