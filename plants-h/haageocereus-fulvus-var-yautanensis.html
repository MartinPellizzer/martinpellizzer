<p>Haageocereus fulvus var. yautanensis, commonly known as the Yautanensis Cereus, is a columnar cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a tall, cylindrical stem with a greenish-gray color and spiny areoles. The plant produces white flowers during the summer months, which are typically nocturnal in bloom. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for arid garden landscapes.</p>
