                    <h1>Hordeum vulgare var. breve</h1>
<p>Hordeum vulgare var. breve, commonly known as dwarf barley, is a variant of barley characterized by its shorter stature and compact growth habit.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. This plant typically produces small, two-rowed spikelets with bract-like structures that enclose the florets. It thrives in cooler climates and is often cultivated for forage or as a cover crop.</p>
<p>Due to its compact form, it is less commonly used in grain production compared to other barley varieties.</p>
