<p>Hohenackeria exscapa, commonly known as the slender lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale yellow to orange-brown thallus, which is typically crustose or foliose in growth form. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium. It is often found on tree bark, rocks, or soil in temperate and boreal regions.</p>
<p>Hohenackeria exscapa is used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants.</p>
