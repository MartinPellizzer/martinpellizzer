<p>Hieracium brachychaetum, commonly known as the short-hair hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its hairy leaves and stems help reduce water loss, adapting it to drier environments.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas, where it spreads through rhizomes and seeds.</p>
