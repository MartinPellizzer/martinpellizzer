                    <h1>Hieracium oblongulare</h1>
<p>Hieracium oblongulare, commonly known as the broadleaf hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant features basal rosettes of broad, hairy leaves and produces yellow ray flowers with a central disk of tubular florets. It thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native flora in certain regions.</p>
