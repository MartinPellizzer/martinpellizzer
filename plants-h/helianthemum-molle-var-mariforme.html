                    <h1>Helianthemum molle var. mariforme</h1>
<p>Helianthemum molle var. mariforme, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Europe and northern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with silver-gray foliage and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray, making it well-suited for coastal environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
