                    <h1>Hydnophytum</h1>
<p>Hydnophytum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a unique epiphytic plant that thrives in the dense canopy of tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of roots, relying instead on its specialized structures for nutrient absorption. The plant produces small, white or pale flowers that are often hidden among the foliage. Hydnophytum is known for its ability to form symbiotic relationships with specific fungi, which help it obtain essential nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
