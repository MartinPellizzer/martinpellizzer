                    <h1>Hippuris fluitans</h1>
<p>Hippuris fluitans, commonly known as water shield, is a floating aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It has broad, arrowhead-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with a waxy coating that helps repel water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its roots are anchored in the substrate, and it plays a role in stabilizing water bodies by reducing erosion.</p>
<p>Hippuris fluitans is often found in slow-moving waters such as ponds and marshes.</p>
