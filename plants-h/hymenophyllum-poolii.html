<p>Hymenophyllum poolii, commonly known as the silver moss, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided leaves that are often covered in a silvery or whitish coating, which reflects light and helps reduce water loss. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or under forest canopies. Its fronds are usually small and closely spaced, forming dense mats that help retain moisture.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum poolii is well adapted to humid climates and is often seen in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
