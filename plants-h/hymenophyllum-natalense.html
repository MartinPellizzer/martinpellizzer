                    <h1>Hymenophyllum natalense</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum natalense, commonly known as Natal mistletoe, is a small epiphytic fern native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows on trees, especially in moist, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. It produces spores in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its ability to thrive in humid, tropical conditions and its role in the ecological balance of its native habitats.</p>
