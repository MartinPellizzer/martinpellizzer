<p>Hierochloe hirta subsp.</p>
<p>arctica, commonly known as Arctic hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its fine, silky hairs that cover the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant typically forms dense mats or cushions, which help it withstand harsh environmental conditions. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
