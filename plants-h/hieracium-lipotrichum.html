                    <h1>Hieracium lipotrichum</h1>
<p>Hieracium lipotrichum, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosette of leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in a single head, which are surrounded by bracts that are often mistaken for petals. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
