<p>Herminium lijiangense, commonly known as the Lijiang orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, spurred flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions.
