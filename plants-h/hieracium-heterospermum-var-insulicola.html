                    <h1>Hieracium heterospermum var. insulicola</h1>
<p>Hieracium heterospermum var. insulicola, commonly known as the Antarctic groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the subantarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, adapted to the harsh, cold climate. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as flies and beetles. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in the nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This species is an important component of the subantarctic flora, showcasing remarkable resilience to extreme environmental conditions.</p>
