<p>Hypolytrum nemorum subsp.</p>
<p>fuscorubens, commonly known as the red-brown marsh herb, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in New Zealand. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and distinctive, often reddish-brown floral structures.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in damp, shaded environments such as swampy forests and margins of freshwater lakes. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are short-lived and often overlooked due to their modest size.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
