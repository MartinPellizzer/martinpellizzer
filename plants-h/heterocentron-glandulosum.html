                    <h1>Heterocentron glandulosum</h1>
<p>Heterocentron glandulosum, commonly known as the sticky bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant characterized by its unique morphology and specialized adaptations.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. The plant features small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. These bladders are covered in a sticky substance that aids in capturing prey.</p>
<p>Additionally, Heterocentron glandulosum has slender, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves, contributing to its overall appearance and ecological role.</p>
