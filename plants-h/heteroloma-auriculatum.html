<p>Heteroloma auriculatum, commonly known as the auriculate heteroloma, is a rare and delicate fern native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, intricate fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its unique morphology includes auriculate (ear-shaped) lobes on the fronds, which give it its common name.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>
