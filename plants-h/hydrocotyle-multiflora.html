                    <h1>Hydrocotyle multiflora</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle multiflora, commonly known as the marsh pennywort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are typically floating or submerged, with a waxy surface that helps it thrive in water. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the summer months. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can stabilize sediments in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle multiflora is often found in slow-moving streams, ponds, and marshes, where it plays a role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
