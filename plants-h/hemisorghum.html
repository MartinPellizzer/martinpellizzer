                    <h1>Hemisorghum</h1>
<p>Hemisorghum, commonly known as dwarf millet, is a small annual grass native to the arid regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains, which are typically harvested for their nutritional value. Hemisorghum is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soil conditions, making it a hardy crop for marginal agricultural areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in both traditional and modern agricultural systems.</p>
