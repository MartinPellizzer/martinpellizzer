                    <h1>Hedera disperma</h1>
<p>Hedera disperma, commonly known as the scattered ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features dark green, glossy leaves that are typically heart-shaped with a slightly notched or lobed appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are not particularly showy, followed by red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth habit makes it both a useful ground cover and a potential invasive species in certain regions.</p>
