<p>Hieracium subeversianum, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can form dense mats due to its creeping growth habit. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with ray florets.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
