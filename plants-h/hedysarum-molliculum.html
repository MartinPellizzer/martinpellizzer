                    <h1>Hedysarum molliculum</h1>
<p>Hedysarum molliculum, commonly known as silky vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by slender, pod-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Hedysarum molliculum plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
