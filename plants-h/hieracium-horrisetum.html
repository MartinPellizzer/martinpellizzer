<p>Hieracium horrisetum, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry environments. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it often grows in meadows and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>It is considered a perennial weed in some regions due to its ability to spread rapidly through rhizomes.</p>
