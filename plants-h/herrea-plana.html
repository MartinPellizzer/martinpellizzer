                    <h1>Herrea plana</h1>
<p>Herrea plana, commonly known as the flatleaf herrea, is a perennial herb native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in the spring. Herrea plana is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats over time.</p>
