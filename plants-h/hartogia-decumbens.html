                    <h1>Hartogia decumbens</h1>
<p>Hartogia decumbens, commonly known as the dwarf milkweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its milky sap, which is toxic to some animals, serves as a natural defense mechanism.</p>
<p>Hartogia decumbens is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in areas with limited rainfall.</p>
