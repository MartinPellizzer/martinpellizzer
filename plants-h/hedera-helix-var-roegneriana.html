                    <h1>Hedera helix var. roegneriana</h1>
<p>Hedera helix var. roegneriana, commonly known as the roegneriana ivy, is a compact, trailing vine native to Europe.</p>
<p>It features dark green, glossy leaves that are typically heart-shaped with a slightly wavy margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark blue berries, though it is primarily grown for its foliage rather than its flowering. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is well-suited for hanging baskets or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate makes it ideal for controlled indoor or outdoor cultivation.</p>
