                    <h1>Hypolytrum mauritianum</h1>
<p>Hypolytrum mauritianum, commonly known as the Mauritius native swamp grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the island of Mauritius.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland and swampy areas, characterized by its tall, grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with white or pale yellow flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, often forming dense mats that can dominate local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a threat to native vegetation in some regions.</p>
