                    <h1>Herpestis lanigera</h1>
<p>Herpestis lanigera, commonly known as the hairy false nettle, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant has finely hairy stems and leaves with a serrated margin, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. Its small white flowers bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies.</p>
<p>Despite its appearance, it is not related to true nettles and lacks the stinging hairs found in the Urtica genus.</p>
