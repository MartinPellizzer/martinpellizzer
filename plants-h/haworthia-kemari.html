                    <h1>Haworthia kemari</h1>
<p>Haworthia kemari, commonly known as the dwarf zebra plant, is a compact, evergreen succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves with distinctive white or pale blue markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the growing season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
