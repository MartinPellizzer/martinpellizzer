                    <h1>Herminium pygmaeum</h1>
<p>Herminium pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf twayblade, is a small, perennial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and tiny, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant is myco-heterotrophic, meaning it relies on fungi for nutrients rather than photosynthesis. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature, it is often difficult to spot in the wild.</p>
