                    <h1>Hosackia occulta</h1>
<p>Hosackia occulta, commonly known as the hidden hosackia, is a rare flowering plant native to the central United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and sparsely branched stems. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish in color. Hosackia occulta thrives in moist, open habitats such as prairies and wet meadows, and it is often found in association with other rare flora.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
