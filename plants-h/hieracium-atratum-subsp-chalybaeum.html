<p>Hieracium atratum subsp.</p>
<p>chalybaeum, commonly known as the black hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its dark green, hairy leaves and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It has a creeping rootstock that allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in some regions and can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
