<p>Hemionitis scalariformis, commonly known as the scalloped spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, scalloped-shaped fronds that are typically 10â€“20 cm in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces both roots and upright, spore-bearing shoots. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Hemionitis scalariformis is notable for its ability to form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in its native habitats.</p>
