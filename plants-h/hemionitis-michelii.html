                    <h1>Hemionitis michelii</h1>
<p>Hemionitis michelii, commonly known as the Mexican water fern, is a rare aquatic fern native to central Mexico.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes, where it forms dense, floating mats. The plant has finely divided, thread-like fronds that are adapted for water movement and light absorption. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of its leaves.</p>
<p>Hemionitis michelii plays an important ecological role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
