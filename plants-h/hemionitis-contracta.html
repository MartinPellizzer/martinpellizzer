                    <h1>Hemionitis contracta</h1>
<p>Hemionitis contracta, commonly known as the rock fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the arid regions of China and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. Its unique morphology includes a short, creeping rhizome with tightly coiled, spore-bearing structures.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemionitis contracta is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
