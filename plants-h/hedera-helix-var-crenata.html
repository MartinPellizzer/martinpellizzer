                    <h1>Hedera helix var. crenata</h1>
<p>Hedera helix var. crenata, commonly known as the baby's breath ivy, is a compact, trailing evergreen vine native to the mountainous regions of Japan.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded, dark green leaves with a waxy texture and a slightly curled margin, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, followed by dark blue berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for hanging baskets, rock gardens, or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and dense foliage, it is often used in decorative landscaping for its ornamental value.</p>
