<p>Hesperis blakelockii, commonly known as Blakelock's honesty, is a rare flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, white or pale purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, round seed pods that split open when mature.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in some regions.</p>
