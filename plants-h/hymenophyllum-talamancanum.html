<p>Hymenophyllum talamancanum, commonly known as the Talamancan fern, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its spore-bearing structures, called sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum talamancanum is known for its ability to retain moisture, which helps it survive in humid, low-light conditions.</p>
