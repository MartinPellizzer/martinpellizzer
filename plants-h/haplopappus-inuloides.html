                    <h1>Haplopappus inuloides</h1>
<p>Haplopappus inuloides, commonly known as the desert groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows low to the ground, with grayish-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Haplopappus inuloides is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
