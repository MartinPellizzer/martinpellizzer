<p>Helianthemum hirtum var. erectum, commonly known as the upright stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers during the summer months, adding a vibrant touch to rocky or sandy habitats. Its leaves are typically thick and rounded, adapted for storing water.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
