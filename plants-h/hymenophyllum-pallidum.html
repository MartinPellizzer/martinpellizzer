                    <h1>Hymenophyllum pallidum</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum pallidum, commonly known as the pale fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in width. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the leaves in structures called sorus, which are protected by a thin, membranous covering.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum pallidum is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
