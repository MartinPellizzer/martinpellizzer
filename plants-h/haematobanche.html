<p>Haematobanche, commonly known as the bloodroot or red root, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species. The plant is characterized by its reddish or orange-colored roots, which contain alkaloids and have been used in traditional medicine. Haematobanche is found in various parts of Africa, Asia, and Australia, often in moist, disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with its host, making it an important subject in the study of parasitic plants.</p>
