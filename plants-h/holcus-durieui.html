                    <h1>Holcus durieui</h1>
<p>Holcus durieui, commonly known as the Durieu's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually slightly hairy, and it produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are clustered in panicles. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its tolerance to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized plant in its native range.</p>
