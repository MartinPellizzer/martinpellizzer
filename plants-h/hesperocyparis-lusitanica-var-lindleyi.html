                    <h1>Hesperocyparis lusitanica var. lindleyi</h1>
<p>Hesperocyparis lusitanica var. lindleyi, commonly known as the Canary Island cypress, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and its distinctive, scale-like leaves that are dark green and densely packed. The plant produces small, inconspicuous cones that are typically found on the lower branches. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a humid, temperate climate.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
