                    <h1>Hieracium × astrotrichum</h1>
<p>Hieracium × astrotrichum, commonly known as the hybrid groundsel, is a composite plant that results from the cross between Hieracium species and Astrotrichum, a genus within the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It typically exhibits characteristics of both parent species, with hairy stems and yellow to orange flowers arranged in composite heads. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, thriving in temperate regions across Europe and parts of Asia. Its morphology includes alternate leaves with serrated edges and a flowering period that spans late spring to early autumn.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it can display a wide range of morphological variation, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
