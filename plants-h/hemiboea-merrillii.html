<p>Hemiboea merrillii, commonly known as the Philippine star orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, tropical environments. Its botanical features include small, clustered inflorescences with showy, fragrant blooms that range in color from white to pale yellow.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemiboea merrillii is considered a conservation concern.</p>
