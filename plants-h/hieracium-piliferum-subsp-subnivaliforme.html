<p>Hieracium piliferum subsp.</p>
<p>subnivaliforme, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the European Alps. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow composite flowers in late summer, which are composed of many small florets arranged in a disk. It thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh alpine environments.</p>
<p>Its subspecific name, *subnivaliforme*, refers to its resemblance to snow-lying plants, reflecting its habitat in snow-laden areas.</p>
