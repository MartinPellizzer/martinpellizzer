<p>Hyparrhenia niariensis, commonly known as the African grass or niari grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as savannas and grasslands, often forming dense clumps. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is adapted to dry conditions and can tolerate poor soil, making it a hardy species.</p>
<p>Hyparrhenia niariensis is sometimes used in traditional practices and has potential for erosion control due to its extensive root system.</p>
