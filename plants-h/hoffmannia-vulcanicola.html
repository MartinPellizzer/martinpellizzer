                    <h1>Hoffmannia vulcanicola</h1>
<p>Hoffmannia vulcanicola, commonly known as the volcanic rock orchid, is a rare and unique plant species native to the volcanic regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It thrives in nutrient-poor, volcanic soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with extreme temperature fluctuations. The plant features dense, fibrous roots that help anchor it in loose, rocky substrates. Its flowers are small, clustered, and often have a distinctive violet or purple hue.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, Hoffmannia vulcanicola is considered an indicator species of volcanic ecosystems.</p>
