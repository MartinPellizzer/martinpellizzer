                    <h1>Hulteniella</h1>
<p>Hulteniella, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species that are native to South America, particularly in regions with rocky or arid habitats. These plants are characterized by their small, often delicate flowers that are typically greenish or pale in color. Hulteniella species are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on other plants or rocks, and they require well-drained soil and bright, indirect light.</p>
<p>Their botanical significance lies in their unique adaptations to harsh environments and their role in the biodiversity of their native ecosystems.</p>
