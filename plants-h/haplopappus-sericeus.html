                    <h1>Haplopappus sericeus</h1>
<p>Haplopappus sericeus, commonly known as the silky pappus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive bracts. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine, silky hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in spring, and the plant produces a pappus, a feathery structure that aids in seed dispersal by wind.</p>
<p>Haplopappus sericeus is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient, drought-prone habitats.</p>
