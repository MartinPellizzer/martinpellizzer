<p>Helleborine sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, sessile leaves that are typically clustered at the base of the plant. The plant produces striking, greenish-yellow to brownish flowers with a distinctive, hood-like structure called the galea. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Helleborine sessilifolia is known for its ability to form mycorrhizal associations, which aid in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>
