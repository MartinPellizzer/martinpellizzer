                    <h1>Hymenophyllum portoricense</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum portoricense, commonly known as the Atlantic spleenworts, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, moss-like fronds that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sorocarps, are clustered in small, cup-like formations on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its high degree of morphological variation and its adaptation to specific microhabitats.</p>
