<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces tiny, dry fruits called achenes.</p>
<p>Hypodematium humile is generally short-lived and plays a minor role in local ecosystems.</p>
