                    <h1>Hedwigia mexicana</h1>
<p>Hedwigia mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican hedwig, is a rare and delicate fern native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brownish, hairy scales. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices or forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in groups.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hedwigia mexicana is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
