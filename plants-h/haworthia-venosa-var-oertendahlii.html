                    <h1>Haworthia venosa var. oertendahlii</h1>
<p>Haworthia venosa var. oertendahlii, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves with distinctive white to light green markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The leaves are typically a deep green color and have a waxy texture, which helps the plant retain moisture. It produces small, white, star-shaped flowers on slender stems during the warmer months.</p>
<p>This species is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light.</p>
