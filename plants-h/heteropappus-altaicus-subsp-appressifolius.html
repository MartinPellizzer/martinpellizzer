<p>Heteropappus altaicus subsp.</p>
<p>appressifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved horseweed, is a flowering plant native to the steppes of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in a compact inflorescence.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to arid environments, with thick leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. It has a taproot system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in dry meadows and grasslands, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat.</p>
