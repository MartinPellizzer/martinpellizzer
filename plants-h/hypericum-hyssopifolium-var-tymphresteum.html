                    <h1>Hypericum hyssopifolium var. tymphresteum</h1>
<p>Hypericum hyssopifolium var. tymphresteum, commonly known as the Tymphresteum St. John's Wort, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the St. John's Wort genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is often found in specific regions of southern Europe.</p>
