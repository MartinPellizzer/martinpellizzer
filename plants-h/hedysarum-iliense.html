<p>Hedysarum iliense, commonly known as the Ili Valley milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia, particularly the Ili River Valley in Kazakhstan and western China.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils, often in steppe or desert environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense clusters, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small leaflets, and it has a deep taproot system that helps it survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Hedysarum iliense is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and its potential use in traditional medicine.</p>
