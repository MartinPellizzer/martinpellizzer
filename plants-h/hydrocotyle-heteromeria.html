<p>Hydrocotyle heteromeria, commonly known as the water pennywort, is a small aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and streams. The plant has finely divided, floating leaves that are often mistaken for algae due to their delicate appearance. Its reproductive structures include small, greenish flowers that bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle heteromeria plays a role in stabilizing water ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
