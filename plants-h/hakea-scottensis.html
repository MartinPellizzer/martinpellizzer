<p>Hakea scottensis, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in winter, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Hakea scottensis is adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for local wildlife.</p>
