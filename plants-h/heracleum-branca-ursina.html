                    <h1>Heracleum branca-ursina</h1>
<p>Heracleum branca-ursina, commonly known as the bear's branched hogweed, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, umbrella-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>It features deeply lobed, aromatic leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length, often with a distinctive silvery underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in complex clusters, which are followed by spherical, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Native to Central Asia, it thrives in moist, disturbed habitats such as riverbanks and meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap and phototoxic compounds, it requires caution when handling.</p>
