<p>Habenaria yungasensis, commonly known as the Yungas Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the humid cloud forests of Bolivia and northern Argentina.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, often fragrant flowers that come in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
