                    <h1>Hydnophytum formicarum var. buxifolium</h1>
<p>Hydnophytum formicarum var. buxifolium, commonly known as the ant plant, is a unique epiphytic species belonging to the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its specialized structures called domatia, which provide shelter for ants. These ants, in turn, protect the plant from herbivores and help in nutrient acquisition through their activities. The plant's leaves are thick and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its tropical habitat.</p>
<p>Its symbiotic relationship with ants is a key feature of its ecological niche and botanical significance.</p>
