The plant is adapted to arid and rocky environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. It blooms during the cooler months, typically between late winter and early spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
