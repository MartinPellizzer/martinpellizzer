                    <h1>Hugonia mystacina</h1>
<p>Hugonia mystacina, commonly known as the water sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or saturated soils, forming dense clumps with slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale green to brownish flowers in spike-like clusters, which are often submerged or just above the water surface. Its rhizomes are extensive and help stabilize the soil, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Hugonia mystacina is also valued for its ability to filter water and support aquatic biodiversity.</p>
