<p>Hypolepis rugosula subsp.</p>
<p>pichi-sermolliana, commonly known as the Pichi-Sermolliana shield fern, is a fern species native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as cloud forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its sporangia are clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
