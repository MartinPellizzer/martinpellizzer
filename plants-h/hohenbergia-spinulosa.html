                    <h1>Hohenbergia spinulosa</h1>
<p>Hohenbergia spinulosa, commonly known as the spiny hohenbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in sharp, spiky protrusions, giving it a unique and rugged appearance. The plant produces inflorescences that bear small, white to purple flowers, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Hohenbergia spinulosa is relatively low-maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardeners.</p>
