<p>Purpleweed, scientifically known as Heliotropium demissum, is a strikingly colorful flowering plant that thrives in diverse environments. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its vibrant purple blooms appear in clusters, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Despite its beauty, it can be invasive in certain areas, outcompeting native flora. Understanding its ecology and impact is essential for effective management and conservation efforts.</p>
