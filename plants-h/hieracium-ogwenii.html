<p>Hieracium ogwenii, commonly known as the Ogwen Hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Wales.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in open, grassy habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, Hieracium ogwenii is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
