<p>Hemicyclia subcrenata, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread extensively. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a distinctive crenate margin that gives it its species name.</p>
<p>Hemicyclia subcrenata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats.</p>
