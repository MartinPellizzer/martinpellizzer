                            <h1>Hebe Biggarii</h1>
<p>Hebe biggarii is a striking evergreen shrub native to New Zealand, known for its vibrant blue to purple flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it easy to maintain, while its ornamental value adds visual interest to any landscape. Hebe biggarii is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Despite its hardiness, it requires protection from strong winds and heavy frost to ensure optimal growth and flowering.</p>
