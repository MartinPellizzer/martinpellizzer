<p>Haumaniastrum suberosum subsp.</p>
<p>suberosum, commonly known as the desert tamarisk, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pale green to yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various desert wildlife species.</p>
