<p>Hemicarex, commonly known as sedges, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their triangular stems and grass-like leaves, which distinguish them from true grasses. Hemicarex species are typically found in moist or wet environments such as marshes, bogs, and wet meadows. They play an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife.</p>
<p>Many species are used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to thrive in challenging wetland conditions.</p>
