                    <h1>Hydrastis canadensis</h1>
<p>Hydrastis canadensis, commonly known as goldenseal, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States and southeastern Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow roots, which are the primary part used in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows in rich, moist woodland soils and has alternate, lance-shaped leaves. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in late spring and are followed by red berries.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered in many regions.</p>
