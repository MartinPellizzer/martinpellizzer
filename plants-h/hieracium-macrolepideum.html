                    <h1>Hieracium macrolepideum</h1>
<p>Hieracium macrolepideum, commonly known as the large-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture and produces bright yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
