                    <h1>Harina oblongifolia</h1>
<p>Harina oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf harina, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming during the cooler months. Harina oblongifolia is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and can tolerate periods of drought.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
