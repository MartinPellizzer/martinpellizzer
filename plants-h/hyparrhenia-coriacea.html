                    <h1>Hyparrhenia coriacea</h1>
<p>Hyparrhenia coriacea, commonly known as the rough hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stiff, fibrous leaves and dense, tufted growth habit, which makes it well adapted to arid and disturbed environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread aggressively, often forming dense mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Hyparrhenia coriacea is also valued for its use in livestock forage and in traditional basket weaving.</p>
