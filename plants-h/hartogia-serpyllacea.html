                    <h1>Hartogia serpyllacea</h1>
<p>Hartogia serpyllacea, commonly known as the coastal bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats on sandy or gravelly soils, often in areas subject to salt spray and strong winds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Hartogia serpyllacea plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
