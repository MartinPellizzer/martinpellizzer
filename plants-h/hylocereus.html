<p>Hylocereus, commonly known as the night blooming cactus, is a genus of flowering plants in the Cactaceae family.</p>
<p>These plants are native to Mexico and Central America, and they are characterized by their spineless stems and nocturnal flowering habits. The flowers, which open at night, are typically white or pale yellow and emit a sweet fragrance. Hylocereus species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and for the fruit they produce, known as dragon fruit.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to thrive in arid conditions makes it well-suited for xeriscaping and sustainable gardening practices.</p>
