                    <h1>Hordeum bulbosum var. brevispicatum</h1>
<p>Hordeum bulbosum var. brevispicatum, commonly known as the dwarf bulbous barley, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and bulbous base, which stores nutrients for survival during harsh conditions. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, each containing several small, leathery grains. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it typically grows in moist, disturbed soils.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
