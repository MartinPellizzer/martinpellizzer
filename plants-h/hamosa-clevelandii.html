<p>Hamosa clevelandii, commonly known as Cleveland's hamosa, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the coastal regions of southern California.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and succulent leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils along the coastline, adapting to the harsh maritime climate. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an important subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental pressures, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful management to ensure its survival.</p>
