                    <h1>Hemionitis complanata</h1>
<p>Hemionitis complanata, commonly known as the flat leaved hemionitis, is a rare and delicate fern native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, closely spaced, and often clustered fronds that form a dense, low-growing mat. The plant has a unique reproductive structure, with sporangia borne on short stalks at the tips of the fronds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a threatened species in many areas.</p>
