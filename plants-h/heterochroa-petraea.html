<p>Heterochroa petraea, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in rocky and arid environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its crustose growth form, which adheres tightly to surfaces. The thallus is typically pale to dark green, with a smooth or slightly wrinkled surface. It contains various secondary metabolites that contribute to its ability to survive in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>This lichen is often used as an indicator species for environmental health due to its sensitivity to pollution.</p>
