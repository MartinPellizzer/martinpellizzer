<p>Hypolepis inermis, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a striking fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, velvety fronds that give it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in soil, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>The plant's unique texture and ornamental value make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor cultivation.</p>
