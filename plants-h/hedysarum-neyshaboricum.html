<p>Hedysarum neyshaboricum, commonly known as the Neyshaboric sweet clover, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. It plays a role in soil fixation due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it ecologically significant in its native range.</p>
