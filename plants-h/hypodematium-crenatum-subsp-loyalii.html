<p>Hypodematium crenatum subsp.</p>
<p>loyalii, commonly known as the Loyal's hairy bladderwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific regions in China. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap microscopic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are slender and often covered in fine, hair-like structures, which contribute to its common name.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
