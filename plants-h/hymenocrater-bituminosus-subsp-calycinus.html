<p>Hymenocrater bituminosus subsp.</p>
<p>calycinus, commonly known as the black-barked lichen, is a foliose lichen characterized by its dark, almost black, upper surface and a lighter, often greyish, lower surface. It typically grows on tree trunks and branches, especially in humid and shaded environments.</p>
<p>The thallus is leathery and has a distinct, almost velvety texture. It contains a variety of secondary metabolites, which contribute to its coloration and ecological interactions.</p>
<p>This lichen is often used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants.</p>
