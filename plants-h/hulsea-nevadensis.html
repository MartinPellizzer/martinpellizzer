                    <h1>Hulsea nevadensis</h1>
<p>Hulsea nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly in high-elevation environments.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in open, rocky areas and is adapted to cold, arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Hulsea nevadensis plays an important role in alpine ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivores.</p>
