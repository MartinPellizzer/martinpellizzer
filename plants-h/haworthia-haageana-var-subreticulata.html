<p>Haworthia haageana var. subreticulata, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>

The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers on tall, slender stems during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
