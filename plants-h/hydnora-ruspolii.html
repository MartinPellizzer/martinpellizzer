                    <h1>Hydnora ruspolii</h1>
<p>Hydnora ruspolii, commonly known as the parasitic flower, is a unique plant species that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it attaches to the roots of other plants and absorbs water and minerals from them. The plant produces a distinctive, often foul-smelling flower that is adapted for pollination by flies. Its structure is simple, with no true leaves or stems, and it is primarily found in southern Africa.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized growth habits and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
