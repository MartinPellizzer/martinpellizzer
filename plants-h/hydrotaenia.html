                    <h1>Hydrotaenia</h1>
<p>Hydrotaenia, commonly known as water ferns, are aquatic or semi-aquatic plants belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>They typically have small, floating or submerged leaves that are often divided into four parts, resembling a cloverleaf shape. These plants are found in freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Their rhizomes help anchor them to the substrate, and they can form dense mats that provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Hydrotaenia species are known for their ability to thrive in nutrient-rich waters and are often indicators of eutrophic conditions.</p>
