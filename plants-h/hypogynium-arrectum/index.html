                            <h1>Hypogynium Arrectum</h1>
<p>Buckthorn, scientifically known as Hypogynium arrectum, is a hardy shrub native to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dark, thorny stems and small, yellowish-green leaves that appear in dense clusters. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, disturbed areas, and along roadsides. Buckthorn plays a vital role in supporting local wildlife, providing shelter and food for various insects and birds. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions, where it outcompetes native vegetation and alters ecosystem dynamics.</p>
