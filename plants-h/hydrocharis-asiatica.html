<p>Hydrocharis asiatica, commonly known as the Asiatic water shield, is a floating aquatic plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water surface. Its roots help stabilize sediment in wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Hydrocharis asiatica is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats.</p>
