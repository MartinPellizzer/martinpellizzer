                    <h1>Huperzia ambrensis</h1>
<p>Huperzia ambrensis, commonly known as the Ambrosia huperzia, is a species of fern-like plant belonging to the family Hypnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered growth habit and needle-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of rhizomes. Native to the tropical regions of South America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant's unique morphology includes a lack of true roots, with its nutrient absorption occurring through the leaf bases.</p>
<p>Huperzia ambrensis is also notable for its ability to form dense mats, which contribute to soil stabilization in its natural habitat.</p>
