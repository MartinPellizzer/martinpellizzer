                    <h1>Heliophila pubescens</h1>
<p>Heliophila pubescens, commonly known as the hairy heliophyte, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marshy environments in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, herbaceous growth habit and produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its moist habitats. It thrives in nutrient-rich soils and is often found in association with other wetland flora.</p>
<p>Heliophila pubescens plays a role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its habitat.</p>
