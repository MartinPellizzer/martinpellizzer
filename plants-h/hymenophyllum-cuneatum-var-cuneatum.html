                    <h1>Hymenophyllum cuneatum var. cuneatum</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum cuneatum var. cuneatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf filmy fern, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It features delicate, linear to lanceolate fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant's spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. It has a distinctive, translucent appearance due to its thin, papery leaves.</p>
<p>This variety is native to parts of Asia and is often found growing on trees or rocks in humid forests.</p>
