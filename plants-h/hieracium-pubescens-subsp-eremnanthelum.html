<p>Hieracium pubescens subsp.</p>
<p>eremnanthelum, commonly known as the desert hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with a rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater, making it well adapted to dry conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in rocky soils and is considered a characteristic species of desert scrub habitats.</p>
