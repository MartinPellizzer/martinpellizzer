<p>Harrisia pomanensis, commonly known as the Pomanesa cactus, is a species of cactus native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, spiny stems that grow in a shrub-like form, often reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are typically yellow or orange in color, which are edible and have a sweet, tangy flavor. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink and bloom during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Harrisia pomanensis is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems and performing photosynthesis through its green, fleshy tissue.</p>
