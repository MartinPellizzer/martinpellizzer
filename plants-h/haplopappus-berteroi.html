                    <h1>Haplopappus berteroi</h1>
<p>Haplopappus berteroi, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial with a fibrous root system adapted to survive in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Haplopappus berteroi is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited to harsh, desert conditions.</p>
