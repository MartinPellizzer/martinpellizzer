                    <h1>Hydrocotyle digitata</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle digitata, commonly known as the water pennywort, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and stream margins. The plant has finely divided, floating or submerged leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and borne in clusters, often emerging from the water surface.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle digitata plays a role in stabilizing aquatic sediments and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
