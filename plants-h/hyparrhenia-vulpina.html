<p>Hyparrhenia vulpina, commonly known as the fox-tail grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its distinctive, fox-like appearance due to its stiff, bristly inflorescence. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as savannas and grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers.</p>
<p>Hyparrhenia vulpina is often used for soil stabilization and has some traditional uses in local communities.</p>
