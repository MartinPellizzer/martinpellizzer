                    <h1>Hartighsea alliaria</h1>
<p>Hartighsea alliaria, commonly known as garlic mustard, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, North Africa, and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are smooth and glossy, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters. The plant is characterized by its strong garlic-like odor, which comes from sulfur compounds in its leaves and flowers. It has a taproot system and can thrive in a variety of soil types, making it an invasive species in many regions.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native plants make it a significant ecological concern.</p>
