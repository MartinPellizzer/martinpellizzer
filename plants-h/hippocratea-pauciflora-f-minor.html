                    <h1>Hippocratea pauciflora f. minor</h1>
<p>Hippocratea pauciflora f. minor, commonly known as the lesser few-flowered hippocratea, is a rare and unique variant of the hippocratea genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and reduced floral display compared to the typical form. The plant features small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, often with a subtle fragrance. Native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of interest in horticultural and conservation studies.</p>
