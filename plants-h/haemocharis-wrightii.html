<p>Haemocharis wrightii, commonly known as the golden torch ginger, is a tropical flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, orange-red bracts that resemble torches, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a contrasting element to its vibrant bracts. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Haemocharis wrightii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its bold and colorful appearance.</p>
