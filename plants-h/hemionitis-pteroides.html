                <h1>Hemionitis pteroides</h1>
<p>Hemionitis pteroides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive, compact growth habit with closely spaced, fiddlehead-like fronds that remain tightly curled throughout much of the year. The plant's leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in rocky soils and can often be found growing on limestone or sandstone substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations, it is considered a valuable indicator species for arid ecosystems.</p>
