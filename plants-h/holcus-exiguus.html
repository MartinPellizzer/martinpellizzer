<p>Holcus exiguus, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, compact clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Holcus exiguus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local insect populations.</p>
