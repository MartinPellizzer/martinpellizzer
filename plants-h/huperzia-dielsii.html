                    <h1>Huperzia dielsii</h1>
<p>Huperzia dielsii, commonly known as the Diels' clubmoss, is a species of fern-like plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a creeping rhizome system that allows it to form dense mats. Native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive reproductive structure called a strobilus, which contains the sporangia for spore production.</p>
<p>Its simple morphology and ancient lineage provide insights into the evolution of early land plants.</p>
