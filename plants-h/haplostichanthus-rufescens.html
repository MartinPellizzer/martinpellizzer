<p>It typically grows on the branches of various host trees, such as eucalypts and acacias, deriving some of its nutrients through specialized roots called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a leathery texture with a reddish hue on the underside.</p>
