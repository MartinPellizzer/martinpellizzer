<p>Hexalectris spicata f. wilderi, commonly known as the wilder's spider orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spider-like flower structure with long, slender petals and a prominent, club-shaped lip. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils within pine flatwoods and scrub habitats. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
