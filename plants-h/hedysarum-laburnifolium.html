<p>Hedysarum laburnifolium, commonly known as the yellow peavine, is a deciduous leguminous plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnate with 9 to 15 pairs of oval-shaped leaflets, giving it a resemblance to laburnum. The plant produces striking yellow pea-like flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its fruits are legumes that mature into cylindrical pods containing several seeds.</p>
<p>Hedysarum laburnifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects.</p>
