                    <h1>Habenaria pinguicula</h1>
<p>Habenaria pinguicula, commonly known as the sticky orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are often covered in a sticky substance, which helps in trapping small insects.</p>
<p>This adaptation aids in nutrient acquisition, as the plant is capable of digesting the trapped prey.</p>
