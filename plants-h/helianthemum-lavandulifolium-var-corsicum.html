<p>Helianthemum lavandulifolium var. corsicum, commonly known as the Corsican rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, adding vibrant color to rocky or coastal habitats.

<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature in garden settings.</p>
