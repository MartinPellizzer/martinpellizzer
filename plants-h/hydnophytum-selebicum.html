                    <h1>Hydnophytum selebicum</h1>
<p>Hydnophytum selebicum, commonly known as the pitcher plant of Sumatra, is a unique carnivorous plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its specialized leaf structures that form pitfall traps to capture and digest insect prey. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Hydnophytum selebicum plays a significant role in its ecosystem by controlling insect populations and contributing to nutrient cycling in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
