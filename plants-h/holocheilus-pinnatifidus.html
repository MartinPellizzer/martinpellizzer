                    <h1>Holocheilus pinnatifidus</h1>
<p>Holocheilus pinnatifidus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnatifid (bifurcated) leaves that float on the surface of water. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its fronds are typically green and can grow up to 30 cm in length, providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Holocheilus pinnatifidus plays a role in water filtration and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
