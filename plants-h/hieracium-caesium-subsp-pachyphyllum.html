<p>Hieracium caesium subsp.</p>
<p>pachyphyllum, commonly known as the thick-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-forming basal leaves that are thick and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Compositae family. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
