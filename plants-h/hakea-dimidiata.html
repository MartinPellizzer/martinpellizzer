                    <h1>Hakea dimidiata</h1>
<p>Hakea dimidiata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are usually grey-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces cylindrical, woody flower spikes that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its seeds are enclosed in woody follicles that open to release them, aiding in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Hakea dimidiata is valued for its hardy nature and is often used in landscaping in dry climates.</p>
