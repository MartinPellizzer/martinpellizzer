<p>Halothamnus bamianicus, commonly known as the Bamian Himalayan tamarisk, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it plays a role in stabilizing soils in harsh, high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
