<p>Heliosperma chromodontum, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a succulent plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems for survival in arid environments.</p>
<p>Heliosperma chromodontum is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
