<p>Hordeum bulbosum, commonly known as bulbous barley, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and compact, bulbous base that stores nutrients for regrowth. The plant produces spikelets that bear small, two-lobed flowers, typically green to reddish in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Hordeum bulbosum is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
