                    <h1>Helianthella iostephanoides</h1>
<p>Helianthella iostephanoides, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial with a rosette of gray-green, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects in desert ecosystems.</p>
