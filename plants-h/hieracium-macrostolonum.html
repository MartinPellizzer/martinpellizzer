<p>Hieracium macrostolonum, commonly known as the giant hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant features a robust, creeping stolon system that allows it to spread aggressively across open areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and often have a reddish tint, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in dense clusters.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats.</p>
