                    <h1>Hydnophytum formicarum montanum</h1>
<p>Hydnophytum formicarum montanum, commonly known as the ant plant, is a tropical epiphytic species belonging to the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique structure, with hollow stems that serve as shelter for ants, which in turn provide protection against herbivores. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with certain ant species, particularly those of the genus Pheidole, which reside within its stem cavities. Its leaves are typically elliptical and arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>This plant is native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia and is often found growing on tree branches in humid, shaded environments.</p>
