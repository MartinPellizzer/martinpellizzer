                    <h1>Haloxylon stocksii</h1>
<p>Haloxylon stocksii, commonly known as the sandmat, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to extreme desert conditions, with small, waxy leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. The plant produces small, pale green or yellow flowers, typically blooming in spring. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-resistant.</p>
<p>Haloxylon stocksii plays a crucial role in stabilizing sandy soils and preventing desertification in its native habitats.</p>
