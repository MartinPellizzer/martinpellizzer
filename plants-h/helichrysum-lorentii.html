<p>Helichrysum lorentii, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that remain open for extended periods, giving it a "everlasting" appearance. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Helichrysum lorentii is also valued for its ornamental use in gardens and for its historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
