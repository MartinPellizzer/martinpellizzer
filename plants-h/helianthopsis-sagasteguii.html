<p>Helianthopsis sagasteguii, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features compact, silver-gray foliage with a dense, mat-like growth habit that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves and stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in low-nutrient soils.</p>
<p>Helianthopsis sagasteguii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
