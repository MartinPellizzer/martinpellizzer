                    <h1>Hypericum perforatum var. nanum</h1>
<p>Hypericum perforatum var. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and opposite, oval-shaped leaves with translucent dots. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. It is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its compact growth habit.</p>
<p>Its medicinal properties are similar to those of the common St. John's wort, though it is less widely studied.</p>
