<p>Haworthia margaritifera var. laevior, commonly known as the "Pearl Plant," is a compact, evergreen succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves with white tubercles that resemble small pearls, giving it its common name. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped white flowers on slender stems during the spring or summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections.</p>
