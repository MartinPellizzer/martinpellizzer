<p>Helianthemum chamaecistus var. arcticum, commonly known as Arctic sandthrift, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It features compact, silver-gray foliage that is densely packed, providing excellent erosion control on rocky and sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners in colder climates.</p>
