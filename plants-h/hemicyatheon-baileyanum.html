                    <h1>Hemicyatheon baileyanum</h1>
<p>Hemicyatheon baileyanum, commonly known as the Baileyanum cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. Native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil. Its reproductive structures include a large, cone-like male strobilus and a smaller, female ovulate cone, typical of cycads.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overcollection, Hemicyatheon baileyanum is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
