                    <h1>Harrisia eriophora</h1>
<p>Harrisia eriophora, commonly known as the red-fleshed cactus, is a species native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive red or pinkish coloration on its outer skin, which is often mistaken for fruit. The plant features areoles, which are the points from which spines, flowers, and branches emerge. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths.</p>
<p>The cactus is adapted to arid environments and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
