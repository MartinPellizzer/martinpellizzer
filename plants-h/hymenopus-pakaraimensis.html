                    <h1>Hymenopus pakaraimensis</h1>
<p>Hymenopus pakaraimensis, commonly known as the Pakaraima star-flower, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the high-altitude grasslands of the Pakaraima Mountains in Guyana.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its star-shaped white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom during the cooler months. The plant has a compact, low-growing habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely packed around its basal rosette. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying biodiversity in isolated ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to habitat degradation, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts in its native range.</p>
