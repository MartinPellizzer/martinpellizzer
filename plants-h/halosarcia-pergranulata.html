                    <h1>Halosarcia pergranulata</h1>
<p>Halosarcia pergranulata, commonly known as the granulated halosarcia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, a common adaptation in succulents to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Halosarcia pergranulata is often found growing in rocky soils and is well-suited for cultivation in dry, well-drained gardens.</p>
