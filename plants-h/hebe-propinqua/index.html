                            <h1>Hebe Propinqua</h1>
<p>Hebe propinqua is a small, evergreen shrub native to the rugged mountainous regions of New Zealand. It is known for its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of purple and blue during the spring and summer months. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its compact growth habit and vibrant blooms make it a favorite among horticulturists and garden enthusiasts. Despite its beauty, Hebe propinqua is relatively rare in cultivation, requiring specific care to flourish.</p>
