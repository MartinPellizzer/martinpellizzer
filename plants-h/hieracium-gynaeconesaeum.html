<p>Hieracium gynaeconesaeum, commonly known as the female-hair dandelion, is a rare and unique species of hawkweed native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellow flowers and a distinctive, hairy stem that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually short-lived, blooming in late spring to early summer, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
