                    <h1>Hypolepis stenophylla</h1>
<p>Hypolepis stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf huperzia, is a fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its fronds, typical of the Huperziaceae family. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
