                    <h1>Hydnora johannis</h1>
<p>Hydnora johannis, commonly known as the desert hydnora, is a parasitic flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It lacks true leaves and chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host plant for nutrients. The plant produces a distinctive, fleshy, reddish-purple flower that emits a strong odor to attract pollinators. It is often found growing on the roots of shrubs like Ruspolia.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
