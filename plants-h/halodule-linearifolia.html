                    <h1>Halodule linearifolia</h1>
<p>Halodule linearifolia, commonly known as shoal grass, is a seagrass species found in shallow coastal waters of the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States.</p>
<p>It has long, narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. The plant forms dense underwater meadows that provide critical habitat and nursery grounds for various marine species. Halodule linearifolia reproduces both sexually through flowers and asexually through rhizomes, allowing it to spread rapidly in suitable environments.</p>
<p>Its presence is an indicator of water quality and plays a vital role in stabilizing sediments and maintaining coastal ecosystems.</p>
