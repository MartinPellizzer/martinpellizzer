                    <h1>Hieracium mnoocladum</h1>
<p>Hieracium mnoocladum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in composite flower heads, typical of the daisy family, and has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it can outcompete native flora and is sometimes considered a weed.</p>
