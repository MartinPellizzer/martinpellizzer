<p>St. john's wort, scientifically known as Hypericum perforatum subsp. microphyllum, is a flowering plant native to europe and parts of asia. it is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and distinctive leaves with tiny translucent dots. this subspecies is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. it has been used for centuries in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits. its name derives from the belief that it was blessed by st. john during the summer solstice.</p>
