<p>Hyacinthus nivalis, commonly known as the snowdrop, is a perennial bulbous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, nodding flowers that bloom in early spring, typically before the leaves appear. The plant produces a cluster of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, green, and yellow. Its leaves are long, narrow, and grass-like, emerging after the flowers.</p>
<p>The snowdrop is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in woodland areas and along rocky paths.</p>
