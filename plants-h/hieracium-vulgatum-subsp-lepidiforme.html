<p>Hieracium vulgatum subsp.</p>
<p>lepidiforme, commonly known as the showy hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and yellowish to orange flower heads.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine, soft hairs, while the flowers are arranged in a flat, disk-like structure.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often mistaken for other hawkweed species due to its similar appearance but can be distinguished by its specific leaf and flower characteristics.</p>
