                    <h1>Heterocentron evansii</h1>
<p>Heterocentron evansii, commonly known as the Evans' bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic prey, primarily tiny crustaceans and insect larvae. The plant has thin, branching stems and produces tiny, green, floating leaves. It thrives in nutrient-poor waters, using its specialized structures to supplement its nutrient intake.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations make it an important indicator species for aquatic ecosystem health.</p>
