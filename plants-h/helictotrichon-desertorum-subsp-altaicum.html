<p>Helictotrichon desertorum subsp.</p>
<p>altaicum, commonly known as the desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in low-nutrient soils and extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
