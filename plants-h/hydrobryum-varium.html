<p>Hydrobryum varium, commonly known as the variable water moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, mat-forming plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or soil surfaces. The plant has a thalloid structure with a distinct dorsal and ventral surface, and it lacks true roots, stems, and leaves. Hydrobryum varium is characterized by its variable morphology, which can include different leaf shapes and sizes depending on environmental conditions.</p>
