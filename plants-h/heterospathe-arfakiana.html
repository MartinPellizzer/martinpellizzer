<p>Heterospathe arfakiana, commonly known as the Arfak mountain fern, is a species of fern native to the highland regions of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into narrow, linear segments, giving it a delicate and intricate appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky or shaded areas. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, Heterospathe arfakiana is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
