                    <h1>Helichrysum calocladum</h1>
<p>Helichrysum calocladum, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that resemble tiny suns. The plant produces papery, persistent bracts that remain after the flowers have faded, giving it a long-lasting appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators.</p>
