<p>Helianthemum × pseudodianicum, commonly known as the hybrid rockrose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It features small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring, typically in clusters at the ends of its branched stems. The plant has leathery, elliptical leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>This species is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
