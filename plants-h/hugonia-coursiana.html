                    <h1>Hugonia coursiana</h1>
<p>Hugonia coursiana, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and riparian zones in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features elongated, narrow leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in water-saturated soils, making it an important species in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Hugonia coursiana plays a role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
