                    <h1>Hemionitis intramarginalis</h1>
<p>Hemionitis intramarginalis, commonly known as the marginal hemionitis, is a small, terrestrial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in rocky crevices or among dry, sandy soils, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating spore dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, Hemionitis intramarginalis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
