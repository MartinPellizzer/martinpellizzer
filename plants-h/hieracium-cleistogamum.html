                    <h1>Hieracium cleistogamum</h1>
<p>Hieracium cleistogamum, commonly known as the cleistogamous hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the production of both open and closed (cleistogamous) flowers. The cleistogamous flowers are self-pollinated and do not open, while the open flowers are typically pollinated by insects. This species is native to Europe and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on reproductive strategies in plants.</p>
