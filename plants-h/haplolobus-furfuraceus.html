                    <h1>Haplolobus furfuraceus</h1>
<p>Haplolobus furfuraceus, commonly known as the hairy lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits a unique combination of fungal and algal components.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lecanoraceae and is characterized by its dense, hairy growth form, which gives it its common name. The plant's thallus is typically crustose or foliose, with a rough, uneven surface covered in short, branched hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on bark or soil surfaces in temperate regions.</p>
<p>The lichen's symbiotic relationship between the fungus and algae allows it to efficiently absorb nutrients and water from its surroundings.</p>
