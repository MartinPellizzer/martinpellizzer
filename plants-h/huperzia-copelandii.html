                    <h1>Huperzia copelandii</h1>
<p>Huperzia copelandii, commonly known as the Copeland's huperzia, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clustered, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in small, spore-producing structures called sporangia. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its spore-based reproduction is a key feature of its life cycle, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
