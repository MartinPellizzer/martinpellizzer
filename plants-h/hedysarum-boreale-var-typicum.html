<p>Hedysarum boreale var. typicum, commonly known as the northern vetch, is a perennial legume native to northern regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and along riverbanks. The plant produces slender, erect stems with trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Its seeds are enclosed in hairy pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind and animals.</p>
<p>Hedysarum boreale var. typicum plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats.</p>
