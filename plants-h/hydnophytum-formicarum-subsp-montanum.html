<p>Hydnophytum formicarum subsp.</p>
<p>montanum, commonly known as the ant plant, is a climbing epiphytic shrub native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring hollow stems that house colonies of ants.</p>
<p>The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with its resident ants, providing them with shelter and food while defending itself against herbivores. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its ecological role in supporting ant communities and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat.</p>
