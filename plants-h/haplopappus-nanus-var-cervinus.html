                    <h1>Haplopappus nanus var. cervinus</h1>
<p>Haplopappus nanus var. cervinus, commonly known as the dwarf pappus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically features compact, mat-forming growth with small, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, bristly seeds that are adapted for wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
