<p>Hemistepta, commonly known as the "sicklepod" or "bitterbush," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically shrubs or small trees native to the Americas, particularly Central and South America. They are characterized by their compound leaves and small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Hemistepta species often have a woody stem and can thrive in a variety of soil types, though they prefer well-drained conditions.</p>
