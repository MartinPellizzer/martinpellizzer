                    <h1>Holodiscus</h1>
<p>Holodiscus, commonly known as the golden disc or false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico, where it thrives in dry, open habitats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are arranged in a disc-like structure, giving it its common name. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Holodiscus is often used in ornamental gardening due to its delicate appearance and drought tolerance.</p>
