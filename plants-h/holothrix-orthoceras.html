                    <h1>Holothrix orthoceras</h1>
<p>Holothrix orthoceras, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a unique lichen that forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga.</p>
<p>It typically grows on rocky surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments, where it can tolerate extreme conditions. The plant's structure consists of a dense, crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to the substrate. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead relying on its symbiotic partners for nutrients and photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Holothrix orthoceras plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other organisms in its ecosystem.</p>
