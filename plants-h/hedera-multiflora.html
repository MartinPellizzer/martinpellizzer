                    <h1>Hedera multiflora</h1>
<p>Hedera multiflora, commonly known as the Persian ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features dark green, glossy leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate, with a slightly wavy margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are not particularly showy, followed by dark blue to black berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to cover vertical spaces.</p>
<p>Hedera multiflora is also valued for its air-purifying properties and resilience in various soil conditions.</p>
