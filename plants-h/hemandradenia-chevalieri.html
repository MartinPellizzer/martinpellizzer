                    <h1>Hemandradenia chevalieri</h1>
<p>Hemandradenia chevalieri, commonly known as the Cape York rock fig, is a flowering plant native to northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is a small, shrub-like species with thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions of Queensland.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
