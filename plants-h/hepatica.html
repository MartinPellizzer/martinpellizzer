                    <h1>Hepatica</h1>
<p>Hepatica, commonly known as the liverleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately divided leaves that resemble a liver, hence its common name. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of white, blue, or purple, typically blooming in early spring. Hepatica thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>Its early blooming habit makes it an important early food source for pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
