                    <h1>Hohenbergia</h1>
<p>Hohenbergia, commonly known as the star orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Bromeliaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to South America, particularly Brazil, and are characterized by their rosette-shaped leaves that form a cup-like structure to collect rainwater. The leaves are typically thick and fleshy, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Hohenbergia species produce showy, spike-like inflorescences with small, colorful flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow.</p>
<p>They are popular as ornamental plants due to their striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
