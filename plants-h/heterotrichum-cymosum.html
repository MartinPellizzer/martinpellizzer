<p>Heterotrichum cymosum, commonly known as the clustered moss, is a small, cushion-like moss that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a dense, mat-forming growth habit with closely packed, erect shoots. The leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth, glossy surface and a slightly curled tip. It reproduces via spores, which are released from capsules that develop on the stems.</p>
<p>This species is often found in forest floors and rock crevices, contributing to soil stabilization and moisture retention.</p>
