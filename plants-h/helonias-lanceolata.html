                    <h1>Helonias lanceolata</h1>
<p>Helonias lanceolata, commonly known as the swamp bladderwort, is a flowering plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Lentibulariaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils and its unique method of nutrient acquisition through its specialized leaves that trap small aquatic organisms. Helonias lanceolata typically blooms from June to August, and it plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to biodiversity and nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>Its presence is often an indicator of healthy, undisturbed wetland habitats.</p>
