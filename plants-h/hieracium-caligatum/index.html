                            <h1>Hieracium Caligatum</h1>
<p>Mouse-ear hawkweed, scientifically known as Hieracium caligatum, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers and fuzzy, mouse-ear shaped leaves. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. While it is often considered a weed, it plays a role in supporting local pollinators. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
