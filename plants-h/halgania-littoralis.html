                    <h1>Halgania littoralis</h1>
<p>Halgania littoralis, commonly known as the coastal halgania, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found along the edges of lagoons and estuaries.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability to salt spray and wind, it plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
