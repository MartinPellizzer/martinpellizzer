                    <h1>Hakea erinacea</h1>
<p>Hakea erinacea, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, woody stems and dense, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in winter, which are clustered in cylindrical spikes. Its seed capsules are woody and split open to release seeds, often dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Hakea erinacea is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it a resilient species in harsh environments.</p>
