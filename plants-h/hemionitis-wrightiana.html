                    <h1>Hemionitis wrightiana</h1>
<p>Hemionitis wrightiana, commonly known as Wright's hemionitis, is a rare and delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, finely divided leaves that form a dense, low-growing mat. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in cloud forests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing leaves, are typically found on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
