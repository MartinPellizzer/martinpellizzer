<p>Hieracium jurassicum subsp.</p>
<p>constrictiforme, commonly known as the Jurassic hawkweed, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>This subspecies is typically found in specific microhabitats, often in calcareous soils, which support its unique ecological requirements. Its morphology includes a low-growing habit with multiple flowering stems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat needs, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered plant.</p>
