<p>Hemionitis straminea, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a small evergreen fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features delicate, bright green, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is characterized by its unique, clustered sori that are covered with a protective indusium.</p>
