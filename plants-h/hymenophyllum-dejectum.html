<p>Hymenophyllum dejectum, commonly known as the drooping fern, is a species of moss-like fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often appear as a carpet on tree trunks and rocks. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are closely spaced and have a leathery texture, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum dejectum plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
