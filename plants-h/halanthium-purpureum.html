<p>Halanthium purpureum, commonly known as the purple water flea, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Zosteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branching structure and the presence of specialized air-filled bladders that help it float. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are thin and ribbon-like, often with a reddish or purplish hue, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>Halanthium purpureum plays a minor role in aquatic ecosystems, primarily as a food source for small invertebrates and fish.</p>
