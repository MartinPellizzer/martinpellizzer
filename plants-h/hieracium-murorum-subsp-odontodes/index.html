                            <h1>Hieracium Murorum Subsp. Odontodes</h1>
<p>Hieracium murorum subsp. odontodes is a lesser-known member of the dandelion family known for its striking yellow flowers and robust growth. This subspecies thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides. Its unique tooth-like markings on the petals give it a distinctive appearance that sets it apart from other hawkweeds. Despite its beauty, it remains underappreciated in both horticulture and ecological studies. Understanding this plant offers insights into the adaptability and resilience of wild flora.</p>
