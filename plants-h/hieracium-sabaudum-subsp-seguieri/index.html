                            <h1>Hieracium Sabaudum Subsp. Seguieri</h1>
<p>Lesser spear thistle, scientifically known as Hieracium sabaudum subsp. seguieri, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the sunflower family, Asteraceae, and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. This species is characterized by its spiny leaves and yellow flower heads that bloom in late summer. Though it may appear unattractive, it plays an important role in supporting pollinators and maintaining ecological balance. Its unique features make it both a subject of botanical interest and a symbol of resilience in natural landscapes.</p>
