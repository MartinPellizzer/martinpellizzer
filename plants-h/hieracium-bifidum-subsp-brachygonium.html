<p>Hieracium bifidum subsp.</p>
<p>brachygonium, commonly known as the short-stalked hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>The plant features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, while its flowering stems bear small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite inflorescence. It produces numerous seeds enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its compact growth habit and is often found in moist or sandy soils.</p>
