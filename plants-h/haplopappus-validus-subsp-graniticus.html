<p>Haplopappus validus subsp.</p>
<p>graniticus, commonly known as the granitic haper, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky environments in western North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and gray-green foliage adapted to withstand harsh, dry conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and flies. Its fibrous roots help it retain moisture in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found on granitic outcrops and is well-suited to the extreme conditions of its native habitat.</p>
