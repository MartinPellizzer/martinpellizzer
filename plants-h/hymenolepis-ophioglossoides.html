<p>Hymenolepis ophioglossoides, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and small, bladder-like structures that help it float and trap microscopic organisms. The plant is typically found in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female structures, and it reproduces both sexually and asexually.</p>
<p>Hymenolepis ophioglossoides plays a minor role in aquatic ecosystems but is an indicator species for nutrient-rich waters.</p>
