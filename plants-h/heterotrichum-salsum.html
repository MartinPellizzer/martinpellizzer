<p>Heterotrichum salsum, commonly known as the salt marsh moss, is a species of liverwort that thrives in saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, closely packed leaves and is often found in coastal areas where saltwater meets land. The plant has a simple thalloid structure, which allows it to tolerate high salinity levels. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in salt marsh ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized adaptations, Heterotrichum salsum is an indicator species for coastal habitats.</p>
