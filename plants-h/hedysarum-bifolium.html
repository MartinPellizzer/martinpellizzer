<p>Hedysarum bifolium, commonly known as the two-leaved vetch, is a flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and western Asia and typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple, which attract pollinators like bees. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with two leaflets, giving it the species name "bifolium.".</p>
<p>Hedysarum bifolium is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
