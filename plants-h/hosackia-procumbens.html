<p>Hosackia procumbens, commonly known as the plains coreopsis, is a herbaceous perennial native to the central and eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. Its bright yellow flowers, which bloom in early summer, attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature.</p>
