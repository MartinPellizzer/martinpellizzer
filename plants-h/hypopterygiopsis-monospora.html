                <h1>Hypopterygiopsis monospora</h1>
<p>Hypopterygiopsis monospora, commonly known as the single-spore hypopterygiopsis, is a rare and specialized liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate thallus that typically grows on moist, shaded rocky surfaces in temperate regions. The plant produces a single spore per sporocarp, which is an unusual reproductive feature among liverworts. Its morphology includes a differentiated gametophyte with distinct leaf-like structures called phyllodes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Hypopterygiopsis monospora is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
