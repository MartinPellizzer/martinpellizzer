<p>Hieracium saxifragum subsp.</p>
<p>lythrodes, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its subspecies distinction is based on subtle differences in leaf morphology and flowering patterns.</p>
<p>It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies.</p>
