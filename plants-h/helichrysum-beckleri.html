<p>Helichrysum beckleri, commonly known as the Cape goldcup, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its showy, bright yellow to orange flowers that resemble small cups. The plant produces small, bracteate flower heads that are often mistaken for flowers, and it is well adapted to dry, rocky environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Helichrysum beckleri is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
