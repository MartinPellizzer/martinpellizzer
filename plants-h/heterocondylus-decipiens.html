                    <h1>Heterocondylus decipiens</h1>
<p>Heterocondylus decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive leafy spurge, is a flowering plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters called cyathia, which are typical of the spurge family. It is an invasive species that can outcompete native vegetation in disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and rhizomes make it a challenging weed to control.</p>
