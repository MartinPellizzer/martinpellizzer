                    <h1>Hulsea nana</h1>
<p>Hulsea nana, commonly known as the dwarf hulsea, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of foliage close to the ground, with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, which bloom in late summer. Hulsea nana thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ability to withstand harsh climatic conditions make it an important component of polar ecosystems.</p>
