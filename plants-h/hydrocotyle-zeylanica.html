                    <h1>Hydrocotyle zeylanica</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle zeylanica, commonly known as Indian water shield, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has rounded, waxy leaves that remain just above the water surface, aiding in photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the summer months. Its roots are anchored in the sediment, allowing it to spread across water bodies.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle zeylanica plays a role in stabilizing water ecosystems and providing habitat for aquatic life.</p>
