                    <h1>Hirtella myrmecophila</h1>
<p>Hirtella myrmecophila, commonly known as the antplant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and specialized structures called domatia, which provide shelter for ants. These ants, in turn, protect the plant from herbivores and other pests. The plant is native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil and thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its small white or pink flowers are followed by small, round fruits that contain seeds dispersed by animals.</p>
