<p>Habenaria pseudorepens, commonly known as the creeping lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a dense spike of small, white or pale pink flowers. Its root system consists of a central tuber and fibrous roots, which help it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>
