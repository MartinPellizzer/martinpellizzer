                    <h1>Huperzia killipii</h1>
<p>Huperzia killipii, commonly known as the Killip's spikemoss, is a species of fern-like plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, scale-like leaves that form dense, mat-like growths. Native to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and Georgia, it thrives in moist, acidic soils within shaded, forested environments. The plant reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its sporophytes are often found in clusters on the forest floor.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Huperzia killipii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
