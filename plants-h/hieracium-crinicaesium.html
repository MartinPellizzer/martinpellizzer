<p>Hieracium crinicaesium, commonly known as the silky hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features a creeping rhizome system, allowing it to spread aggressively in moist, disturbed soils. Its leaves are typically basal, with a rough, hairy texture, and its flowers are yellow with ray florets.</p>
<p>It is often considered a weed in agricultural and garden settings due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies.</p>
