<p>It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is native to regions with slow-moving or still freshwater bodies. The plant's leaves are typically green and semi-transparent, allowing light to penetrate for photosynthesis. It reproduces through vegetative propagation, forming dense mats that can stabilize water sediments.</p>
<p>This species is often found in wetlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
