<p>Hypolepis ambigua, commonly known as the false fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble those of true ferns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid climates.</p>
