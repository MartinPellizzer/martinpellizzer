                    <h1>Horsfieldia fulva var. paludicola</h1>
<p>Horsfieldia fulva var. paludicola, commonly known as the swampy horsfieldia, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, lowland forest environments, particularly in swampy or peatland areas. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and typically yellow or greenish-yellow, arranged in dense clusters.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its adaptation to wet, nutrient-poor soils, which influences its growth habits and ecological niche.</p>
