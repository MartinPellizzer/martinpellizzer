<p>Hymenophyllum diversilabium, commonly known as the variable fernlet, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, moss-like appearance and is typically found growing on shaded, moist rock surfaces or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped fronds with a dense covering of tiny, scale-like structures called trichomes. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum diversilabium is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in humid, shaded environments.</p>
