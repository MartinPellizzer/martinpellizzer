<p>Halimium occidentale var. incanum, commonly known as the silver carpet or silver flax, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming growth with silvery-gray foliage due to fine, white hairs covering the leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental touch. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense ground cover make it a valuable plant for stabilizing soil in arid environments.</p>
