                    <h1>Heteropterys imperata</h1>
<p>Heteropterys imperata, commonly known as the common grassvetch, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in spikes, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. Heteropterys imperata is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in fields, and is adapted to thrive in poor, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules makes it an important plant in soil enrichment.</p>
