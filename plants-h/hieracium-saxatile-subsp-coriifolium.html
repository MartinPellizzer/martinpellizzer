<p>Hieracium saxatile subsp.</p>
<p>coriifolium, commonly known as the saxatile hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and tall, branched flowering stems.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically coriaceous, meaning they are thick and leathery, which helps the plant retain moisture in harsh environments. It produces yellow flowers in composite inflorescences, typical of the Asteraceae family, and is often found growing in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often seen in mountainous areas where it thrives in full sun.</p>
