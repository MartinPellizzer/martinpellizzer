<p>Humulus vulgaris, commonly known as hops, is a climbing plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cannabaceae family and is characterized by its prickly stems and cone-shaped flowers called strobiles. The plant is widely cultivated for its use in brewing beer, where the female flowers are used to impart bitterness, aroma, and stability. Hops also contain compounds like lupulin, which contribute to their medicinal and pesticidal properties.</p>
