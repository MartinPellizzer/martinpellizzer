                    <h1>Hemionitis calidirupium</h1>
<p>Hemionitis calidirupium, commonly known as the hot rock fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to specific regions of China.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to high temperatures and low humidity. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth form with small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss. Its spores are released in a specialized structure called a sorus, which is typically found on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
