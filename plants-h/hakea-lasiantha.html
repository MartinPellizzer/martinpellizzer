<p>Hakea lasiantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces striking, cone-shaped inflorescences that bear bright red or orange flowers, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Hakea lasiantha is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its ornamental appeal in gardens.</p>
