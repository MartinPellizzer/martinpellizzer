<p>Hakea attenuata, commonly known as the slender hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Western Australia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, urn-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by woody, cone-like fruits containing seeds. Hakea attenuata is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for coastal and sandy soils.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat.</p>
