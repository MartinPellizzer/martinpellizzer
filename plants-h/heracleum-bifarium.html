                    <h1>Heracleum bifarium</h1>
<p>Heracleum bifarium, commonly known as the two-leaved cow parsnip, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial plant that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils across temperate regions of North America. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves with prominent veins and a distinctive, hollow stem that is often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in umbrella-like clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps.</p>
<p>Heracleum bifarium is often mistaken for poison hemlock due to its similar appearance, but it is generally less toxic and can be found in open woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
