                    <h1>Heliotropium boissieri</h1>
<p>Heliotropium boissieri, commonly known as the desert heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with hairy, fleshy stems that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically violet or blue in color, which bloom in response to sunlight. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Heliotropium boissieri is adapted to survive in harsh, semi-desert conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
