                    <h1>Haloxylon negevensis</h1>
<p>Haloxylon negevensis, commonly known as the Negev haloxylon, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Israel and the Negev Desert.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, hard fruits containing seeds. It is adapted to survive in saline and alkaline soils, making it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in arid areas.</p>
