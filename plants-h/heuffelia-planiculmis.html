<p>Heuffelia planiculmis, commonly known as the smooth-leafed heuffelia, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, smooth-edged leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of many members of its family. Heuffelia planiculmis is native to specific regions in southern Africa, where it thrives in moist, shaded habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.</p>
