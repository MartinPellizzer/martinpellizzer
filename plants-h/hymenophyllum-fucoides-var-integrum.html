<p>Hymenophyllum fucoides var. integrum, commonly known as the green fern, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, moss-like hairs. The plant belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is known for its unique ability to retain moisture, which is essential for its survival. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variety is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
