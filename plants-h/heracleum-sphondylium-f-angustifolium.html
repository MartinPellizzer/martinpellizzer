                    <h1>Heracleum sphondylium f. angustifolium</h1>
<p>Heracleum sphondylium f. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved hogweed, is a variant of the common hogweed species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical form. The plant produces umbrella-shaped clusters of small white flowers, which bloom in late summer. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap and tall stature, it can be invasive and requires careful management.</p>
