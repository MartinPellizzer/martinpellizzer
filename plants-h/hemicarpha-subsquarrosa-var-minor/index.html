                            <h1>Hemicarpha Subsquarrosa Var. Minor</h1>
<p>Prairie dropseed, scientifically known as Hemicarpha subsquarrosa var. minor, is a low-growing grass native to the tallgrass prairie regions of North America. It thrives in open, sunny habitats with well-drained soils, often found in disturbed areas and along roadsides. Its slender stems and delicate, feathery seed heads give it a graceful appearance, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens. This hardy plant is well adapted to the harsh conditions of the prairie, including drought and extreme temperature fluctuations. Despite its modest size, Prairie dropseed plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining ecological balance.</p>
