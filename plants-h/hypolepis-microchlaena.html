<p>Hypolepis microchlaena, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clustered, evergreen foliage.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, or sorus, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
