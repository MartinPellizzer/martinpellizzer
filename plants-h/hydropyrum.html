<p>Hydropyrum, commonly known as the water plantain, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Alismataceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and broad, arrow-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The flowers are typically small and clustered in spadices, with a greenish-white coloration. Hydropyrum species are adapted to wetlands, marshes, and slow-moving water bodies, and they play a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various organisms.</p>
<p>These plants are also used in traditional medicine and can be found in parts of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
