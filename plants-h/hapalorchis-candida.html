                    <h1>Hapalorchis candida</h1>
<p>Hapalorchis candida, commonly known as the white liver fluke, is a parasitic flatworm belonging to the family Hapalorchidae.</p>
<p>It is primarily found in the bile ducts of freshwater fish, particularly in the genus Cyprinidae. The adult fluke has a distinctive elongated body with a broad, flattened shape and a smooth, translucent tegument. Its life cycle involves intermediate hosts such as snails and copepods, with the definitive host being various fish species.</p>
<p>The parasite's morphology and reproductive structures are adapted for survival in the aquatic environment and for transmitting to its host through ingestion of infected prey.</p>
