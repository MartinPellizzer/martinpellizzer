                    <h1>Heterochaeta gnaphalioides</h1>
<p>Heterochaeta gnaphalioides, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It has succulent, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with four petals, typically in shades of white or pale pink. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in rocky outcrops or along coastal dunes.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
