                    <h1>Heliconia excelsa</h1>
<p>Heliconia excelsa, commonly known as the giant heliconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, colorful bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers inside the bracts, which are pollinated by birds such as hummingbirds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Heliconia excelsa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
