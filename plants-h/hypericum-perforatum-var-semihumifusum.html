                    <h1>Hypericum perforatum var. semihumifusum</h1>
<p>Hypericum perforatum var. semihumifusum, commonly known as the semi-humifusum St. John's wort, is a variant of the widely recognized St. John's wort species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and leaves with translucent dots, which are visible when held up to light. This variant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its botanical features include narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a compact growth habit.</p>
<p>While it shares many traits with the common St. John's wort, it is less widely studied and less commonly cultivated.</p>
