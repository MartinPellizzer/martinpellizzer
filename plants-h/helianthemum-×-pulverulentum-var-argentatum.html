<p>Helianthemum × pulverulentum var. argentatum, commonly known as silver rockrose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch of color to rocky or sandy soils. Native to the Mediterranean region, this plant thrives in well-drained, sunny conditions and is highly drought-tolerant. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover in xeriscaped landscapes.</p>
<p>The varietal name 'argentatum' refers to its distinctive silvery appearance, which is due to the fine, white hairs covering the leaves.</p>
