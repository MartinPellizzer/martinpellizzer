                    <h1>Haemanthus hydrophilus</h1>
<p>Haemanthus hydrophilus, commonly known as the water haemanthus, is a striking plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of glossy, dark green leaves that form a dense, water-retaining structure. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, often in late winter or early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ability to store water, it is a popular choice for shady garden settings.</p>
