                    <h1>Hieracium × incertum</h1>
<p>Hieracium × incertum, commonly known as the uncertain hawkweed, is a hybrid plant species within the genus Hieracium, which belongs to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellow to orange composite flowers, which are typically arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. The plant is perennial and often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, across Europe and parts of Asia. It has serrated leaves and produces seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a wide range of morphological variation, making it challenging to classify definitively.</p>
