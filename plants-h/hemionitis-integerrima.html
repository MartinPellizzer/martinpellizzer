                    <h1>Hemionitis integerrima</h1>
<p>Hemionitis integerrima, commonly known as the rock fern, is a unique plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or brown, which are followed by spore-bearing structures called sorus. Hemionitis integerrima is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with a deep root system that helps it retain moisture.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in such conditions makes it an important species for ecological studies in arid ecosystems.</p>
