                    <h1>Hakea formosa</h1>
<p>Hakea formosa, commonly known as the pink hakea, is a shrub native to south-western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical or cylindrical-branching structure and its striking pink or red flowers that appear in spring. The leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. The plant produces woody, cone-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>Hakea formosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance and hardiness.</p>
