<p>It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves with elongated, pointed leaflets and striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal.</p>
