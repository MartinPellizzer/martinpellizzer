<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are fibrous and often grow in loose soil, adapting to its natural habitat in forest understories.</p>
<p>The orchid's flowers are usually pink or purple, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
