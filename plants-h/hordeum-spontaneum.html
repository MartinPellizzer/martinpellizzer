<p>Hordeum spontaneum, commonly known as wild barley, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and small, pale blue to greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open fields, along roadsides, and in arid environments. Its seeds are small and oval, with a tough, protective hull that aids in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Hordeum spontaneum is an important plant in ecological studies due to its role in soil stabilization and its historical significance in the domestication of barley.</p>
