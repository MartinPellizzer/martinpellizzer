<p>Habenaria allemanii, commonly known as the Alleman's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a loose raceme, which are typically borne on the upper part of the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
