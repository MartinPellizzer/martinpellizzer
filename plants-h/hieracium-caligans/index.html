                            <h1>Hieracium Caligans</h1>
<p>Field hawkweed, scientifically known as Hieracium caligans, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the sunflower family, Asteraceae, and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. This perennial weed is characterized by its dandelion-like yellow flowers and hairy stems, which help it survive in harsh environments. Despite its common presence, it is often overlooked for its ecological importance in supporting pollinators and soil stability. Its resilience and adaptability make it a significant species in its native habitats.</p>
