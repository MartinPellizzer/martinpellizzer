<p>Haplopappus racemosus subsp.</p>
<p>pinetorum, commonly known as the pinebrush horseweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure and is often found in dry, open habitats such as sandy soils and pine forests.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a raceme, which are followed by bristly, pale褐色 pappus structures that aid in wind dispersal. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to thrive in harsh, semi-arid conditions, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystem.</p>
