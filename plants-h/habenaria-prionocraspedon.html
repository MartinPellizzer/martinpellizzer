                    <h1>Habenaria prionocraspedon</h1>
<p>Habenaria prionocraspedon, commonly known as the narrow-lobed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a loose raceme, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and its role in the orchid family's evolutionary diversity.</p>
