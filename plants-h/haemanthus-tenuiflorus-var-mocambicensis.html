                    <h1>Haemanthus tenuiflorus var. mocambicensis</h1>
<p>Haemanthus tenuiflorus var. mocambicensis, commonly known as the coastal haemanthus, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in coastal areas of Mozambique.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit and produces striking, upright inflorescences with white to pale pink flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its arid coastal environment. It is typically found in sandy soils near the shoreline, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
