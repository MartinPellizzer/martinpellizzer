<p>Hymenophyllum refrondescens, commonly known as the silver moss, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a membranous covering.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum refrondescens is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic.</p>
