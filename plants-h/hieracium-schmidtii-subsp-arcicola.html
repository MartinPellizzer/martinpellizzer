<p>Hieracium schmidtii subsp.</p>
<p>arcicola, commonly known as the Arctic hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in open, rocky or sandy habitats, often in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>The plant features a low-growing rosette of lanceolate leaves and produces yellow flowers in early summer. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in cold, harsh climates.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and has a circumpolar distribution.</p>
