                    <h1>Hymenophyllum attenuatum</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum attenuatum, commonly known as the slender filmy fern, is a delicate, epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features small, translucent, and often hairy fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant's rhizomes are short and often covered in a layer of fine, silky hairs. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This species thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in moist forests.</p>
