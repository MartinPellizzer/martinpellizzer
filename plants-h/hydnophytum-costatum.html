                    <h1>Hydnophytum costatum</h1>
<p>Hydnophytum costatum, commonly known as the pitcher plant or Venus's flytrap, is a unique carnivorous plant native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized leaf structures called pitchers, which are modified leaves designed to trap and digest insects. The inner surface of the pitcher is lined with a slippery wax coating that prevents prey from escaping. The plant also has nectar-producing glands that attract insects, and its roots form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>
<p>This plant plays an important ecological role in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its nutrient intake through carnivory.</p>
