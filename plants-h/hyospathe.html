<p>Hyospathe, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a tropical aquatic plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture, aiding in its buoyancy in water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or yellow in color. Hyospathe thrives in shallow, still waters and is often used in water gardens.</p>
<p>Its botanical name, *Hyospathe arborescens*, reflects its tree-like growth habit when cultivated in suitable conditions.</p>
