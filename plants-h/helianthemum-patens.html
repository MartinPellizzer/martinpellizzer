<p>Helianthemum patens, commonly known as the creeping sunflower, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. It typically spreads via stolons, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Helianthemum patens is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
