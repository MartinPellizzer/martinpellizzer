<p>Hedyotis viscida, commonly known as the sticky hedyotis, is a flowering plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing herb with slender, often hairy stems that produce small, white or greenish flowers. The plant's leaves are typically opposite and oval-shaped, with a slightly serrated edge. Hedyotis viscida thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its sticky secretions on the stems and leaves may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
