<p>Hemolepis canescens, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap aquatic prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, still water bodies and has thin, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface. Its flowers are small and usually white or pink, with a distinctive bilabiate structure.</p>
<p>Hemolepis canescens is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured prey.</p>
