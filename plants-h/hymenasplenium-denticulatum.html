<p>Hymenasplenium denticulatum, commonly known as the toothed spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive appearance with leafy, moss-like structures that form dense, carpet-like mats. The leaves are typically narrow, with a serrated or toothed margin, contributing to its common name. It reproduces through spores, which are released from tiny, stalked capsules located on the stems.</p>
<p>This plant is often found growing on rocks, soil, or decaying wood in temperate regions.</p>
