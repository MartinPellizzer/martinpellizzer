                    <h1>Hydrocotyle acutifolia</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle acutifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water pennywort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and marshes. The plant has finely divided, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, giving it a delicate appearance. Its small, white flowers bloom in early summer, and it produces small, round fruits that disperse by water.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle acutifolia plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through oxygenation.</p>
