<p>Haworthia cooperi var. pilifera, commonly known as the curly haworthia, is a compact, rosette-forming succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features pale green, fleshy leaves with distinctive white to yellowish tubercles and tufts of fine, white hairs along the edges. The plant produces tall, slender stems with small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the growing season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
