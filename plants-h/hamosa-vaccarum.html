<p>Hamosa vaccarum, commonly known as the coastal bluemink, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shorelines. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-gray hue that helps it reflect sunlight and retain moisture.</p>
<p>Hamosa vaccarum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dune soils and supporting coastal biodiversity.</p>
