<p>Hieracium transiens subsp.</p>
<p>asterocymum, commonly known as the variable hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and flowering heads composed of yellow disk flowers surrounded by ray florets.</p>
<p>The plant typically has basal and cauline leaves that are rough and hairy, with a distinctive lobed or toothed margin. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its variability in morphology, it is often challenging to distinguish from other hawkweed species without detailed botanical analysis.</p>
