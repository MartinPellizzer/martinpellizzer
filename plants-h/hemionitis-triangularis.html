                    <h1>Hemionitis triangularis</h1>
<p>Hemionitis triangularis, commonly known as the triangle fern, is a small, delicate fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of triangular, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in a distinctive linear pattern. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its unique leaf shape and compact growth make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and rock gardens.</p>
