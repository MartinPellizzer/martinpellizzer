                    <h1>Hydnophytum ellipticum</h1>
<p>Hydnophytum ellipticum, commonly known as the elliptic mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria, while also performing photosynthesis. It is native to Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
