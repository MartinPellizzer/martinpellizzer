<p>Haplophyton cimicidum, commonly known as the common liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a thalloid liverwort, meaning it has a flat, leaf-like structure rather than true leaves or roots. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures include both male and female gametophytes, which produce sperm and eggs respectively.</p>
<p>Haplophyton cimicidum plays an important role in soil stabilization and as a pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
