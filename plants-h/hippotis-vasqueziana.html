<p>Hippotis vasqueziana, commonly known as the Vasquez's bladderwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as lakes and ponds. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its stems may extend into the water column.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species with limited distribution.</p>
