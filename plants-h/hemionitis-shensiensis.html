<p>Hemionitis shensiensis, commonly known as the Sichuan hemionitis, is a rare and endemic fern species native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hemionitidaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fan-shaped fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories at high elevations. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
