                    <h1>Himantoglossum hircinum var. pullum</h1>
<p>Himantoglossum hircinum var. pullum, commonly known as the Scottish twayblade, is a rare orchid species native to the Scottish Highlands.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant with a distinctive leafless stem and a single, showy violet-blue flower. The plant thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is typically found in heathland and moorland habitats. It has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
