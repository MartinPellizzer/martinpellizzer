<p>Heteropolygonatum wugongshanensis, commonly known as the Wugongshan clubmoss, is a rare and endemic species of the family Huperjiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a creeping rhizome with alternating whorls of leaves. The plant exhibits a distinct heteromorphic structure, with some leaves being lanceolate and others ovate, contributing to its classification. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically in mountainous regions with cool climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
