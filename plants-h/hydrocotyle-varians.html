                    <h1>Hydrocotyle varians</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle varians, commonly known as the marsh mallow or water shield, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas.</p>
<p>It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often floating on the water surface, with roots submerged in the mud. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their mild sedative properties.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle varians plays an important role in maintaining water quality by filtering pollutants and providing habitat for aquatic life.</p>
