<p>Hymenophyllum seselifolium, commonly known as the silky haircap moss, is a small, epiphytic moss belonging to the family Hypnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, hair-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky coating. This plant typically grows on tree trunks and rocks in shaded, moist environments, particularly in temperate regions. Its spores are released from small, cup-shaped structures called calyptras, which are positioned at the tips of the leaves.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum seselifolium plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
