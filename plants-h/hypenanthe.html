                    <h1>Hypenanthe</h1>
<p>Hypenanthe, commonly known as the perianth, refers to the collective term for the floral parts that surround the reproductive organs of a flower.</p>
<p>In some species, the hypenanthe may consist of separate sepals and petals, while in others, these parts are fused into a single structure. It plays a crucial role in attracting pollinators and protecting the flower's reproductive structures. The hypenanthe can vary in color, shape, and size depending on the plant species.</p>
<p>Its structure is often adapted to the specific pollination strategies of the plant.</p>
