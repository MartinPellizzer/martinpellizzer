<p>Hansteinia jamesonii, commonly known as the Jameson's hansteinia, is a rare and striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact rosette of dark green, waxy leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant produces strikingly colorful, showy inflorescences that range from red to orange, often with yellow or green bracts. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat needs, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts.</p>
