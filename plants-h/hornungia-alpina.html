                    <h1>Hornungia alpina</h1>
<p>Hornungia alpina, commonly known as the alpine hornungia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense cushions or mats, which help it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a thick layer of fine hairs, providing insulation against freezing temperatures. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems.</p>
<p>Hornungia alpina is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can thrive in areas with strong winds and short growing seasons.</p>
