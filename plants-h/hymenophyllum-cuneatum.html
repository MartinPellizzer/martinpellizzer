                    <h1>Hymenophyllum cuneatum</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum cuneatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spore moss, is a small, delicate fern that belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often curled or rolled, and it typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are borne on the underside of the leaves and are clustered in small, cup-like formations called hymenophores.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum cuneatum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in high humidity and cool temperatures.</p>
