                    <h1>Heliophila acuminata</h1>
<p>Heliophila acuminata, commonly known as narrowleaf waterplantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, typically floating or semi-submerged, adapting to aquatic conditions.</p>
<p>Heliophila acuminata is valued for its role in wetland ecosystems and is sometimes used in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from water.</p>
