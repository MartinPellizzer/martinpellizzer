<p>Hydrocotyle hirsuta var. leptostachys, commonly known as the hairy water shield, is a perennial aquatic plant characterized by its floating leaves that are hairy and heart-shaped.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, which are arranged in a cluster at the end of slender stems. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil, contributing to water quality by filtering sediments.</p>
<p>The species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and ability to thrive in diverse aquatic environments.</p>
