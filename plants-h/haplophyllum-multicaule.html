<p>Haplophyllum multicaule, commonly known as the clustered haplophyllum, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Polygonaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and slender, branched stems that bear small, greenish-white flowers. Native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, it has adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils. The plant's simple, alternate leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Its flowers are typically clustered in inflorescences and bloom during the warmer months.</p>
