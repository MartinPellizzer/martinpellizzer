<p>Heracleum rawianum, commonly known as the Rawian giant hogweed, is a tall, herbaceous plant native to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It features large, umbrella-shaped compound leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in late summer, which are followed by spherical, hairy fruits. Its stems are thick, hollow, and covered with coarse hairs, often with purple spots.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
