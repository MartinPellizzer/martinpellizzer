                    <h1>Herniaria fontanesii var. gracilis</h1>
<p>Herniaria fontanesii var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and sandy soils in the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, greenish-gray leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, erect stems. It is well adapted to coastal and limestone habitats, thriving in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a hardy, ornamental plant suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
