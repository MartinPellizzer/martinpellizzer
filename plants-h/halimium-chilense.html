                    <h1>Halimium chilense</h1>
<p>Halimium chilense, commonly known as the Chilean sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Chile.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in sandy and coastal soils, often found in dune environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Halimium chilense is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes.</p>
