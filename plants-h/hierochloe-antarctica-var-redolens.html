                    <h1>Hierochloe antarctica var. redolens</h1>
<p>Hierochloe antarctica var. redolens, commonly known as the Antarctic hairgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to the cold climates of the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silky leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. This plant is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including strong winds and low temperatures. It thrives in high-altitude regions and is often found in alpine or subantarctic environments.</p>
<p>Its presence is an indicator of stable, nutrient-poor ecosystems in these extreme habitats.</p>
