                    <h1>Hariota cereiformis</h1>
<p>Hariota cereiformis, commonly known as the candlewood tree, is a unique species native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, columnar growth habit, which gives it a candle-like appearance, hence its common name. The plant has a thick, woody trunk with a fibrous, bark-like covering that helps it withstand harsh coastal conditions. Its leaves are small, leathery, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the branches.</p>
<p>Hariota cereiformis is adapted to sandy soils and salt spray, making it a resilient plant in its natural habitat.</p>
