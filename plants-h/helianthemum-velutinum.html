                    <h1>Helianthemum velutinum</h1>
<p>Helianthemum velutinum, commonly known as the woolly rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its fuzzy, silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves and compact growth habit make it well adapted to rocky or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Helianthemum velutinum is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
