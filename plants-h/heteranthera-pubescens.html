                    <h1>Heteranthera pubescens</h1>
<p>Heteranthera pubescens, commonly known as the hairy leaved water hyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It features oval, hairy leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often floating on the water surface. Its roots are submerged, absorbing nutrients from the water, which can affect aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Heteranthera pubescens is often found in slow-moving or still freshwater habitats.</p>
