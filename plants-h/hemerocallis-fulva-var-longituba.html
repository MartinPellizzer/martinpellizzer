                    <h1>Hemerocallis fulva var. longituba</h1>
<p>Hemerocallis fulva var. longituba, commonly known as the yellow daylily, is a variant of the daylily species native to Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is a perennial herb with rhizomatous roots, and it produces sword-shaped, grass-like leaves. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>The flowers are short-lived, typically lasting only one day, which is a common trait among daylilies.</p>
