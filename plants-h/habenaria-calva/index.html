                            <h1>Habenaria Calva</h1>
<p>Habenaria orchid, scientifically known as Habenaria calva, is a rare and delicate member of the orchid family native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. This small, terrestrial orchid is characterized by its slender stems and pale greenish-white flowers with a distinctive yellow lip. Despite its beauty, it is often overlooked due to its modest appearance and limited distribution. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this endangered species from habitat loss and environmental degradation.</p>
