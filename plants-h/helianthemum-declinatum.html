                    <h1>Helianthemum declinatum</h1>
<p>Helianthemum declinatum, commonly known as the creeping sandmat, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are typically clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
