                    <h1>Hanguana rubinea</h1>
<p>Hanguana rubinea, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red pneumatophores, which are specialized roots that extend above the water to facilitate gas exchange. The plant thrives in brackish water environments, often forming dense forests in tidal zones. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Hanguana rubinea plays a vital role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
