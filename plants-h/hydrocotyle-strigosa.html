                    <h1>Hydrocotyle strigosa</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle strigosa, commonly known as the silverleaf marsh plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in the Americas.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of broad, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread across muddy or wet soils, making it a common sight in marshes and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle strigosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic life.</p>
