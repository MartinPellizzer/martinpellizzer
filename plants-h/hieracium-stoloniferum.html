                    <h1>Hieracium stoloniferum</h1>
<p>Hieracium stoloniferum, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping growth habit, with stolons that root at the nodes and form dense mats. The plant produces yellow flowers that are typically arranged in clusters, and its leaves are broadly lance-shaped with serrated edges. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive spreading nature, it can become invasive in certain regions.</p>
