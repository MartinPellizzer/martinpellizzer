<p>Hoya hypolasia, commonly known as the hanging wax plant, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems that allow it to cling to surfaces as it grows. The plant produces clusters of waxy, star-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white in color. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Hoya hypolasia thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
