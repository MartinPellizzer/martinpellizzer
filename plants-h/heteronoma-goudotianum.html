                    <h1>Heteronoma goudotianum</h1>
<p>Heteronoma goudotianum, commonly known as the Goudot's heteronoma, is a rare and little-studied plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its botanical features suggest adaptations to humid, shaded environments, likely contributing to its restricted distribution.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited research, the conservation status of this species remains uncertain.</p>
