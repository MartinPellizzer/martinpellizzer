<p>Hedyotis beddomei, commonly known as the beddome's dot moss, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Hedyotis beddomei is considered vulnerable and is of interest for conservation efforts.</p>
