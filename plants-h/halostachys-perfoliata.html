                    <h1>Halostachys perfoliata</h1>
<p>Halostachys perfoliata, commonly known as the leafy spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and its clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions and is often found in disturbed soils. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
<p>The plant's distinctive feature is its leaves, which are often perforated by the stems, giving it the common name "perfoliata.".</p>
