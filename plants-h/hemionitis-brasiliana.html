<p>Hemionitis brasiliana, commonly known as the Brazilian hemionitis, is a rare and distinctive fern native to the Atlantic rainforests of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected natural reserves.</p>
