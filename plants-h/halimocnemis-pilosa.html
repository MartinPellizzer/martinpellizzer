                    <h1>Halimocnemis pilosa</h1>
<p>Halimocnemis pilosa, commonly known as the hairy sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branched stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating to further conserve moisture.</p>
<p>Halimocnemis pilosa is well adapted to sandy and gravelly soils, making it a common sight in desert and semi-desert regions.</p>
