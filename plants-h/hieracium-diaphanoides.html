<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, yellowish to greenish flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often arid habitats. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open areas.</p>
