<p>Hypolepis nigrescens, commonly known as the black fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that often develop a reddish or blackish hue when mature. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are relatively short and often produce multiple fronds from a single point.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
