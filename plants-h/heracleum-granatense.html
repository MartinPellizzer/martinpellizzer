<p>Heracleum granatense, commonly known as the granate hogweed, is a tall perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its large, umbrella-shaped umbels of white or greenish-white flowers. The plant has hollow, ridged stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are large, pinnately divided, and have a distinctive, somewhat foul odor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and along streambanks.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
