<p>It is a member of the Alismataceae family and is characterized by its dense, ribbon-like leaves that form extensive underwater meadows. This species thrives in sandy or muddy substrates and plays a vital role in stabilizing sediment and providing habitat for marine life. Halophila capricorni is adapted to brackish and saline environments, making it an important component of seagrass ecosystems in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its flowering structures are small and inconspicuous, typically producing tiny, greenish flowers that are pollinated by water currents.</p>
