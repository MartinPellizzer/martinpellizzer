<p>Holmgrenanthe petrophila, commonly known as the rockholmgrenanthe, is a rare and specialized plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit and features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, humid climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Holmgrenanthe petrophila is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
