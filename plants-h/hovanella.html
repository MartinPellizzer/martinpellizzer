                    <h1>Hovanella</h1>
<p>Hovanella, commonly known as the Christmas star, is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, compact form and vibrant, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant produces small, dark blue or black berries that are edible and often used in culinary applications. Hovanella thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland landscapes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to provide color during the typically dull winter months.</p>
