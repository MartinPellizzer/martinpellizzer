<p>Hydrocotyle vulgaris subsp.</p>
<p>pleiantha, commonly known as marsh pennywort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and aquatic environments. It features heart-shaped, floating or submerged leaves that are typically smooth and bright green.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, often floating on the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can influence local aquatic ecosystems.</p>
