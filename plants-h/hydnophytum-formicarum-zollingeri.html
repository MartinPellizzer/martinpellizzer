                    <h1>Hydnophytum formicarum zollingeri</h1>
<p>Hydnophytum formicarum zollingeri, commonly known as the ant plant, is a hemiparasitic plant that forms a symbiotic relationship with ants.</p>
<p>It produces specialized structures called domatia, which serve as shelter for ant colonies. The plant obtains nutrients through its roots from the host plant while also relying on ants for protection from herbivores. The ants, in turn, receive food from the nectar produced by the plant's flowers.</p>
<p>This unique interaction highlights the complex ecological relationships in tropical ecosystems.</p>
