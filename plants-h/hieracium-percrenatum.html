                    <h1>Hieracium percrenatum</h1>
<p>Hieracium percrenatum, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can form dense mats due to its spreading rhizomes. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by the development of bristly, oval-shaped seeds.</p>
<p>Hieracium percrenatum is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit.</p>
