                            <h1>Helmia Tomentosa</h1>
<p>Helmia tomentosa, scientifically known as Helmia tomentosa, is a small, herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is commonly referred to as the woolly helmet or woolly helminth. This species is characterized by its dense, hairy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early summer. It often grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Despite its modest appearance, Helmia tomentosa plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
