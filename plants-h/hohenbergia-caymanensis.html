                    <h1>Hohenbergia caymanensis</h1>
<p>Hohenbergia caymanensis, commonly known as the Cayman Islands hohenbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Cayman Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, a common adaptation in its humid, tropical environment. The plant produces inflorescences with bright red bracts that contrast sharply with its dark green foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Hohenbergia caymanensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardens.</p>
