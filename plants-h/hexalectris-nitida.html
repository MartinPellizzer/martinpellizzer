<p>Hexalectris nitida, commonly known as the slender pogonia, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid with a unique morphology, featuring a slender, often leafless stem and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in acidic, moist habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. Its life cycle is closely tied to specific mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
