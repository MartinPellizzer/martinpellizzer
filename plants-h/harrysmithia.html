<p>It consists of several species, most of which are characterized by their tall, spire-like inflorescences and showy, often fragrant flowers. The plants typically have narrow, strap-shaped leaves and are adapted to survive in hot, dry environments. Harrysmithia species are often used in xeriscaping due to their low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
