                    <h1>Haworthia arachnoidea var. tenera</h1>
<p>Haworthia arachnoidea var. tenera, commonly known as the woolly Haworthia, is a compact, succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a dense rosette of fleshy, bluish-green leaves covered in fine, white tubercles that give it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers on tall, slender stalks during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
