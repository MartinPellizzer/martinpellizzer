<p>Hemerocallis rutilans, commonly known as the golden daylily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features strap-like, grass-like leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange. The flowers are typically borne in clusters on tall, branching stems and bloom for a short period each day, hence the name "daylily.".
