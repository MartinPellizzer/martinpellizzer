<p>Hieracium amplexicaule subsp.</p>
<p>oleaginicolor, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, hairy leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in dense clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native plant species and is sometimes considered a weed.</p>
