<p>Heteropogon arrhenobasis, commonly known as the male grass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and wetlands, and is often found in association with other wetland vegetation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
