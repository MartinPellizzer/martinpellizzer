<p>Hemianemia heterodoxa, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and unusual plant with distinctive botanical features.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its unique, asymmetrical fronds that give it a ghost-like appearance. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in a distinctive pattern.
