                    <h1>Huberantha senjiana</h1>
<p>Huberantha senjiana, commonly known as the Senja orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in the mountainous areas of Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Huberantha senjiana is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
