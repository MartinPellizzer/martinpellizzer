                    <h1>Habenaria ciliaris var. holopetala</h1>
<p>Habenaria ciliaris var. holopetala, commonly known as the broad-leaved marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetlands and marshy areas in eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces showy, pale green to yellowish flowers with prominent, recurved petals. The plant is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which consists of several clustered flowers on a single stem. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of undisturbed wetland ecosystems.</p>
