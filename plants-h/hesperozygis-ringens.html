<p>Hesperozygis ringens, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Convolvulaceae family, characterized by its climbing habit and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces vibrant blue or purple blooms that open in the early morning and close by midday, adapting to the harsh desert environment. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Hesperozygis ringens is also notable for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
