                    <h1>Humboltia saltatoria</h1>
<p>Humboltia saltatoria, commonly known as the saltbush, is a shrub native to coastal regions of the western United States and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is adapted to saline and arid environments, with small, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it resilient in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Humboltia saltatoria plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
