                    <h1>Hieracium verbenacum</h1>
<p>Hieracium verbenacum, commonly known as field hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and meadows, and can form dense mats due to its spreading growth habit. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow with a central disk.</p>
<p>It is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators in its native habitats.</p>
