                    <h1>Hesperis villosa</h1>
<p>Hesperis villosa, commonly known as the hairy bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, often found in alpine meadows and dry grasslands. Its hairy stems and leaves are adaptations to its arid and high-altitude environment, helping to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Hesperis villosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, fragrant blooms.</p>
