<p>Habranthus calderensis, commonly known as the Calder Mountain bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue to purple bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, seed-filled capsules after flowering.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
