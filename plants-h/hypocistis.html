<p>Hypocistis, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Melanthiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their perennial growth habit and their ability to thrive in woodland environments. The leaves are typically basal, forming a rosette, and are often lance-shaped with a waxy texture. Hypocistis species produce small, greenish flowers that are clustered in umbels, and they are known for their toxic properties.</p>
