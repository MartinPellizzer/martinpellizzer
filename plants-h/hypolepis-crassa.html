                    <h1>Hypolepis crassa</h1>
<p>Hypolepis crassa, commonly known as the broad-leaf huperzia, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, evergreen fronds that are typically broad and leathery in texture. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns.</p>
<p>Hypolepis crassa is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments.</p>
