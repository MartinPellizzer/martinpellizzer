                    <h1>Hippion dichotomum</h1>
<p>Hippion dichotomum, commonly known as the two-branched plant, is a rare and unique species characterized by its distinctive dichotomous branching pattern.</p>
<p>It is a small shrub with slender, woody stems that split into two equal branches at each node. The leaves are typically small, oval-shaped, and arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in specific, often remote, habitats with well-drained soil and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized growth requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
