                    <h1>Haplopappus bezanillanus</h1>
<p>Haplopappus bezanillanus, commonly known as the desert pappus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and cylindrical, hairy stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, followed by feathery pappus structures that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it plays a role in stabilizing desert ecosystems and providing habitat for small insects.</p>
