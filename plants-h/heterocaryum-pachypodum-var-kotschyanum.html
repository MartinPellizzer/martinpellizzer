<p>Heterocaryum pachypodum var. kotschyanum, commonly known as the Kotschyan's bottle tree, is a striking member of the Bignoniaceae family native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, swollen trunk that stores water, a feature adapted to its harsh, dry environment. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. Its leaves are opposite and often deciduous, reducing water loss during droughts.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soils in semi-arid landscapes.</p>
