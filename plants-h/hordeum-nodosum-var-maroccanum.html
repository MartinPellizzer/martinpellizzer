                    <h1>Hordeum nodosum var. maroccanum</h1>
<p>Hordeum nodosum var. maroccanum, commonly known as Moroccan nodose barley, is a variant of the nodose barley species native to North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive nodules on the stem, which are a result of fungal symbiosis, primarily with the endophytic fungus Neotyphodium coenophialum. This plant is typically found in arid and semi-arid environments, where it thrives due to its drought-resistant properties. The grains are small and hard, often used in traditional local cuisines and as forage for livestock.</p>
<p>Its ecological significance lies in its role in supporting beneficial fungi and its adaptation to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
