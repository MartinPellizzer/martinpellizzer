<p>Hymenophyllum bibraianum, commonly known as the New Zealand spore moss, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks in humid forests. Its sporangia are clustered in small, cup-like structures called soruses, which are usually located on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum bibraianum is known for its unique morphology and is often found in the understory of temperate rainforests.</p>
