<p>Hieracium recurvum, commonly known as the bentleaf hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the daisy family. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a rough texture, often with a reddish or purplish underside.</p>
<p>Hieracium recurvum is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, where it can become invasive in certain ecosystems.</p>
