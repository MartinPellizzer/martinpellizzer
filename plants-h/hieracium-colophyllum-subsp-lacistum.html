<p>Hieracium colophyllum subsp.</p>
<p>lacistum, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it forms dense, low-growing mats.</p>
<p>The plant has bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat preferences, it is often found in mountainous environments with limited soil depth and harsh climatic conditions.</p>
