                            <h1>Hieracium Maculatum Var. Spilophaeum</h1>
<p>Hieracium maculatum var. spilophaeum is a lesser-known member of the dandelion family known for its distinctive appearance and ecological significance. This variant is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats across Europe and parts of Asia. Its leaves are typically lobed and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers bloom in a striking yellow color. The plant plays an important role in supporting pollinators and maintaining soil stability. Despite its modest size, it holds value in both botanical study and natural landscapes.</p>
