<p>Hydrobryum micrantherum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed water moss, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Hydrobryaceae.</p>
<p>It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. The plant has finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged, aiding in its ability to absorb nutrients from the water. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters near the water's surface.</p>
<p>Hydrobryum micrantherum plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering sediments and supporting aquatic ecosystems.</p>
