                    <h1>Hordeum pusillum</h1>
<p>Hordeum pusillum, commonly known as dwarf barley, is a small annual grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of about 10â€“30 cm and has slender, cylindrical stems with narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both sterile and fertile florets. Its seeds are enclosed in tough, straw-like glumes, which aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Hordeum pusillum is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
