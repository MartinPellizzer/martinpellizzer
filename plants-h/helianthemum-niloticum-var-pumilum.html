                    <h1>Helianthemum niloticum var. pumilum</h1>
<p>Helianthemum niloticum var. pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf African sunflower, is a low-growing, succulent shrub native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its compact form and drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for xeriscaping and coastal gardens.</p>
