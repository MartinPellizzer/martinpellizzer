                    <h1>Huperzia × protoporophila</h1>
<p>Huperzia × protoporophila, commonly known as the hybrid huperzia, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae.</p>
<p>It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Huperzia squamosa and Huperzia phlegmaria, two species native to the eastern United States. The plant typically grows as a low, creeping mat with small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors, and is often found in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on hybridization and plant morphology.</p>
