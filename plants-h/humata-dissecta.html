<p>Humata dissecta, commonly known as the dissected fern, is a species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are finely divided, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The leaves are often a deep green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to tropical gardens.</p>
