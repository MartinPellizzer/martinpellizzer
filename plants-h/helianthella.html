<p>Helianthella, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to North America and are often found in alpine and rocky habitats. They typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The flowers are yellow and resemble dandelions, with ray florets surrounding a central disk.</p>
<p>Helianthella species are generally short-lived perennial herbs that play a role in stabilizing soil in their native environments.</p>
