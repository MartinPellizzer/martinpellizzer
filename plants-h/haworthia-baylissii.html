                    <h1>Haworthia baylissii</h1>
<p>Haworthia baylissii, commonly known as the Bayliss's Haworthia, is a small, compact succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically green with white or silver markings, which help it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections.</p>
