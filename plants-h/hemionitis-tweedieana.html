                    <h1>Hemionitis tweedieana</h1>
<p>Hemionitis tweedieana, commonly known as the Tweedie's hemionitis, is a rare and unique fern native to the mountainous regions of central China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in shaded, rocky habitats. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemionitis tweedieana is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
