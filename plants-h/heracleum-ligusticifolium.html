                    <h1>Heracleum ligusticifolium</h1>
<p>Heracleum ligusticifolium, commonly known as cow parsnip, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features a stout, hollow stem that is often covered with fine hairs, and its large, umbrella-like compound leaves are deeply lobed with a distinctive, aromatic odor. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in a compound umbel, which are pollinated by insects. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, stream banks, and in forest clearings.</p>
<p>Due to its similar appearance to poison hemlock, it can be mistaken for toxic species, so caution is advised when identifying it.</p>
