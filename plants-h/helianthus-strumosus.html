<p>Helianthus strumosus, commonly known as the prairie sunflower, is a flowering plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow petals and a dark brown central disk, typical of the Asteraceae family. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. It produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across grassland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Helianthus strumosus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
