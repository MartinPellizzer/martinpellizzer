<p>Hesperis desertorum, commonly known as the desert candytuft, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in drought conditions. Its leaves are basal, narrow, and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Hesperis desertorum is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
