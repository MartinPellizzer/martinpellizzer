                    <h1>Hydrocotyle tripartita</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle tripartita, commonly known as the three-part water arum, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments in the Americas.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically floating or submerged, with a distinctive tripartite division. The plant produces small, white, spadix-like flowers that are surrounded by a hooded spathe, characteristic of the Araceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle tripartita is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality.</p>
