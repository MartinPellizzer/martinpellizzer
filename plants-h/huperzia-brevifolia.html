                    <h1>Huperzia brevifolia</h1>
<p>Huperzia brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved clubmoss, is a species of evergreen fern ally native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and small, linear leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces sporangia in cone-like structures called strobila, which are typically found at the base of the leaves. Huperzia brevifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or in forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important component of its native ecosystems.</p>
