<p>Hesperonia heimerlii, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Convolvulaceae family, characterized by its trumpet-shaped flowers and climbing or trailing growth habit. The plant produces vibrant blue to purple flowers that bloom in the early morning, adapting to the harsh desert environment. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Hesperonia heimerlii is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
