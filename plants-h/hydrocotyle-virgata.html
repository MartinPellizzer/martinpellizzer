                    <h1>Hydrocotyle virgata</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle virgata, commonly known as the water pennywort, is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often forming dense mats near the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has rounded, waxy leaves that are usually less than 1 inch in diameter, with a distinct central vein. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbels, blooming in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle virgata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
