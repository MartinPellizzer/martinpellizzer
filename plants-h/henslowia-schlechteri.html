<p>Henslowia schlechteri, commonly known as the Schlechter's henslowia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves with a glossy surface and produces small, greenish-white flowers during the spring. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection.</p>
