<p>Hieracium glaucum var. reichardtii, commonly known as Reichardt's hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The flowers are yellow, with a central disk surrounded by ray florets, and the plant produces seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
