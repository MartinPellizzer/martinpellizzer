<p>Hieracium oroglaucum subsp.</p>
<p>stenoglossophyllum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing stature and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh mountainous habitats.</p>
