<p>Hyptis pulegioides, commonly known as catnip, is a perennial herb native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic plants such as mint and basil. The plant is characterized by its serrated leaves and clusters of small, pale blue or white flowers. It is known for its strong aromatic properties, largely due to the presence of nepetalactone, a compound that affects the behavior of cats.</p>
<p>Hyptis pulegioides is often used in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent.</p>
