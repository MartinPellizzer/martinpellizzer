                    <h1>Heteropterys pauciflora f. eglandulosa</h1>
<p>Heteropterys pauciflora f. eglandulosa, commonly known as the glandless heteropterys, is a rare variant of the species native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reduced number of flowers compared to the typical form, and its foliage lacks the glandular structures present in the standard variety. The plant belongs to the Malvaceae family and is known for its striking, velvety leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphological features, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
