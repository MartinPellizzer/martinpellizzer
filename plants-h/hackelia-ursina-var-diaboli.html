<p>Hackelia ursina var. diaboli, commonly known as the devil's paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red, brush-like inflorescences that resemble a paintbrush, hence its common name. The plant belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is known for its showy, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and meadows.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
