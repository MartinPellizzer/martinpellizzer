<p>Hieracium aquilonare, commonly known as the windgrass, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellow-orange flower heads and is typically found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. The plant has rough, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces achenes with pappus structures that aid in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Hieracium aquilonare is often considered a weed but plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for pollinators.</p>
