                    <h1>Haplosphaera himalayensis</h1>
<p>Haplosphaera himalayensis, commonly known as the Himalayan flat sponge, is a unique freshwater sponge found in the cold, mountainous regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the class Hexactinellida, characterized by its silica-based skeletal structure composed of intricate, needle-like spicules. The sponge's body is elongated and flattened, allowing it to adhere to rocky substrates in fast-flowing streams. Its filter-feeding mechanism involves capturing microscopic organisms from the water using specialized cells called choanocytes.</p>
<p>This species plays a vital role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing shelter for smaller aquatic life.</p>
