<p>Hedysarum rotundifolium, commonly known as the roundleaf peavine, is a perennial legume native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rounded, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of pink to purple pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and moist meadows.</p>
<p>Hedysarum rotundifolium plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobial bacteria.</p>
