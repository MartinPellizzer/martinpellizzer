                    <h1>Hieracium ferum</h1>
<p>Hieracium ferum, commonly known as common hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom from summer to autumn. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, often becoming invasive. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it is considered a weed in many environments.</p>
