                    <h1>Habenaria hyperborea</h1>
<p>Habenaria hyperborea, commonly known as the Arctic orchid, is a rare and cold-adapted species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in tundra or alpine habitats. Its survival depends on specific environmental conditions, including short growing seasons and low temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to climate change, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
