<p>Homalocephala texensis, commonly known as the Texas false nettle, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert and scrubland environments. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters. It is characterized by its unique, hollow stems that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Despite its common name, it is not related to true nettles and lacks the stinging hairs found on those plants.</p>
