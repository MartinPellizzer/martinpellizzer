                    <h1>Hydrocotyle domingensis</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle domingensis, commonly known as the Mexican water shield, is a floating aquatic plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It has small, rounded leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern on the water surface. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers with five petals, which bloom in the early morning. Its roots are anchored in the sediment at the bottom of water bodies, allowing it to spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle domingensis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and stabilizing water surfaces.</p>
