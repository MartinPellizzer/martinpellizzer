<p>Hedyotis caroliniana, commonly known as Carolina jewelweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, branching stems covered with small, translucent, yellow-orange flowers that bloom from summer to fall. The plant produces small, bead-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a waxy coating, and the plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>Hedyotis caroliniana is often found growing in clusters, and it plays a role in supporting local insect populations.</p>
