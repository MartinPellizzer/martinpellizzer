                    <h1>Haplopappus acradenius var. eremophilus</h1>
<p>Haplopappus acradenius var. eremophilus, commonly known as the desert hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure and gray-green foliage adapted to withstand harsh desert conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, daisy-like clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its narrow, linear leaves are covered in a fine layer of hairs, reducing water loss and enhancing drought tolerance.</p>
<p>This species is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in full sun and exhibiting a high degree of resilience to extreme environmental conditions.</p>
