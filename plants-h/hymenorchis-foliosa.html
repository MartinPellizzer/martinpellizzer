<p>Hymenorchis foliosa, commonly known as the leafy orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which are typically fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and wasps. Hymenorchis foliosa is epiphytic in some habitats but can also grow on soil, making it adaptable to various environments.</p>
<p>Its unique floral structure and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
