<p>It is a low-growing, perennial species that typically forms dense mats on dry, disturbed soils. The plant has slender, hairless stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny grains. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
