                    <h1>Hesperoseris</h1>
<p>Hesperoseris, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Hesperoseris species are typically herbaceous annuals or perennials, characterized by their yellow to orange flowers and hairy, often succulent leaves. They have adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through mechanisms such as deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area.</p>
<p>The genus is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing desert soils.</p>
