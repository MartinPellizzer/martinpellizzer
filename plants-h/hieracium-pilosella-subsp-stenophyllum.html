<p>Hieracium pilosella subsp.</p>
<p>stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow composite flowers in summer, arranged in a single head with many small florets. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ability to form dense colonies, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>
