                    <h1>Heterophyllium helveticum</h1>
<p>Heterophyllium helveticum, commonly known as the Swiss water fern, is a unique aquatic fern that exhibits heterophyllism, a phenomenon where its leaves change形态 depending on their environment.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant has a distinctive appearance, with submerged leaves being thread-like and floating leaves being broader and more robust. Its reproductive structures are borne on specialized fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Heterophyllium helveticum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water quality maintenance.</p>
