                    <h1>Haloragis depressa var. serpyllifolia</h1>
<p>Haloragis depressa var. serpyllifolia, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in compact clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand prolonged drought.</p>
