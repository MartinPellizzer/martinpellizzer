                    <h1>Hylocharis hispida</h1>
<p>Hylocharis hispida, commonly known as the hispid antshrike, is a small passerine bird native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Thamnophilidae, which includes antshrikes and related birds. The plant name is actually a misnomer, as Hylocharis hispida refers to a bird, not a plant. Therefore, there are no botanical aspects to discuss.</p>
<p>I can't reply.</p>
