<p>Hieracium pelagae, commonly known as the sea hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the North Atlantic.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and clusters of small, yellowish to brownish composite flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty, windy conditions.</p>
<p>Hieracium pelagae plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
