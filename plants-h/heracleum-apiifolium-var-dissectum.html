                    <h1>Heracleum apiifolium var. dissectum</h1>
<p>Heracleum apiifolium var. dissectum, commonly known as the fern-leaf cowparley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that resemble those of a fern.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, producing a delicate, white or pale green inflorescence that adds ornamental value to the landscape. The leaves are aromatic and contain compounds that can cause irritation upon contact, a common trait among members of the carrot family.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ecological value to pollinators.</p>
