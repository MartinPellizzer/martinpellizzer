                    <h1>Habenaria psycodes f. nivalis</h1>
<p>Habenaria psycodes f. nivalis, commonly known as the snow orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale, almost white flowers that resemble snowflakes, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments where it relies on specific microclimates for survival. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators like bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
