                    <h1>Hymenophyllum intercalatum</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum intercalatum, commonly known as the intercalated fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, grass-like fronds and is typically found growing on shaded, moist rock surfaces or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a unique structure with a thin, membranous layer covering its leaves, which helps it retain moisture in humid environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum intercalatum is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and is often found in rainforests.</p>
