                    <h1>Heterotheca graminifolia var. tracyi</h1>
<p>Heterotheca graminifolia var. tracyi, commonly known as Tracy's golden coneflower, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellow ray flowers and brown, cylindrical disk flowers, which are typical of the Asteraceae family. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and slight morphological differences from the typical form of H. graminifolia.</p>
