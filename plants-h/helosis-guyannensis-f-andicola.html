                    <h1>Helosis guyannensis f. andicola</h1>
<p>Helosis guyannensis f. andicola, commonly known as the Andean helosis, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring small, clustered leaves and a compact growth habit adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils typical of Andean cloud forests. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for specific ecological zones.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for ecological and conservation research.</p>
