<p>Hierochloe borealis subsp.</p>
<p>setifolia, commonly known as the Arctic feathergrass, is a low-growing grass species native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, silky hairs that give it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant typically forms dense mats or tufts, adapting to the harsh, cold environments it inhabits. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in short, stiff hairs, which help reduce water loss in extreme conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies plays a role in stabilizing soil in polar and high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
