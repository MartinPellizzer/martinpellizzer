<p>Hydrotriche bryoides, commonly known as the moss-like liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leaf-like structures called phyllidia, which are typically arranged in a dense, cushion-like growth form. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on soil surfaces or rock substrates. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short stalks and release spores when mature.</p>
<p>Hydrotriche bryoides plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates.</p>
