<p>Haplopteris doniana, commonly known as the African shield fern, is a tropical fern native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically leathery and dark green. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help in spreading and colonizing new areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are released into the air for dispersal.</p>
<p>Haplopteris doniana is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and along stream banks.</p>
