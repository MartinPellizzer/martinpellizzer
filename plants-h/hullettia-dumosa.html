                    <h1>Hullettia dumosa</h1>
<p>Hullettia dumosa, commonly known as the slender mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are typically white or pale green. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. Hullettia dumosa is native to parts of Africa and is adapted to thrive in tropical and subtropical environments.</p>
<p>Its parasitic nature allows it to draw nutrients and water from its host, which can sometimes weaken the host tree.</p>
