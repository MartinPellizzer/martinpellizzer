                    <h1>Hyperanthera</h1>
<p>Hyperanthera, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a single, tall flowering stem that bears a cluster of small, yellow flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers develop into fluffy, white seed heads similar to those of dandelions. Hyperanthera species are often found in dry, disturbed soils and are native to regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>These plants are generally short-lived and can be either annual or perennial depending on the species.</p>
