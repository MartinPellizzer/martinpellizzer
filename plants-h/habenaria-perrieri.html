<p>Habenaria perrieri, commonly known as the Perrier's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in summer. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually oval and arranged in a rosette pattern, and the flowers are often pale green or white with intricate patterns.</p>
<p>Habitat destruction and over-collection have made it a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
