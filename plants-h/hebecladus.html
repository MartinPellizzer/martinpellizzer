<p>Hebecladus, commonly known as the rock hebe, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Plantaginaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to New Zealand and are characterized by their compact growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers. Hebecladus species typically thrive in rocky or well-drained soils, often found in coastal or alpine environments. They produce small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
