                    <h1>Hemionitis keralensis</h1>
<p>Hemionitis keralensis, commonly known as Keralan hemionitis, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial herb belonging to the family Hemionitidaceae, characterized by its rosette-like growth habit. The plant features delicate, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its humid, shaded habitat. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, Hemionitis keralensis is under threat and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
