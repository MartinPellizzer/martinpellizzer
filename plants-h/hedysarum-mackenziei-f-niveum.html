                    <h1>Hedysarum mackenziei f. niveum</h1>
<p>Hedysarum mackenziei f. niveum, commonly known as the snow-flowered prickly poppy, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, giving it its common name. The plant has a robust, branched stem covered in stiff, spiny hairs, which help protect it from herbivores. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, ovate leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
