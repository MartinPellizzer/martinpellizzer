<p>Hieracium retyezatense subsp.</p>
<p>glaucosinuosifrons, commonly known as the glaucous-veined hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lanceolate leaves that are typically glaucous in appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a single, terminal capitulum, which is surrounded by leaf-like bracts. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
