                    <h1>Hieracium patzkei</h1>
<p>Hieracium patzkei, commonly known as the Patzke's hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high alpine regions of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, thriving in well-drained soils at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its yellow flowers bloom in late summer, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in several European countries.</p>
