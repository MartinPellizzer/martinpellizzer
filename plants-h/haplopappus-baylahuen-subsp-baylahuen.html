<p>Haplopappus baylahuen subsp.</p>
<p>baylahuen, commonly known as the Baylahuen dwarf dandelion, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to southern Chile. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, silvery-green leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, white pappus structures that aid in wind pollination. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the temperate climate of its native region.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range.</p>
