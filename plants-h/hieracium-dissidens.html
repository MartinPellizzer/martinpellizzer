<p>Hieracium dissidens, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it can form dense colonies due to its rhizomatous growth habit. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow with a distinctive central disc.</p>
<p>Hieracium dissidens is also known for its ability to spread rapidly, making it both a common weed and a subject of ecological study.</p>
