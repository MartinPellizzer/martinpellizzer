                    <h1>Hakea temulenta</h1>
<p>Hakea temulenta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces cylindrical, red or pink flower spikes that appear in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Hakea temulenta is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in native garden landscaping.</p>
