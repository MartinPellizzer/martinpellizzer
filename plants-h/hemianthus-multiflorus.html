<p>Hemianthus multiflorus, commonly known as the African fan plant, is a species of aquatic plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, carpet-like growth with narrow, ribbon-like leaves that form a lush, green undercarpet in freshwater habitats. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a delicate floral display to its aquatic environment. It is often used in water gardens and pond landscapes for its ornamental value and ability to oxygenate water.</p>
