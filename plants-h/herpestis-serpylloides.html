<p>Herpestis serpylloides, commonly known as the slender false nettle, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces and small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that release tiny seeds when mature.</p>
<p>It is often mistaken for true nettles due to its similar appearance but lacks the stinging hairs.</p>
