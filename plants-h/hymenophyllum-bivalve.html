                    <h1>Hymenophyllum bivalve</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum bivalve, commonly known as the bivalve fern, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its leaves and are covered by a protective layer known as a hymenium.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and ecological preferences make it an important species in studies of moisture-dependent plant communities.</p>
