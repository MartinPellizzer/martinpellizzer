<p>Haloscias scothicum monstr.</p>
<p>phyllomana, commonly known as the Scottish leaf moss, is a rare and unique species of liverwort found in specific alpine and coastal environments. It exhibits a creeping growth habit with dense, overlapping foliage that forms a mat-like structure.</p>
<p>The plant's leaves are small, ovate, and typically have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. It thrives in moist, shaded areas with high humidity and is often found in regions with cool, temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
