                    <h1>Henslowia pauciflora</h1>
<p>Henslowia pauciflora, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Henslowia pauciflora is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy species found in desert and coastal scrub habitats.</p>
