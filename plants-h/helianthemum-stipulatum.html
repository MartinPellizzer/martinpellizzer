<p>Helianthemum stipulatum, commonly known as the creeping sunflower or stonecrop, is a low-growing, evergreen perennial native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, compact foliage with small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a valuable addition to drought-tolerant landscapes.</p>
