                    <h1>Haworthia pentagona</h1>
<p>Haworthia pentagona, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a species of succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with distinct white or yellow markings. The leaves are arranged in a tight spiral and are covered with a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, white, star-shaped flowers on tall, slender stems during the warmer months.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
