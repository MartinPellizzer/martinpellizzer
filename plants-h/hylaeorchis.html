                    <h1>Hylaeorchis</h1>
<p>Hylaeorchis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves and its striking, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. This plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Hylaeorchis thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air moisture, often found in the canopy of old-growth forests.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
