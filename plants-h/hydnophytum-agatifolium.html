                    <h1>Hydnophytum agatifolium</h1>
<p>Hydnophytum agatifolium, commonly known as the cat's tail plant, is a climbing hemiparasitic plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its unique morphology, including a long, trailing stem and specialized structures called haustoria that attach to host plants. The plant lacks true leaves but has modified structures called phyllodes that perform photosynthesis. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth, where it relies on other plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological role and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
