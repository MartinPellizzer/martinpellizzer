<p>Hocquartia, commonly known as the white star orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, meaning it grows in clusters with each stem producing new growth from the base.
