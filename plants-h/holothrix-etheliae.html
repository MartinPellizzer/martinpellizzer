                    <h1>Holothrix etheliae</h1>
<p>Holothrix etheliae, commonly known as the Ethel's ghostplant, is a rare and delicate member of the Pteridophyta division.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fern-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate rainforests. Its reproductive structures are unique, featuring spore-producing capsules that release microscopic spores into the air.</p>
<p>Due to its limited geographic range and habitat specificity, Holothrix etheliae is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
