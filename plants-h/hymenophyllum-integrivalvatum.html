<p>Hymenophyllum integrivalvatum, commonly known as the broad-veined filmy fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds with closely spaced, overlapping laminae that give it a feathery appearance. The plant is epiphytic, growing on trees and rocks in humid, shaded environments, typically in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are thin and translucent, with a unique structure that allows for efficient water retention and gas exchange.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
