The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in forage systems due to its nutritional value.</p>
<p>Hedysarum pumilum is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
