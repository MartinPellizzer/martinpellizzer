                    <h1>Hohenbergia billbergioides</h1>
<p>Hohenbergia billbergioides, commonly known as the silver leaf hohenbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of broad, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with vibrant orange to red bracts, which are showy but not particularly fragrant. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings.</p>
