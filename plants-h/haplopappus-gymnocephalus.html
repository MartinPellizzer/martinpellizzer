                    <h1>Haplopappus gymnocephalus</h1>
<p>Haplopappus gymnocephalus, commonly known as the naked-headed pappus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and wind-dispersed seeds. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The small, yellowish flowers bloom in summer, followed by a fluffy pappus that aids in seed dispersal.</p>
