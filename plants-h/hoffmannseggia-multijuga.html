<p>Hoffmannseggia multijuga, commonly known as the desert holly, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
