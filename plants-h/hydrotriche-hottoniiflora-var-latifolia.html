                    <h1>Hydrotriche hottoniiflora var. latifolia</h1>
<p>Hydrotriche hottoniiflora var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf hydrotriche, is a rare and striking plant native to the Chihuahuan Desert of Texas and New Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine white coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise rugged appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is typically found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of desert ecosystem health.</p>
