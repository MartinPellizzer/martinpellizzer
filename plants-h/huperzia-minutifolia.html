                    <h1>Huperzia minutifolia</h1>
<p>Huperzia minutifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved clubmoss, is a species of fern ally native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its diminutive, scale-like leaves that form dense, compact clusters. The plant produces sporangia on specialized structures called strobili, which are typically found at the base of the leaf clusters. Huperzia minutifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
