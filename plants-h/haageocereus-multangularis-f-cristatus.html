                    <h1>Haageocereus multangularis f. cristatus</h1>
<p>Haageocereus multangularis f. cristatus, commonly known as the cristate cactus or the star cactus, is a unique variant of the species Haageocereus multangularis.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, flattened, and often star-shaped growth form, which results from the proliferation of areoles. This form is a natural mutation known as a "cristata" or "cristate" growth, leading to a bushy, branched appearance. The plant typically has a gray-green color with a slightly waxy texture, and it is native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
