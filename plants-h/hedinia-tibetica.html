                    <h1>Hedinia tibetica</h1>
<p>Hedinia tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan hedinia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, particularly in Tibet and Nepal.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Hedinia tibetica is adapted to cold, high-altitude conditions and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
