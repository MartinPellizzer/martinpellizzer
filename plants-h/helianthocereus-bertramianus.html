                    <h1>Helianthocereus bertramianus</h1>
<p>Helianthocereus bertramianus, commonly known as the Bertram's night bloomer, is a cactus species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a small, columnar cactus with ribbed stems and spines that provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its unique blooming pattern and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
