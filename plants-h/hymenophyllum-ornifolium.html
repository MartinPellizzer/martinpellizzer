<p>Hymenophyllum ornifolium, commonly known as the lace fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to humid tropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble lace, giving it its common name. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and habitat make it a distinctive member of the Hymenophyllaceae family.</p>
