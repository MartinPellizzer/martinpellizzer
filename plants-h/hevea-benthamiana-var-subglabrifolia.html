                    <h1>Hevea benthamiana var. subglabrifolia</h1>
<p>Hevea benthamiana var. subglabrifolia, commonly known as the smooth-leaved rubber tree, is a variant of the rubber tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves and is often used in scientific research due to its genetic similarity to the commercial rubber tree, Hevea brasiliensis. The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its ability to produce latex, which is a key component in natural rubber production.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important model organism in studies related to plant genetics and biotechnology.</p>
