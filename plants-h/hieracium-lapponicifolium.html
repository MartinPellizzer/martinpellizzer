                    <h1>Hieracium lapponicifolium</h1>
<p>Hieracium lapponicifolium, commonly known as the Lapland hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arctic and alpine regions of northern Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, rocky or sandy habitats, often in mountainous areas where the climate is cool and short-growing seasons prevail. The plant has basal leaves that are usually spoon-shaped or heart-shaped, and its yellow flowers are arranged in a flat-topped cluster. It is characterized by its fibrous root system and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its cold tolerance, it is an important component of tundra and alpine vegetation.</p>
