                    <h1>Hevea peruviana</h1>
<p>Hevea peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian rubber tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, alternate, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by woody capsules containing seeds. It is closely related to the rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis) and shares similar latex-producing properties.</p>
<p>However, it is less commonly cultivated for commercial rubber production compared to its relative.</p>
