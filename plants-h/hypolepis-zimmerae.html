<p>Hypolepis zimmerae, commonly known as the Zimmer's sword fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or in rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Hypolepis zimmerae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses.</p>
