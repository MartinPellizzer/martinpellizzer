                    <h1>Haloragis masatierrana var. applanata</h1>
<p>Haloragis masatierrana var. applanata, commonly known as the flat-leaved waterwheel plant, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive whorled arrangement of narrow, flat leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water's surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, typically emerging from the water, which attract various pollinators. It thrives in brackish or freshwater environments, often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its adaptability to fluctuating water levels and salinity, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
