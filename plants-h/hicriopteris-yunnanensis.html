                    <h1>Hicriopteris yunnanensis</h1>
<p>Hicriopteris yunnanensis, commonly known as Yunnan water fern, is a rare species of aquatic fern native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pellaeaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can receive adequate sunlight. Its spores are released into the water, allowing for propagation in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
