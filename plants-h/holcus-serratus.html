                    <h1>Holcus serratus</h1>
<p>Holcus serratus, commonly known as the serrated bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, creeping stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with serrated edges, which give it its common name. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, and it blooms from late spring to early autumn.</p>
<p>Holcus serratus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its fine texture and ability to thrive in shaded conditions.</p>
