<p>Hydrocotyle mexicana, commonly known as Mexican water pennywort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant features floating or submerged leaves that are usually heart-shaped with a waxy surface, aiding in water retention. Its small white flowers bloom in clusters, often appearing in late summer to early autumn.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle mexicana is valued for its ability to provide habitat for aquatic life and its role in water filtration.</p>
