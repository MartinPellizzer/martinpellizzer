                    <h1>Haynea ovalifolia</h1>
<p>Haynea ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf hayneagrass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically oval in shape, hence its specific epithet. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments due to its tolerance for saline and wind-prone conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes through its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Haynea ovalifolia is also valued for its ornamental potential in coastal landscaping.</p>
