<p>Hypoxis macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited star grass, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers arranged in a star-like pattern, which bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Hypoxis macrocarpa is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.</p>
