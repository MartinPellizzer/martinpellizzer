<p>Hemionitis subargentea, commonly known as the silver fern, is a unique aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, feathery fronds that resemble a fern, though it is not a true fern but a member of the water horsetail family. The plant thrives in shallow, still waters and is characterized by its silvery, waxy appearance on the underside of its leaves. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in water gardens.</p>
