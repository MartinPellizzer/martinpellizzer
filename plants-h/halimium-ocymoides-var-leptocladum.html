                    <h1>Halimium ocymoides var. leptocladum</h1>
<p>Halimium ocymoides var. leptocladum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rockrose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the rocky areas of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable ornamental plant in Mediterranean climates.</p>
