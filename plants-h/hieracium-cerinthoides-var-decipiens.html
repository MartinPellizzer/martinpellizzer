<p>Hieracium cerinthoides var. decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features basal rosettes of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer.
