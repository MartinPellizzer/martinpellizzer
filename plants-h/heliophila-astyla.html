                    <h1>Heliophila astyla</h1>
<p>Heliophila astyla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in water-saturated soils, making it an important species in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Heliophila astyla is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
