<p>Hieracium sarretoides, commonly known as the mouse-ear hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in dry, sunny environments such as meadows and grasslands. The plant has a creeping rootstock that allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats.</p>
<p>Its leaves and flowers are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
