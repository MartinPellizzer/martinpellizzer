                    <h1>Hypodematium phegopteroideum</h1>
<p>Hypodematium phegopteroideum, commonly known as the yellow star moss, is a type of liverwort found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its intricate, star-like leaf arrangement. The plant has a thalloid structure, meaning it lacks true stems and leaves, and instead has a flat, ribbon-like body. It thrives in humid climates and is often found on rocks or soil in forested areas.</p>
<p>Its small, delicate appearance makes it a unique and often overlooked component of woodland ecosystems.</p>
