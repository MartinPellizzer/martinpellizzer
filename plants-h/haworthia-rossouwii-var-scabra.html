<p>Haworthia rossouwii var. scabra, commonly known as the Rossouwâ€™s Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with white or pale markings. The leaves are often covered in a fine, granular texture, giving the plant its common name "scabra," which means rough in Latin. It produces small, white or pale green flowers on tall, slender stems during the summer months.</p>
<p>This plant is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its low maintenance and unique appearance.</p>
