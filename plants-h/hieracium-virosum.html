<p>Hieracium virosum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, with lance-shaped leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native plant species and alter local ecosystems.</p>
