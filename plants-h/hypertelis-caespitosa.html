                    <h1>Hypertelis caespitosa</h1>
<p>Hypertelis caespitosa, commonly known as the dwarf dune grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It forms dense, mat-like growths that help stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. It thrives in harsh, saline environments and is adapted to withstand strong winds and limited water availability.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects along coastal dunes.</p>
