                    <h1>Hygrocharis</h1>
<p>Hygrocharis, commonly known as the water lily of the genus Hygrocharis, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Proteaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat, typically found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of freshwater bodies. The leaves are usually floating or submerged, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The flowers are small and often clustered, with a distinctive structure that includes a showy, petal-like bract.</p>
<p>Hygrocharis species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland ecosystems.</p>
