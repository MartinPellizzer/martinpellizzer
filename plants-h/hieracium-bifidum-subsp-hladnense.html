<p>Hieracium bifidum subsp.</p>
<p>hladnense, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosette of leaves, which are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine pubescence.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and often endangered species in many areas.</p>
