<p>Hippocrepis scabra var. jayana, commonly known as the Jayana helleborine, is a variant of the common helleborine, characterized by its distinctive, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia, typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream sides. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with three petals, which are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous appearance. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a food source for certain Lepidoptera species and its use in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
<p>The varietal form, jayana, is distinguished by specific morphological traits that set it apart from the typical variety of Hippocrepis scabra.</p>
