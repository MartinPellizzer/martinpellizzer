                <h1>Huperzia passerinoides</h1>
<p>Huperzia passerinoides, commonly known as the rock huperzia, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, compact stature and its ability to thrive in rocky or shaded environments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of many ferns. Huperzia passerinoides is often found in temperate regions, particularly in mountainous areas with moist, well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
