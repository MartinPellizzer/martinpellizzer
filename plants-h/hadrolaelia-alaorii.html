<p>Hadrolaelia alaorii, commonly known as the Alborio orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces delicate, fragrant flowers with a unique coloration pattern. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires specific conditions to bloom successfully. Its leaves are usually dark green and strap-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its native habitat.</p>
