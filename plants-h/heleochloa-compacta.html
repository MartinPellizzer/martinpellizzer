                    <h1>Heleochloa compacta</h1>
<p>Heleochloa compacta, commonly known as the compact hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy environments in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It forms dense, mat-like growths with short, stiff blades that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically inconspicuous and wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil in moist habitats.</p>
<p>Heleochloa compacta is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate frequent flooding and poor soil conditions.</p>
