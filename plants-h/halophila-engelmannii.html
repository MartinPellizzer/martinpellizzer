                    <h1>Halophila engelmannii</h1>
<p>Halophila engelmannii, commonly known as the Engelmann's halophyte, is a species of seagrass found in coastal marine environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, brackish waters and is often found in estuaries and tidal zones. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water resistance and facilitate photosynthesis in low-light conditions. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for marine life.</p>
<p>Halophila engelmannii is also important in nutrient cycling and carbon sequestration in coastal ecosystems.</p>
