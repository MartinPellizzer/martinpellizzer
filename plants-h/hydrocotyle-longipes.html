                    <h1>Hydrocotyle longipes</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle longipes, commonly known as the long-peduncled water shield, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often submerged or floating, with long, slender petioles. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize moist soils effectively.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle longipes plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
