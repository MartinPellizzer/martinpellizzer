                    <h1>Hammada recurva</h1>
<p>Hammada recurva, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces a milky sap, which is a common feature among plants in the milkweed family. It has adapted to harsh environments through deep root systems and waxy leaves that reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Hammada recurva plays an important role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies.</p>
