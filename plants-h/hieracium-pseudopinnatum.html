                    <h1>Hieracium pseudopinnatum</h1>
<p>Hieracium pseudopinnatum, commonly known as the false hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and often aromatic foliage. The plant typically features a basal rosette of leaves with a rough, hairy texture, and it produces yellow flowers in the summer months. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats.</p>
