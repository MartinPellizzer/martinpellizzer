<p>Hericinia arvensis, commonly known as the field horned lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its crustose growth form and a yellowish to brownish thallus with distinct, horn-like lobes. The lichen typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in temperate regions, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its chemical composition includes various secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization.</p>
<p>Hericinia arvensis is also used in ecological studies to assess air quality and environmental changes due to its sensitivity to pollutants.</p>
