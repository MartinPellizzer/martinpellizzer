                    <h1>Heliophila tabularis</h1>
<p>Heliophila tabularis, commonly known as the flatleaf water plantain, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Alismataceae family and is characterized by its broad, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread across shallow water bodies, contributing to aquatic ecosystem stability.</p>
<p>Heliophila tabularis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to filter water and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
