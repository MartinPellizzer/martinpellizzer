<p>Haworthia nigra var. angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, dark green leaves that are narrow and pointed, often with a bluish or grayish tinge. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers on short, upright stems during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
