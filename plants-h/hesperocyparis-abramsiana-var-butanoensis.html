<p>Hesperocyparis abramsiana var. butanoensis, commonly known as the Butano canyon cedar, is a rare and endemic conifer native to California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and scale-like foliage that is dark green on top and whitish underneath. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and canyon areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
