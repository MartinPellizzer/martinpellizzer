                    <h1>Hakea riparia</h1>
<p>Hakea riparia, commonly known as the river hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical or cylindrical-branching stems and narrow, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom in spring. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Hakea riparia is often found near water sources such as rivers and wetlands, which contribute to its unique ecological role in these habitats.</p>
