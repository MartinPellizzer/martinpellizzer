                    <h1>Hydroanzia japonica</h1>
<p>Hydroanzia japonica, commonly known as the Japanese water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and marshes, where it forms dense, floating mats. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are adapted for efficient water absorption and photosynthesis. Its rhizomes anchor it to submerged surfaces, while its leaves remain buoyant on the water's surface.</p>
<p>Hydroanzia japonica plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
