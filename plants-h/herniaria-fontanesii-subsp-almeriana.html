<p>Herniaria fontanesii subsp.</p>
<p>almeriana, commonly known as Almerian sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and unique morphology make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
