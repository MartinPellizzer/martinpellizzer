                    <h1>Heliamphora neblinae</h1>
<p>Heliamphora neblinae, commonly known as the Neblina Pitcher Plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the tepuis of Venezuela.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, lidless pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a sticky digestive fluid. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and humid, misty environments. Its pitchers are typically green or red, depending on the light conditions.</p>
<p>Heliamphora neblinae plays an important ecological role by capturing and digesting insects to supplement its nutrient intake.</p>
