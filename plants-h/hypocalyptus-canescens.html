                    <h1>Hypocalyptus canescens</h1>
<p>Hypocalyptus canescens, commonly known as the rough-hairless lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale yellow to orange thallus, which is typically covered in a layer of fine, white or greyish powdery wax. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium. It is often found growing on tree bark, rocks, and soil in temperate and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for air quality and ecological health.</p>
