                    <h1>Habenaria psycodes</h1>
<p>Habenaria psycodes, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green to white, strap-like leaves and its striking, hooded flower that resembles a ghostly face. This epiphytic plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. It has a unique ability to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, rather than from soil.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
