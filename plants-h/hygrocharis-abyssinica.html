                    <h1>Hygrocharis abyssinica</h1>
<p>Hygrocharis abyssinica, commonly known as the Abyssinian water star, is a rare aquatic plant native to the high-altitude lakes of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Hydrocharitaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers that float on the water surface. The plant thrives in still, nutrient-rich waters and has adapted to low-light conditions through its specialized leaf structures. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>However, habitat degradation poses a significant threat to its survival.</p>
