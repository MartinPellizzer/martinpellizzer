                    <h1>Haworthia regina</h1>
<p>Haworthia regina, commonly known as the Queen Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of thick, fleshy, dark green leaves with white markings and translucent windows, which help in photosynthesis and water conservation. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
