                    <h1>Haplopappus venetus var. furfuraceus</h1>
<p>Haplopappus venetus var. furfuraceus, commonly known as the woolly pappus sunflower, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in a pappus, which aids in its propagation. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>This species is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native range.</p>
