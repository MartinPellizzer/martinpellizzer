<p>Hecistopteris kaieteurensis, commonly known as the Kaieteure fern, is a species of fossilized plant from the Carboniferous period.</p>
<p>It belongs to the order Marattiaceae and is characterized by its large, complex fronds with a distinctive venation pattern. The plant is notable for its well-preserved remains found in the Karroo Basin of South Africa. Its structure suggests it was a robust, tropical plant that thrived in swampy environments.</p>
<p>Hecistopteris kaieteurensis provides valuable insights into the paleobotany and ancient ecosystems of the Carboniferous era.</p>
