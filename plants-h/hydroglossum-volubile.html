<p>Hydroglossum volubile, commonly known as the trailing water bellflower, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across moist soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to thrive in waterlogged conditions.</p>
<p>Hydroglossum volubile is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting aquatic ecosystems.</p>
