<p>Hieracium pilosella subsp.</p>
<p>brachiadenum, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
