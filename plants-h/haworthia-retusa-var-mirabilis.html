<p>Haworthia retusa var. mirabilis, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, evergreen succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves with distinctive white to light green markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor and rock garden settings.</p>
