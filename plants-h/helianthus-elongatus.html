<p>Helianthus elongatus, commonly known as the elongated sunflower, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, showy yellow-orange flower heads that resemble those of typical sunflowers. The plant produces numerous ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Native to the southeastern United States, it thrives in moist, sunny habitats like wetlands and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical research.</p>
