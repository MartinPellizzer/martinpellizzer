                    <h1>Hedysarum fruticosum var. mongolicum</h1>
<p>Hedysarum fruticosum var. mongolicum, commonly known as Mongolian broomrape, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the steppes of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant is notable for its lack of chlorophyll, making it a hemiparasitic species that derives some of its nutrients from host plants. It typically grows in dry, open habitats and is often found in association with grasses and other shrubs.</p>
<p>Due to its unique ecological role, it is of interest in studies of plant parasitism and ecosystem dynamics.</p>
