                    <h1>Heuchera hallii var. grossularifolia</h1>
<p>Heuchera hallii var. grossularifolia, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada alumroot, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features basal rosettes of elliptic, dark green to purple foliage that provide striking visual contrast. The plant produces upright clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its delicate, early blooming flowers.</p>
