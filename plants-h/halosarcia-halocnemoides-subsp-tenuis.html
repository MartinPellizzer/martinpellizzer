<p>Halosarcia halocnemoides subsp.</p>
<p>tenuis, commonly known as the slender sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
