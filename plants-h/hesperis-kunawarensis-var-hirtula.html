                    <h1>Hesperis kunawarensis var. hirtula</h1>
<p>Hesperis kunawarensis var. hirtula, commonly known as the Hirtula horned poppy, is a rare and distinctive flowering plant native to specific regions of Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, papery petals that range in color from white to pink, often with a subtle purple tinge. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its unique morphology, including the prominent, horn-like structures on its petals, sets it apart from other members of the Papaveraceae family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
