<p>Helictotrichon pubescens subsp.</p>
<p>laevigatum, commonly known as the smooth hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves that are generally smooth and less hairy compared to other members of the species.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of grassland ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology.</p>
