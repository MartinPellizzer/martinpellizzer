<p>Hartogia sedifolia, commonly known as the sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It has a dense, mat-like growth habit with small, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the cooler months. Its succulent leaves store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Hartogia sedifolia is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland dunes.</p>
