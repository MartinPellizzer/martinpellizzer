<p>Helianthemum contortum, commonly known as the twisted rockrose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It features small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring, typically in clusters at the ends of its branches. The plant has greyish-green, needle-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, helping it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
