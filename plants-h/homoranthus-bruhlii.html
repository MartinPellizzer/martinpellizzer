<p>Homoranthus bruhlii, commonly known as the Broussonet's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees such as Ficus species. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are usually red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can affect the health of its host trees if left unchecked.</p>
