<p>Hypolepis repens, commonly known as the wandering spider-ferns, is a small, terrestrial fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant has a creeping rhizome with fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into delicate, triangular-shaped leaves. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Hypolepis repens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in shaded garden settings.</p>
