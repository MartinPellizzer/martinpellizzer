<p>Hydrostachys myriophylla, commonly known as the African waterwheel, is a striking aquatic plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of bright green, sword-shaped leaves that radiate outward from a central stem. The plant thrives in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its leaves are often submerged, while the uppermost leaves may be partially or fully emergent.</p>
