                    <h1>Hymenophyllum bougainvillense</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum bougainvillense, commonly known as the Bougainville moss, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided, and often hairy leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. This epiphytic plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the leaves, a common feature in many ferns.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
