                    <h1>Haworthia translucens var. delicatula</h1>
<p>Haworthia translucens var. delicatula, commonly known as the translucent haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, tubular leaves that are pale green with translucent, waxy windows, allowing light to penetrate for photosynthesis. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale yellow during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to maintain its unique appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and ornamental leaves, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections.</p>
