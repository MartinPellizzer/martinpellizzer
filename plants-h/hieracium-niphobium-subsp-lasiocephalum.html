<p>Hieracium niphobium subsp.</p>
<p>lasiocephalum, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a flowering stem that bears yellow composite flowers.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its dense, woolly covering on the stem and leaves, which helps protect it from cold and wind. It thrives in rocky, nutrient-poor soils at high altitudes.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine environments and is adapted to harsh climatic conditions.</p>
