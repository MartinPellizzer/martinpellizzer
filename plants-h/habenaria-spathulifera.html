                    <h1>Habenaria spathulifera</h1>
<p>Habenaria spathulifera, commonly known as the broad-leafed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its strap-like, broad leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its root system consists of a short rhizome with fleshy, branched roots that help absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
<p>The orchid's flowers are pollinated by insects, and it relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake, typical of many orchid species.</p>
