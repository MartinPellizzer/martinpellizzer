                    <h1>Hedyotis humifusa</h1>
<p>Hedyotis humifusa, commonly known as the creeping inchplant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are followed by small, oval berries that turn red when mature. Its foliage consists of opposite, ovate leaves with slightly serrated edges, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or stream banks.</p>
<p>Hedyotis humifusa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
