                    <h1>Hyline</h1>
<p>Hyline, commonly known as the "ghost plant," is a unique aquatic plant that thrives in shallow, still water environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its translucent, ribbon-like leaves that float just beneath the water's surface. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on rhizoids for anchorage and nutrient absorption. Hyline is often found in marshes, ponds, and slow-moving streams, where it plays a role in water filtration.</p>
<p>Its delicate appearance and unusual structure make it a subject of interest in both ecological studies and botanical gardens.</p>
