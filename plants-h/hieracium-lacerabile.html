                    <h1>Hieracium lacerabile</h1>
<p>Hieracium lacerabile, commonly known as the torn hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is characterized by its hairy, yellowish-green stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rough texture. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed.</p>
