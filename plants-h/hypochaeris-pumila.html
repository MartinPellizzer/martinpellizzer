                    <h1>Hypochaeris pumila</h1>
<p>Hypochaeris pumila, commonly known as the dwarf hairy cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, hairy leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, due to its adaptability to various conditions. Its hairy stems and leaves help reduce water loss, making it drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Hypochaeris pumila is also known for its ability to spread rapidly through rhizomes, contributing to its invasive potential in some regions.</p>
