<p>Hypodematium daochengense, commonly known as the Daocheng hypodematium, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the high-altitude regions of Tibet, China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hypodematellaceae and is characterized by its unique morphology, including small, leaf-like structures that resemble moss. The plant thrives in cold, moist environments, often growing on rocky substrates at elevations above 4,000 meters. Its limited distribution and specialized habitat make it a subject of interest for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Due to its fragile ecosystem, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance.</p>
