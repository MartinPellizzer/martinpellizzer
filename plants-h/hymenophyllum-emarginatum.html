                    <h1>Hymenophyllum emarginatum</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum emarginatum, commonly known as the emarginate fern, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a thin, membranous layer.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum emarginatum is notable for its ability to retain moisture, which is essential for its survival in its often-dry habitats.</p>
