                            <h1>Hieracium Maculatum Subsp. Fictum</h1>
<p>Hieracium maculatum subsp. fictum is a lesser-known member of the dandelion family known for its striking appearance and ecological significance. This subspecies is characterized by its hairy stems and distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in late spring and early summer. It thrives in a variety of habitats including meadows, woodlands, and disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. Despite its beauty, it is often overlooked in favor of more common dandelion species. Its role in supporting pollinators and maintaining biodiversity makes it an important plant in natural ecosystems.</p>
