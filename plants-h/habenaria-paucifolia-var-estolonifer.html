<p>Habenaria paucifolia var. estolonifer, commonly known as the creeping lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread vegetatively.

Its leaves are grass-like, arranged in a rosette, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in native habitats.</p>
