                    <h1>Hakea beardiana</h1>
<p>Hakea beardiana, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces striking, bottle-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody structure and adaptability to coastal conditions make it a hardy, drought-tolerant species.</p>
<p>Hakea beardiana is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
