<p>It features a compact, branching structure with fleshy, cylindrical stems that often have a spiky appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to tubercles, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Huernia anagaynensis is well adapted to dry climates and requires minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
