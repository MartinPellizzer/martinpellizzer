                    <h1>Herorchis</h1>
<p>Herorchis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white, spider-like flowers and its unique ability to thrive without soil, relying instead on a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi. The plant's roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the air and water, a trait known as epiphytism. Herorchis typically grows on the trunks or branches of trees in wet, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
