                            <h1>Hydrocotyle Craibii</h1>
<p>Craib's groundsel, scientifically known as Hydrocotyle craibii, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. This species belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, white or yellowish flowers. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Craib's groundsel is considered a vulnerable species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Its unique appearance and ecological significance highlight the importance of preserving biodiversity in its native habitat.</p>
