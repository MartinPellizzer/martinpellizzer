<p>Heracleum ursinum, commonly known as giant hogweed, is a tall biennial or perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features large, umbrella-like compound leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in umbrella-shaped inflorescences, which are followed by follicles containing seeds. It is characterized by its thick, hairy stems with purple spots and a strong, unpleasant odor.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it is considered a noxious weed and can cause severe skin irritation.</p>
