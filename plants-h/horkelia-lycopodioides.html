                    <h1>Horkelia lycopodioides</h1>
<p>Horkelia lycopodioides, commonly known as the desert horkelia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Horkelia lycopodioides is adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that help it survive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of desert ecosystems and a subject of interest for botanists studying xerophytic plants.</p>
