                    <h1>Hierochloe antarctica var. brunonis</h1>
<p>Hierochloe antarctica var. brunonis, commonly known as Antarctic hairgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to the cold climates of the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a bluish-green color. This plant thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subantarctic regions. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil in harsh environments, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds for reproduction.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to survive in extreme conditions makes it an important component of polar and high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
