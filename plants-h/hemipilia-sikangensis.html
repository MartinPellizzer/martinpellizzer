                    <h1>Hemipilia sikangensis</h1>
<p>Hemipilia sikangensis, commonly known as the Yunnan orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and striking, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers, which are usually pale pink or white, bloom in late spring or early summer, adding a unique ornamental value to its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemipilia sikangensis is considered a conservation concern.</p>
