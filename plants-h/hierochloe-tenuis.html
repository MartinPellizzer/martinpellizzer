                    <h1>Hierochloe tenuis</h1>
<p>Hierochloe tenuis, commonly known as slender needlegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths on well-drained soils, often found in meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually light green and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought-resistant characteristics. Its inflorescence consists of a slender spikelet with small, spike-like flowers that are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Hierochloe tenuis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
