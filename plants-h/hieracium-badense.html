<p>Hieracium badense, commonly known as the Baden hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the daisy family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Central Europe and is characterized by its yellowish-orange flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces achenes (small, dry fruits) that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Hieracium badense is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its invasive potential.</p>
