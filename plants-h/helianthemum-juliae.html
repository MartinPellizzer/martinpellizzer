                    <h1>Helianthemum juliae</h1>
<p>Helianthemum juliae, commonly known as the Cretan sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in Greece and Turkey.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing evergreen shrub with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat.</p>
