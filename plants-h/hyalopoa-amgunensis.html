<p>Hyalopoa amgunensis, commonly known as the Abugun grass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Hyalopoa amgunensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for livestock in its native habitat.</p>
