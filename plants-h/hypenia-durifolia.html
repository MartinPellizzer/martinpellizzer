                    <h1>Hypenia durifolia</h1>
<p>Hypenia durifolia, commonly known as the hard-leaved hypenia, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Hypenia durifolia is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>
