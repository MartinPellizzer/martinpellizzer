<p>Huperzia takingensis, commonly known as the Taking Mountains huperzia, is a species of moss-like fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered growth habit and leaf-like structures that are often mistaken for true leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporophyte develops a short, thick stem with a single, terminal spore capsule.</p>
<p>Huperzia takingensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
