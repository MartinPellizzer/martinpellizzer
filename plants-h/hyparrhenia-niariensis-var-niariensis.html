                    <h1>Hyparrhenia niariensis var. niariensis</h1>
<p>Hyparrhenia niariensis var. niariensis, commonly known as the African grass or niariensis grass, is a perennial, warm-season grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with dense, narrow leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used for erosion control and as a forage crop.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent and adaptable species in its native habitat.</p>
