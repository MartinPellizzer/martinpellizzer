                    <h1>Hookera setacea</h1>
<p>Hookera setacea, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a low-growing perennial that forms dense, mat-like structures.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, particularly in Peru and Bolivia. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that are densely packed, helping it conserve moisture in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically blue or violet, adding a striking color to the alpine landscape.</p>
<p>Hookera setacea is well adapted to cold temperatures and high UV exposure, making it a unique example of alpine flora.</p>
