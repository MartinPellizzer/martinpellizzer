<p>Hypericum capitatum var. capitatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, dark green leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or as a border plant.</p>
<p>Its medicinal properties have been historically used in traditional remedies, though its use is limited due to potential phototoxic effects.</p>
