<p>Hololepis involucrata, commonly known as the white sand lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale to bright yellowish to whitish thallus, which is usually covered with a dense layer of isidiate structures. This lichen is typically found growing on bare soil, especially in sandy or calcareous substrates, in arid or semi-arid regions. It is known for its ability to tolerate extreme environmental conditions, making it a common indicator species in dry habitats.</p>
<p>The plant's simple morphology and specialized adaptations allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
