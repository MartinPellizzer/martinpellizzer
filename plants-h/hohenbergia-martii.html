                    <h1>Hohenbergia martii</h1>
<p>Hohenbergia martii, commonly known as the silver rosette, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hair, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences that bear showy, pinkish-red flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Hohenbergia martii is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
