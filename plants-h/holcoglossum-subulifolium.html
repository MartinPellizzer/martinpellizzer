                    <h1>Holcoglossum subulifolium</h1>
<p>Holcoglossum subulifolium, commonly known as the needle-leaved holcoglossum, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the summer months. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically growing on rock faces or in forest understories. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires urgent conservation efforts.</p>
