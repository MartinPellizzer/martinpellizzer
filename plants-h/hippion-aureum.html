                    <h1>Hippion aureum</h1>
<p>Hippion aureum, commonly known as golden tamarisk, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It features small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, an adaptation to its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep water sources.</p>
<p>Hippion aureum is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
