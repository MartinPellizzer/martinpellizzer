<p>Hansemannia gogolensis, commonly known as the Gogol's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the wetlands of southern Russia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers with intricate patterns that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and has specialized roots that form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to absorb moisture from the humid air.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, Hansemannia gogolensis is considered critically endangered.</p>
