<p>Heterachne brownii, commonly known as Brown's heterachne, is a species of grass native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands or along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet that is often hidden within the leaf sheaths, making it difficult to detect.</p>
<p>Heterachne brownii is generally short-lived and plays a minor role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
