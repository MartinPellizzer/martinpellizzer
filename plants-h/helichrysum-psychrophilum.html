                    <h1>Helichrysum psychrophilum</h1>
<p>Helichrysum psychrophilum, commonly known as the Antarctic sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Antarctica.</p>
<p>It is one of the few flowering plants that can survive in such extreme cold and low-nutrient environments. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers that are adapted to withstand harsh weather conditions. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss and protect against freezing temperatures.</p>
<p>Helichrysum psychrophilum plays a unique role in the fragile ecosystems of Antarctica, contributing to biodiversity in an otherwise barren landscape.</p>
