                    <h1>Helwingia omeiensis var. omeiensis</h1>
<p>Helwingia omeiensis var. omeiensis, commonly known as the Omei helwingia, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, followed by distinctive, winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in rocky or forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical studies.</p>
