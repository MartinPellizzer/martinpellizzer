                            <h1>Homalium Retusum</h1>
<p>Homalium retusum is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of Asia. It is known for its lush, dark green foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant is often found in moist, shaded areas of forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and private collections. Despite its beauty, Homalium retusum remains relatively obscure in mainstream horticulture.</p>
