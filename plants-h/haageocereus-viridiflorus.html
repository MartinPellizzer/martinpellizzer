                    <h1>Haageocereus viridiflorus</h1>
<p>Haageocereus viridiflorus, commonly known as the green-flowered cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in a layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>This cactus is well adapted to desert environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
