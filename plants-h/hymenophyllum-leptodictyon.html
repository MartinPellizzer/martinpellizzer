<p>Hymenophyllum leptodictyon, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spore moss, is a small, delicate fern typically found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spores in tiny, clustered structures called soridia, which are often found on the underside of the leaves. Its intricate leaf arrangement and specialized reproductive structures make it a unique example of moss-like ferns.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum leptodictyon thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing on rocks or tree trunks.</p>
