                    <h1>Hemianthus reflexus</h1>
<p>Hemianthus reflexus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has slender, ribbon-like leaves that are often curved or twisted, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. It is often found in dense mats near the water's surface, contributing to aquatic habitat structure.</p>
<p>Hemianthus reflexus is valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to stabilize sediment and provide shelter for aquatic organisms.</p>
