                    <h1>Hartighsea billardieri</h1>
<p>Hartighsea billardieri, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique ability to absorb nutrients through its roots directly from the air. The plant produces small, pale green or white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on the trunks of trees in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate nature and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
