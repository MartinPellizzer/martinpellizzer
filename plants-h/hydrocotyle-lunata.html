                    <h1>Hydrocotyle lunata</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle lunata, commonly known as the water pennywort, is a floating aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It has small, round leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern on the water's surface. The plant produces tiny white flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by small, bladder-like fruits. Hydrocotyle lunata thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and ditches.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction make it an important species in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
