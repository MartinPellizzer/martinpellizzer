<p>Hawkesiophyton ochraceum, commonly known as the yellow-flowered cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense, cone-like structures. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it grows in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
