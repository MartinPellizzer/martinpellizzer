                    <h1>Hohenbergia utriculosa</h1>
<p>Hohenbergia utriculosa, commonly known as the bladder bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, overlapping leaves that form a water-storing cup, a feature typical of bromeliads. The leaves are usually dark green with a waxy coating, and they can develop a reddish or purple hue under certain conditions. The plant produces a tall flower spike bearing small, white or pale pink flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Hohenbergia utriculosa is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low light requirements and ability to thrive in humid environments.</p>
