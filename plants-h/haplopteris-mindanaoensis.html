<p>Haplopteris mindanaoensis, commonly known as the Mindanao water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in freshwater environments such as streams and ponds, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Haplopteris mindanaoensis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
