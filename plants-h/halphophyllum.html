                    <h1>Halphophyllum</h1>
<p>Halphophyllum, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, often epiphytic or lithophytic growth habit, typically found on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. The plants produce showy, fragrant flowers with three sepals and three petals, often in vibrant colors such as yellow, orange, or red. Halphophyllum species are adapted to grow in nutrient-poor environments, relying on symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Their unique morphology and ecological adaptations make them an important subject in botanical studies.</p>
