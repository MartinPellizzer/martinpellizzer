<p>Hieracium incisum subsp.</p>
<p>humiliforme, commonly known as the creeping common hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in late summer.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter stature and more spreading growth habit compared to other hawkweed species. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is notable for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments.</p>
