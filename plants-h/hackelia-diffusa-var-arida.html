                    <h1>Hackelia diffusa var. arida</h1>
<p>Hackelia diffusa var. arida, commonly known as desert honeysuckle, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, branched stems covered in fine, grayish hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to minimize transpiration in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>The species is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
