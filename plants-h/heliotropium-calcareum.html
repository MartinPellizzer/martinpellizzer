                    <h1>Heliotropium calcareum</h1>
<p>Heliotropium calcareum, commonly known as the limestone heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, violet-blue flowers. The plant thrives in calcium-rich soils, often found in rocky or limestone areas. Its ability to store water in its leaves makes it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>The flowers emit a sweet, vanilla-like scent, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
