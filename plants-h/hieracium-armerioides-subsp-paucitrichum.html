<p>Hieracium armerioides subsp.</p>
<p>paucitrichum, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The plant has basal leaves that are narrow and linear, and its flowers are yellow, arranged in a flat-topped cluster. It produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and delicate species in many regions.</p>
