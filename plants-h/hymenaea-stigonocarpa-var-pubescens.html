                    <h1>Hymenaea stigonocarpa var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Hymenaea stigonocarpa var. pubescens, commonly known as the yellow rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, pod-like fruits containing flat, elliptical seeds. It is valued for its dense, heavy wood, which is used in furniture and musical instruments.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is also considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
