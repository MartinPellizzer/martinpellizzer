<p>Hieracium viscosum subsp.</p>
<p>viscosiforme, commonly known as the sticky hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and basal rosettes of broad, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in sticky secretions.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, flat-topped clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in some regions and can outcompete native plant species.</p>
