                    <h1>Hakea confertifolia</h1>
<p>Hakea confertifolia, commonly known as the dense-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are densely arranged along its stems, giving it a compact appearance. The plant produces cylindrical, red or orange flower spikes that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody structure and adaptability to dry conditions make it suitable for arid and semi-arid landscapes.</p>
<p>Hakea confertifolia is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
