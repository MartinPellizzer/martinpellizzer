                    <h1>Hemionitis cantangensis</h1>
<p>Hemionitis cantangensis, commonly known as the Tibetan spleenwort, is a rare and enigmatic moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, densely packed leaves that are typically reddish-brown in color, with a distinctive, narrow shape. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, particularly in the mountainous regions of Tibet and adjacent areas of China. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and release spores when mature.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemionitis cantangensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
