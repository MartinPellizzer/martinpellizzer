<p>Heliconia vulcanicola, commonly known as the volcanic heliconia, is a striking tropical plant native to the volcanic regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Heliconiaceae family and is characterized by its large, colorful bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces fragrant, clustered flowers that attract birds and insects, playing a vital role in pollination. Its robust growth habit and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils make it well adapted to its volcanic environment.</p>
