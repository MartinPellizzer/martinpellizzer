                            <h1>Hedyotis Costata Var. Lutescens</h1>
<p>Yellow hedyotis, scientifically known as Hedyotis costata var. lutescens, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. Its vibrant yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring, make it a standout among the genus Hedyotis. This variety is distinguished by its unique coloration and compact growth habit, setting it apart from its green-leaved relatives. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Conservation efforts are crucial to preserving this botanical gem for future generations.</p>
