                    <h1>Hemionitis timida</h1>
<p>Hemionitis timida, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its small, inconspicuous spore-producing structures are typically located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemionitis timida is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
