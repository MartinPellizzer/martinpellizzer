                    <h1>Hyoscyamus vulgaris</h1>
<p>Hyoscyamus vulgaris, commonly known as henbane, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Western Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features a branched stem covered in fine hairs, with alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often glandular-dotted. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by spherical, hairy fruits containing numerous seeds. Henbane contains tropane alkaloids such as hyoscyamine and scopolamine, which have been used historically in medicine and as a hallucinogen.</p>
<p>It is considered toxic to humans and animals, particularly in large doses.</p>
