<p>Hieracium subnivale, commonly known as the snow buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or open habitats at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring before the snow has fully melted. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, helping to retain heat and moisture.</p>
<p>Hieracium subnivale is an important component of alpine ecosystems, supporting various pollinators and contributing to soil stability.</p>
