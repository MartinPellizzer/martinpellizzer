<p>Hymenochaeta tabernaemontani, commonly known as the tabernaemontan hymenochaete, is a species of bracket fungus that belongs to the family Hymenochaetaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tough, woody cap and a distinctive, irregularly shaped stem. The fruiting bodies typically grow on dead wood, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.
