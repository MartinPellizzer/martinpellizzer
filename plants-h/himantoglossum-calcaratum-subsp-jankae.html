<p>Himantoglossum calcaratum subsp.</p>
<p>jankae, commonly known as the Janka's horned orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated flowers with a prominent central spur, which is adapted for pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and rocky habitats, where it forms dense, low-growing clumps. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine, hairy coating that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
