                            <h1>Hieracium Calcareum Subsp. Baldensiforme</h1>
<p>Hieracium calcareum subsp. baldensiforme is a rare and specialized plant species found in specific alpine and rocky habitats. It belongs to the daisy family, Asteraceae, and is known for its unique floral structure and adaptations to harsh environments. This subspecies is distinguished by its pale yellow flowers and compact growth form, which help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this plant from habitat loss and climate change impacts.</p>
