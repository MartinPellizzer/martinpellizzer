                    <h1>Hedera helix var. palmatoaurea</h1>
<p>Hedera helix var. palmatoaurea, commonly known as the golden ivy, is a variant of the common ivy that exhibits striking variegation.</p>
<p>Its leaves are typically larger and more lobed than those of standard Hedera helix, with a distinctive golden-yellow margin and green center. This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and is often used as a decorative climbing plant in both indoor and outdoor settings. It is relatively low maintenance but requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>The variegation is due to a genetic mutation that affects chlorophyll production, resulting in its unique appearance.</p>
