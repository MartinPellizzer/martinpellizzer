                    <h1>Holcus monticola</h1>
<p>Holcus monticola, commonly known as the mountain bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats on rocky or gravelly soils, often found in alpine and mountainous regions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, tolerating cold temperatures and poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
