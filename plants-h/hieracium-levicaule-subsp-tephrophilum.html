<p>Hieracium levicaule subsp.</p>
<p>tephrophilum, commonly known as the tephrophilous hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to regions with acidic soils, particularly in the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as heaths, moors, and rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>The plant features a low-growing rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers with five petals arranged in a single head. It is characterized by its preference for nutrient-poor, acidic environments, which influences its growth habits and distribution.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in association with other acid-tolerant flora, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat.</p>
