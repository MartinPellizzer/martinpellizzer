<p>Humboltia villosa, commonly known as the hairy humboldtia, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal areas, characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in coastal environments.</p>
<p>Humboltia villosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in mild climates.</p>
