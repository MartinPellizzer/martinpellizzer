<p>Helianthemum nummularium subsp.</p>
<p>glabrum, commonly known as the smooth stonecress, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to southern Europe. It features small, rounded, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, sunny environments.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
