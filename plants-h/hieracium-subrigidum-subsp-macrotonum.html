<p>Hieracium subrigidum subsp.</p>
<p>macrotonum, commonly known as the large-headed hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and basal rosettes of spoon-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a single, showy head, which is typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from other hieracium species, particularly in leaf structure and flower size.</p>
