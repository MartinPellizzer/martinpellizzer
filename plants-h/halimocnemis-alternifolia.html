The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are usually yellow or white in color, typical of many members of its family. It is native to specific regions in Africa, where it thrives in arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to harsh climates.</p>
