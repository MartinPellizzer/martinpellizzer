                            <h1>Hieracium Decrescentifolium</h1>
<p>Common hawkweed, scientifically known as Hieracium decrescentifolium, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the sunflower family, Asteraceae, and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy stems, which help it thrive in diverse environments. Despite its beauty, it is considered an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation. Its ecological impact and ornamental value make it a subject of both admiration and concern.</p>
