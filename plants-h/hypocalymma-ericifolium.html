                    <h1>Hypocalymma ericifolium</h1>
<p>Hypocalymma ericifolium, commonly known as the woolly hypocalymma, is a small shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which provide additional protection against intense sunlight and drought.</p>
<p>Hypocalymma ericifolium is well adapted to low-nutrient soils and can survive in areas with minimal rainfall.</p>
