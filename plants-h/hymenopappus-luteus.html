<p>Hymenopappus luteus, commonly known as the yellow burweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive bracts. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are surrounded by pale green to brown bracts, which are often mistaken for leaves. Hymenopappus luteus is an annual herb that thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in desert and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>Its seeds are dispersed by wind, aided by the hairy pappus that attaches to the seed and allows it to travel considerable distances.</p>
