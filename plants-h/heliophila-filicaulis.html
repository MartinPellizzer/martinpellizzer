<p>Heliophila filicaulis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heliophyte, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marsh environments in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are linear and often have a slightly hairy texture, while its flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn.</p>
<p>Heliophila filicaulis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize wetland soils and support local biodiversity.</p>
