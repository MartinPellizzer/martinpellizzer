<p>Helianthemum vulgare var. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered rock rose, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in sunny, arid environments.
