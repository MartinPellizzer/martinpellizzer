                    <h1>Hymenophyllum opacum</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum opacum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, velvety fronds that are covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes, which help reduce water loss. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are located on the underside of its fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
