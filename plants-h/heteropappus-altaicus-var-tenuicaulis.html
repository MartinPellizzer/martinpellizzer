<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with hairy, cylindrical stems that are typically less than 20 cm in height. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems, which bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are linear and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This species is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited to drought conditions.</p>
