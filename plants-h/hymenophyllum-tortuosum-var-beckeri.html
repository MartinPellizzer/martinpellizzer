                    <h1>Hymenophyllum tortuosum var. beckeri</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum tortuosum var. beckeri, commonly known as the Becker's filmy fern, is a member of the Hymenophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds.</p>
<p>It is a small epiphytic or lithophytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in moist, shaded environments. The fronds are usually narrow, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its intricate leaf structure and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
