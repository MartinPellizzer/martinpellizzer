<p>Hieracium saxifragum subsp.</p>
<p>saxigenum, commonly known as the saxifrage hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in alpine or subalpine environments. It has a creeping growth habit with stolons that help it spread across open ground.</p>
<p>The subspecies saxigenum is distinguished by its more robust growth and slightly different leaf morphology compared to other members of the Hieracium genus.</p>
