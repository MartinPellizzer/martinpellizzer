                    <h1>Hemithrinax ekmaniana</h1>
<p>Hemithrinax ekmaniana, commonly known as the Cuban pine, is a rare cycad native to the island of Cuba.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, compound leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its seeds are enclosed in a hard, woody capsule and are dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Hemithrinax ekmaniana is considered endangered and is protected in its native range.</p>
