<p>Hymenopappus engelmannianus, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual plant that typically grows in rocky soils and desert environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>The species is characterized by its unique pappus, a structure that aids in seed dispersal by the wind.</p>
