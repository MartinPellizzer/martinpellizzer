<p>Haworthia incurvula, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, triangular leaves with distinctive white tubercles that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers on slender stems during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
