<p>Hieraciodes pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf sandwort, is a small, mat-forming plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. The plant has tiny, clustered leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers. It is often found in high-altitude areas where few other plants can survive.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
