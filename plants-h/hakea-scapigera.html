                    <h1>Hakea scapigera</h1>
<p>Hakea scapigera, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces cylindrical, red or yellowish flower spikes that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody structure and ability to thrive in dry, sandy soils make it well adapted to its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Hakea scapigera is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>
