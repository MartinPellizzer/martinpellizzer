                    <h1>Hydrosme prieuriana</h1>
<p>Hydrosme prieuriana, commonly known as the Prieur's hydrosme, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
