                    <h1>Heterotropa fudsinoi</h1>
<p>Heterotropa fudsinoi, commonly known as the Fudsinoi ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and elongated, pendulous inflorescence that bears clusters of small, pale green flowers. The plant exhibits a unique symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake. Due to its restricted habitat and fragile ecological requirements, it is highly threatened by habitat loss and climate change.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this elusive botanical wonder.</p>
