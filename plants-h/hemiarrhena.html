                    <h1>Hemiarrhena</h1>
<p>Hemiarrhena, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their succulent leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. Hemiarrhena species are typically shrubs or small trees, adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. Their fibrous roots allow them to store water efficiently, making them resilient in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the ecological balance of their native habitats.</p>
