<p>Hemipteris werneri, commonly known as the Werneri's bladder fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a smooth, waxy surface, and its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
