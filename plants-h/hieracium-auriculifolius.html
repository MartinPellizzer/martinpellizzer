<p>Hieracium auriculifolius, commonly known as the auriculate hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, with basal leaves that are broadly ovate and often have auriculate (ear-like) lobes at the base. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats.</p>
