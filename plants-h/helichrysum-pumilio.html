<p>Helichrysum pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf golden everlasting, is a small, perennial shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, golden-yellow flowers that resemble tiny sunflowers. The plant produces papery, persistent bracts that remain after the flowers have faded, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to retain its color and form throughout the year.</p>
