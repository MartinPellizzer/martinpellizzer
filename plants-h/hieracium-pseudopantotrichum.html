<p>Hieracium pseudopantotrichum, commonly known as the false yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, often becoming invasive in some areas. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and spreading habit, it can outcompete native vegetation, making it a concern in ecological management.</p>
