<p>Huntleya lucida, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and striking plant native to the arid regions of western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, translucent, waxy leaves that appear almost ghostly in appearance, especially under sunlight. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and distinctive appearance, Huntleya lucida is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
