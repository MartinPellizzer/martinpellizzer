                    <h1>Hexaphoma viscida</h1>
<p>Hexaphoma viscida, commonly known as the sticky leaf fungus or sticky blight fungus, is a parasitic fungus that primarily affects plants in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ability to produce a sticky, viscous substance that coats the infected plant tissues. The fungus typically colonizes the leaves, stems, and sometimes the flowers of its host, leading to discoloration and wilting. Its life cycle involves the production of spores that are dispersed by wind or water.</p>
<p>Hexaphoma viscida is often found in warm, humid environments where its host plants thrive.</p>
