<p>Hygrophila hirsuta, commonly known as hairy hygrophila, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely serrated leaves and dense, branching stems that thrive in slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of rivers, where it can tolerate fluctuating water levels. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters and are typically short-lived, contributing to its role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Hygrophila hirsuta is also popular in aquariums due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation.</p>
