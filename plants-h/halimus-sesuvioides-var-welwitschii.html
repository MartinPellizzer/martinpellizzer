                    <h1>Halimus sesuvioides var. welwitschii</h1>
<p>Halimus sesuvioides var. welwitschii, commonly known as Welwitsch's halimus, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems and small, pale green leaves that are adapted to store water. The plant produces yellow flowers during the wet season, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is highly drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is often found in rocky outcrops and sandy plains.</p>
