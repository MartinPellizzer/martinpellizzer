                    <h1>Hemiambrosia heterocephala</h1>
<p>Hemiambrosia heterocephala, commonly known as the two-headed ambrosia beetle, is a species of ambrosia beetle found in tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>This beetle is notable for its unique morphology, featuring two distinct head shapes on a single body, which is an unusual characteristic among insects. The larvae of Hemiambrosia heterocephala feed on fungal cultures that the adult females cultivate within the tree bark. These fungi provide the primary nutrition for both the larvae and adult beetles.</p>
<p>The plant's association with specific host trees, such as certain species of Moraceae, is crucial for its life cycle and ecological role.</p>
