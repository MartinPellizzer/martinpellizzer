                    <h1>Harmala multifida</h1>
<p>Harmala multifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved false indigo, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. Harmala multifida is adapted to dry conditions and has a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>It is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its chemical composition remains under study.</p>
