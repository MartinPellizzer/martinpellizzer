                    <h1>Hydropeltis</h1>
<p>Hydropeltis, commonly known as the water lily, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Nymphaeaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their floating leaves and showy, waterborne flowers that typically open in the morning. Hydropeltis species are native to temperate regions and are often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Their roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of ponds or lakes, while their leaves float on the water's surface.</p>
<p>The flowers of Hydropeltis play an important role in attracting pollinators such as beetles and bees.</p>
