                    <h1>Haloragis nemorosa</h1>
<p>Haloragis nemorosa, commonly known as the water starwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and streamside habitats in eastern North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 10â€“30 cm, with slender, branching stems that are often submerged or partially emergent. The plant features small, opposite, ovate leaves with a waxy coating, which help reduce water loss in its aquatic or semi-aquatic environment. Its flowers are tiny, clustered in dense spikes, and are usually greenish-white in color, blooming from June to September.</p>
<p>Haloragis nemorosa plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
