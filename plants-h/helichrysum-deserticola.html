                    <h1>Helichrysum deserticola</h1>
<p>Helichrysum deserticola, commonly known as the desert everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, yellowish-orange flowers that are tightly packed in dense, spherical clusters. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to harsh desert conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and grayish-green, which helps reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>The plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and resilience in low-maintenance gardens.</p>
