The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a bluish-green hue due to the presence of dense pubescence.</p>
<p>Helictotrichon tibesticum is adapted to harsh, cold environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
