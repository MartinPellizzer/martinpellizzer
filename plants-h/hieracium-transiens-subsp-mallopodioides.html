<p>Hieracium transiens subsp.</p>
<p>mallopodioides, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit.</p>
<p>The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in composite flower heads. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions.</p>
