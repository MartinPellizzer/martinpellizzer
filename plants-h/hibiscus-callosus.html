                    <h1>Hibiscus callosus</h1>
<p>Hibiscus callosus, commonly known as the wooly hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, velvety stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, often with a contrasting yellow throat. Hibiscus callosus thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens.</p>
