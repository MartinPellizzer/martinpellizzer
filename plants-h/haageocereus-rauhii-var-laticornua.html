<p>Haageocereus rauhii var. laticornua, commonly known as the broad-horned cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that are often covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and adaptation to harsh conditions make it a striking addition to arid landscapes.</p>
