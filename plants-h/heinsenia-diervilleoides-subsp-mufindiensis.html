<p>Heinsenia diervilleoides subsp.</p>
<p>mufindiensis, commonly known as the Mufindi heinsenia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Africa. It is a perennial herb characterized by its erect stem and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in cooler, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution.</p>
