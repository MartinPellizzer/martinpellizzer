                    <h1>Hemionitis aurea</h1>
<p>Hemionitis aurea, commonly known as the golden flax or golden hemionitis, is a rare and unique fern native to the arid regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, bright yellow foliage, which contrasts sharply with its slender, wiry stems. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and has adapted to extreme environmental conditions. Its fronds are typically small and narrow, often curling into a rosette shape for moisture retention.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemionitis aurea is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
