                    <h1>Hypserpa neocaledonica</h1>
<p>Hypserpa neocaledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonia cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the island of New Caledonia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
