                    <h1>Hakea sphacelata</h1>
<p>Hakea sphacelata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces striking, bottle-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its root system is adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Hakea sphacelata is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and resilience.</p>
