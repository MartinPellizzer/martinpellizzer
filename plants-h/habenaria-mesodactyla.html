<p>Habenaria mesodactyla, commonly known as the narrow-lobed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream sides. Its leaves are linear and arranged in two rows along the stem.</p>
<p>Like many orchids, it has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake.</p>
