<p>Hieracium faurei subsp.</p>
<p>glacielloides, commonly known as the glacier hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in cold, rocky environments, often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to low-nutrient soils and is often found in association with other alpine flora.</p>
