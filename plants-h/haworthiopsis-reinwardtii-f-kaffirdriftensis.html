<p>Haworthiopsis reinwardtii f. kaffirdriftensis, commonly known as the Kaffirdrift Haworthia, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense rosettes of fleshy, blue-gray leaves with white to yellowish markings, which help it store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces tall, branched flower stalks bearing small, white or pale green flowers, typically in spring or summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its unique appearance and ease of care, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections.</p>
