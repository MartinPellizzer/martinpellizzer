                    <h1>Helianthemum vulgare var. tomentosum</h1>
<p>Helianthemum vulgare var. tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly rock rose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features dense, gray-green foliage covered in a fine, woolly pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in spring, adding a bright touch to rocky or sandy soils. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Its compact form and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and garden borders.</p>
