                    <h1>Helietta apiculata</h1>
<p>Helietta apiculata, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are often covered in tiny bladder-like structures used to trap aquatic prey. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, where it can efficiently capture small insects and crustaceans. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, and they appear in clusters above the water surface.</p>
<p>Helietta apiculata plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling within its aquatic ecosystem.</p>
