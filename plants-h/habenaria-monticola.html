                    <h1>Habenaria monticola</h1>
<p>Habenaria monticola, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it thrives in well-drained, humus-rich soil. The plant produces slender, grass-like leaves and bears small, greenish-white flowers with intricate patterns. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the soil, a common adaptation in orchids.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions.</p>
