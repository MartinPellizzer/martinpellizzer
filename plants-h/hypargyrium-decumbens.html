<p>Hypargyrium decumbens, commonly known as the decumbent silverleaf, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically opposite and covered in fine, reflective hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations.</p>
<p>Hypargyrium decumbens plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various insects and small animals.</p>
