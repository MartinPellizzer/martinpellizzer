                    <h1>Hemiandra rupestris</h1>
<p>Hemiandra rupestris, commonly known as the rock hemiandra, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink, arranged in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Hemiandra rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
