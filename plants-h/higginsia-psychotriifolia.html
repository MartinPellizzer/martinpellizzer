                    <h1>Higginsia psychotriifolia</h1>
<p>Higginsia psychotriifolia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, delicate, and ephemeral blooms that appear only during brief periods of rainfall. The plant has a low-growing, succulent structure with fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions. Its flowers are typically small, white or pale blue, and emit a faint, sweet fragrance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Higginsia psychotriifolia is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat loss.</p>
