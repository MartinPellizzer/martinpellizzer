<p>Hieracium fagicola, commonly known as the forest dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and forest floors, where it thrives in the dappled light beneath tree canopies. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its yellow flowers, which appear in late spring to early summer, are surrounded by bracts that resemble petals.</p>
<p>Hieracium fagicola is known for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora.</p>
