<p>Hieracium murorum subsp.</p>
<p>stelligerum, commonly known as the coastal hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its yellow flower heads, which are typically composed of numerous small disc florets.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often growing in open, sunny habitats near the shoreline. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in saline environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to withstand coastal winds and salt spray, making it a resilient member of coastal plant communities.</p>
