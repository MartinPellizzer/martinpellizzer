                    <h1>Hieracium orientale</h1>
<p>Hieracium orientale, commonly known as the oriental hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its roots form a dense network that helps it spread aggressively.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats.</p>
