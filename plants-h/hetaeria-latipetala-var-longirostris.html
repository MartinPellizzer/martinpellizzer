<p>Hetaeria latipetala var. longirostris, commonly known as the long-beaked hetaeria, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Araceae, characterized by its unique inflorescence structure known as a spadix, enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity and partial light. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, while the flowers are small and clustered, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture.</p>
