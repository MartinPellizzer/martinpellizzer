                    <h1>Hordeum sativum</h1>
<p>Hordeum sativum, commonly known as barley, is a cereal grain native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, three-lobed spikelets that contain several rows of hard, amber-colored grains. Barley is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is typically cultivated for its seeds, which are used in food, animal feed, and brewing. The plant has a short stature with a fibrous root system and is adapted to a wide range of soil types.</p>
<p>Its reproductive cycle is influenced by photoperiod, making it a cool-season crop.</p>
