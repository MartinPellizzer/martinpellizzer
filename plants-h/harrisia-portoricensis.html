                    <h1>Harrisia portoricensis</h1>
<p>Harrisia portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican nightshade, is a cactus species native to the island of Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing plant with spineless stems that are often covered in small, globose fruits. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its adaptations to the humid, tropical climate include succulent stems that store water and reduce transpiration.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution.</p>
