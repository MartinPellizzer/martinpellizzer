                    <h1>Henriettea loretensis</h1>
<p>Henriettea loretensis, commonly known as the Loretto's henriettea, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Henriettea loretensis is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
