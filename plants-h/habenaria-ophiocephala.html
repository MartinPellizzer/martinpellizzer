<p>Habenaria ophiocephala, commonly known as the snakehead orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, snake-like appearance of its flower spikes, which are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forest floors and rocky areas. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a distinct, elongated spur.</p>
<p>The orchid's morphology reflects adaptations to its specific ecological niche, supporting its survival in humid, tropical environments.</p>
