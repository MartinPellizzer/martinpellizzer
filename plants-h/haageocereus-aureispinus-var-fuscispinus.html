<p>Haageocereus aureispinus var. fuscispinus, commonly known as the dark-spined hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, dark spines that provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its spiny structure. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes.</p>
