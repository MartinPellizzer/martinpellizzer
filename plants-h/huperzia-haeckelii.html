                    <h1>Huperzia haeckelii</h1>
<p>Huperzia haeckelii, commonly known as the Haeckel's clubmoss, is a species of evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that produce small, scale-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Huperzia haeckelii is notable for its ability to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in structures known as strobila, typical of many primitive vascular plants.</p>
