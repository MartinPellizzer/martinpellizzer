                    <h1>Huperzia rufescens</h1>
<p>Huperzia rufescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed clubmoss, is a species of fern ally native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, herbaceous habit and its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical formations called strobila. Huperzia rufescens typically thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its rhizome system is well-developed, allowing it to spread and colonize various substrates effectively.</p>
