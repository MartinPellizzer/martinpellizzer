                    <h1>Hemionitis mucronata</h1>
<p>Hemionitis mucronata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a small aquatic fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as marshes and ponds. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds that are often submerged or floating. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Hemionitis mucronata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
