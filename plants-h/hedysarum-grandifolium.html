The plant produces small, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds, and it is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Hedysarum grandifolium has a deep root system that helps it thrive in arid conditions, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>It is valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
