<p>Hymenophyllum multifidum, commonly known as the forked fern, is a small, delicate epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lanceolate leaves that often appear in a rosette formation. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum multifidum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant.</p>
