                    <h1>Hordeum murinum var. pedicellatum</h1>
<p>Hordeum murinum var. pedicellatum, commonly known as mouse barley, is a wild grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often tufted stems and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>This variety is often considered a weed but has ecological value in supporting insect populations and soil stability.</p>
