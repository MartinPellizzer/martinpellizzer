<p>Huperzia lindaviana, commonly known as the Lindaviana spikemoss, is a species of fern-like plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and its possession of true leaves with vascular tissue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth or on rocky substrates. Its sporophytes produce spores on the underside of its leaves, which are dispersed to initiate new growth.</p>
<p>Huperzia lindaviana is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and contributing to forest biodiversity.</p>
