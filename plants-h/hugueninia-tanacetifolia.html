                    <h1>Hugueninia tanacetifolia</h1>
<p>Hugueninia tanacetifolia, commonly known as the mountain huckleberry, is a shrub native to the high elevations of the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with dense clusters of small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, edible berries that ripen to a dark purple or black color. Its leaves are typically arranged in a whorled pattern, and the plant is well adapted to cold, dry, and rocky environments.</p>
<p>Hugueninia tanacetifolia is an important component of alpine and subalpine ecosystems, providing food for various wildlife species.</p>
