<p>Hymenophyllum pollenianum, commonly known as the Pollenian mossy fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, moss-like appearance with finely divided, hair-like fronds. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum pollenianum plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing microhabitats for small organisms.</p>
