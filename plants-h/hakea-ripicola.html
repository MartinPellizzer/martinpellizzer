                    <h1>Hakea ripicola</h1>
<p>Hakea ripicola, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, needle-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its seeds are enclosed in woody follicles that open to release seeds when mature.</p>
<p>Hakea ripicola is often found in coastal heathlands and sandy soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
