<p>Heracleum orsinii, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, umbrella-like compound leaves and clusters of white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant contains phototoxic sap that can cause severe skin irritation when exposed to sunlight. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils along riverbanks and roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions.</p>
