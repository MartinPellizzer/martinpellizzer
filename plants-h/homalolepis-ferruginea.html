                    <h1>Homalolepis ferruginea</h1>
<p>Homalolepis ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, rusty-colored bloom, which gives it its common name.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, or sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
