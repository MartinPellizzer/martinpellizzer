<p>It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas.</p>
