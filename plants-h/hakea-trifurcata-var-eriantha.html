<p>Hakea trifurcata var. eriantha, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rigid, spine-tipped leaves and clusters of small, urn-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces woody, cone-like fruits that contain seeds with tufts of silky hair, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and inland heathlands.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to dry conditions and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
