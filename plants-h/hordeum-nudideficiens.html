                    <h1>Hordeum nudideficiens</h1>
<p>Hordeum nudideficiens, commonly known as the naked-leaved barley, is a wild grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and small, pale spikelets that lack the bristles found in many other barley species. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in sagebrush communities. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it produces small, hard grains that are adapted for dispersal by wind.</p>
<p>Hordeum nudideficiens is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological role and its potential for genetic research.</p>
