                    <h1>Habenaria diffusa</h1>
<p>Habenaria diffusa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Habenaria diffusa is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
