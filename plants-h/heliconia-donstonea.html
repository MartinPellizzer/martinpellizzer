<p>Heliconia donstonea, commonly known as the red-veined heliconia, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its large, brightly colored bracts that resemble flowers. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that are often hidden within the fleshy, leaf-like structures. Its leaves are broad, elliptical, and covered with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat.</p>
<p>Heliconia donstonea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects.</p>
