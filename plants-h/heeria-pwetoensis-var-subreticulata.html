The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in montane forests. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, reticulate pattern, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
