                    <h1>Haplopappus stolpii</h1>
<p>Haplopappus stolpii, commonly known as the Stolpi's hairyweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and typical sunflower-like appearance. The plant has small, green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowering period typically occurs in the summer months, producing yellow flowers that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
