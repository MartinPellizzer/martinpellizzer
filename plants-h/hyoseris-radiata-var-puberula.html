                    <h1>Hyoseris radiata var. puberula</h1>
<p>Hyoseris radiata var. puberula, commonly known as the hairy sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and narrow, hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is known for its bright yellow ray flowers and a central disk of smaller florets. Its hairy texture, which gives it its common name, helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>
