                    <h1>Habenaria achroantha</h1>
<p>Habenaria achroantha, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and fascinating orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and its unique, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks a visible leaf structure, relying instead on its stem for photosynthesis. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in the understory of forests.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate and is highly valued in botanical research.</p>
