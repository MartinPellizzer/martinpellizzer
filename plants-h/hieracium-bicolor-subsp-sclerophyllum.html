<p>Hieracium bicolor subsp.</p>
<p>sclerophyllum, commonly known as the hard-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its rough, waxy leaves that are adapted to arid environments. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, often in regions with a Mediterranean climate.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often densely hairy, providing protection against water loss and herbivory.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its ecological resilience and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
