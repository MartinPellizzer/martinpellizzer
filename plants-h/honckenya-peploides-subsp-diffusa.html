<p>Honckenya peploides subsp.</p>
<p>diffusa, commonly known as the coastal beardgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and coastal regions of the western United States. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, followed by spikelets that disperse seeds by wind. Its root system is extensive and adapted to stabilize sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is particularly resilient to salt spray and drought, making it a common pioneer species in coastal dunes.</p>
