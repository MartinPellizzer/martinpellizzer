                    <h1>Hypobathrum glomeratum</h1>
<p>Hypobathrum glomeratum, commonly known as the clustered sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its dry habitat. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in sandy soils and access moisture from deeper underground.</p>
<p>Hypobathrum glomeratum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment.</p>
