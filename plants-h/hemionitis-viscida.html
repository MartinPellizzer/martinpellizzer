                    <h1>Hemionitis viscida</h1>
<p>Hemionitis viscida, commonly known as the sticky hemionitis, is a rare and delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are covered in a fine, sticky substance, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats. Its reproductive structures are inconspicuous, and it relies on spore dispersal for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemionitis viscida is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
