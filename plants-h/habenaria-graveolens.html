                    <h1>Habenaria graveolens</h1>
<p>Habenaria graveolens, commonly known as the stinking orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that emit a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts its primary pollinatorsâ€”flies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and fragrance, it is a subject of interest in both botanical research and horticulture.</p>
