<p>Haynaldia hordeacea var. velutina, commonly known as the velvet barleygrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects.</p>
