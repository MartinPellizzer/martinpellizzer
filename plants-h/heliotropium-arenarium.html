<p>Heliotropium arenarium, commonly known as sand heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, succulent shrub that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes and coastal plains. The plant produces small, violet or purple flowers that open in the morning and close in the afternoon, a behavior known as nyctinasty. Its leaves are typically narrow and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Heliotropium arenarium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xerophytic gardens.</p>
