                    <h1>Hannoa kitombetombe</h1>
<p>Hannoa kitombetombe, commonly known as the "Kilimanjaro orchid," is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the montane forests of Tanzania.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in late winter. The plant typically grows at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters above sea level, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its root system is adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, humus-laden soils of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hannoa kitombetombe is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
