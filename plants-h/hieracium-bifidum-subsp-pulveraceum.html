<p>Hieracium bifidum subsp.</p>
<p>pulveraceum, commonly known as the powdered hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering stems that bear yellow, daisy-like flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry meadows, grasslands, and rocky soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which gives it its common name and helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller, more compact flowers compared to other members of the Hieracium genus.</p>
