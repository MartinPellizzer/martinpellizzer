<p>Hymenophyllum mirificum, commonly known as the silver moss, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of minute, scale-like structures that give it a silvery appearance.</p>
<p>This unique morphology helps it retain moisture and withstand environmental stress.</p>
