<p>Habenaria edentula, commonly known as the toothless orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky areas. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>The orchid's lack of prominent teeth on its petals is a distinguishing feature, contributing to its common name.</p>
