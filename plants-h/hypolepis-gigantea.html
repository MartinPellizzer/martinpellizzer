<p>Hypolepis gigantea, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes form a dense network that helps stabilize the soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The fronds are divided into pinnae, which are serrated and have a distinctive, feathery appearance.</p>
