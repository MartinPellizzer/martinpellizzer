<p>Hypericum pseudopetiolatum f. nigrostriatum, commonly known as the black-striped St. John's wort, is a unique variant of the St. John's wort genus.</p>

It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The foliage is often used in herbal remedies, though its medicinal properties are less well-documented compared to other Hypericum species.</p>
