                    <h1>Hydrocotyle mannii</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle mannii, commonly known as the African water shield, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to submerged soil conditions. The plant has rounded, floating leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small white or yellowish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle mannii is also known for its medicinal uses in traditional African medicine.</p>
