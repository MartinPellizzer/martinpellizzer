                    <h1>Hedysarum conjunctum</h1>
<p>Hedysarum conjunctum, commonly known as the jointed milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia.</p>
<p>Hedysarum conjunctum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in restoration projects.</p>
