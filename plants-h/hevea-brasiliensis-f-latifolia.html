                    <h1>Hevea brasiliensis f. latifolia</h1>
<p>Hevea brasiliensis f. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf rubber tree, is a variant of the rubber tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often larger than those of the typical Hevea brasiliensis. This form is valued for its unique foliage, making it a popular choice in ornamental horticulture. The plant produces rubber latex, similar to its parent species, though it is less commonly used for commercial rubber production.</p>
<p>It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.</p>
