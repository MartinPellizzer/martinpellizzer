<p>Hypolepis rugosula subsp.</p>
<p>pradoana, commonly known as the Prado's shield fern, is a tropical fern species native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the substrate.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bioluminescent, which aids in attracting certain pollinators and enhancing its ecological role in the ecosystem.</p>
