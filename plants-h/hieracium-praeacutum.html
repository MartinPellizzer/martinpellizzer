<p>Hieracium praeacutum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture, and its flowers are yellow with a central disk.</p>
<p>It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes.</p>
