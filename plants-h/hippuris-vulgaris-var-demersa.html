                    <h1>Hippuris vulgaris var. demersa</h1>
<p>Hippuris vulgaris var. demersa, commonly known as the water shield, is a aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and has distinctive floating leaves that are heart-shaped with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that emerge above the water surface. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize sediments and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The leaves are often submerged, while the upper ones float, allowing the plant to thrive in wetland ecosystems.</p>
