The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>Due to its robust growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it is considered a common but sometimes invasive species in certain regions.</p>
