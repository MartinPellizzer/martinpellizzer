<p>Herniaria hirsuta subsp.</p>
<p>hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy herniaria, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and coastal areas of Europe and western Asia. It features small, fleshy, green leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from June to August. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in poor soils make it a resilient species often found in disturbed or marginal habitats.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its dense hirsute covering and robust, succulent stems.</p>
