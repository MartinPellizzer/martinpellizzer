<p>Holographis tolantongensis, commonly known as the Tolantongo ghost fern, is a rare and enigmatic species native to the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae, characterized by its delicate, leathery leaves and intricate venation patterns. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in montane forests. Its unique morphology includes translucent, almost ghostly fronds that give it its common name.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
