                    <h1>Hedysarum fruticosum var. lignosum</h1>
<p>Hedysarum fruticosum var. lignosum, commonly known as the creeping yellow vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant characterized by its woody stems and climbing or trailing growth habit.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in racemes, and its leaves are trifoliate with small, oval leaflets. The plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is often found in dry, rocky, or sandy soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its more woody structure compared to the non-woody form of Hedysarum fruticosum.</p>
