                    <h1>Hymenophyllum alveolatum</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum alveolatum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, moss-like fronds that are often covered in tiny, raised dots called hydathodes. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on rocks or tree bark. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum alveolatum is notable for its unique morphology and its ability to absorb moisture from the air.</p>
