<p>Haloxylon griffithii subsp.</p>
<p>griffithii, commonly known as the Afghan date palm, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and thick, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by edible, date-like fruits. It is well adapted to extreme drought conditions, storing water in its trunk and leaves.</p>
<p>This subspecies is important in desert ecosystems for its role in stabilizing soil and providing food for wildlife.</p>
