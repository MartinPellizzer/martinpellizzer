<p>Haworthia schuldtiana, commonly known as the Schuldt's Haworthia, is a compact, succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves with white tubercles and translucent windows, which aid in photosynthesis and water conservation. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, white to pale purple flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor and rock garden cultivation.</p>
