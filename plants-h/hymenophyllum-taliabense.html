<p>Hymenophyllum taliabense, commonly known as the Taliabu fern, is a species of moss-like liverwort found in tropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pterobryaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate, and often pale green to brownish thallus. The plant lacks true leaves and roots, instead having a structure called a thallus that absorbs water and nutrients through its surface. It typically grows on damp, shaded surfaces such as rocks or tree trunks in humid environments.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum taliabense plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates.</p>
