<p>Hippodamia insignis, commonly known as the golden shield ladybird, is a species of ladybug native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow body with distinctive red or orange markings. The plant it is associated with, though not a plant itself, is often found in habitats where its prey, such as aphids, are abundant. Its larvae are typically black with red or orange stripes, and they feed on soft-bodied insects.</p>
<p>This ladybird plays an important role in biological control by preying on harmful pests in agricultural and garden settings.</p>
