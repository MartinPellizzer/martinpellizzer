                    <h1>Helictotrichon alpinum</h1>
<p>Helictotrichon alpinum, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with narrow, bluish-gray leaves that are adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and tundra habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and resilience.</p>
