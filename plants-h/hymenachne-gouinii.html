                    <h1>Hymenachne gouinii</h1>
<p>Hymenachne gouinii, commonly known as the Gouin's flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its flat, grass-like leaves and spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, where it thrives in saturated soil conditions. Hymenachne gouinii is often found in association with other aquatic or semi-aquatic vegetation, contributing to the structural complexity of these ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland biodiversity and ecological studies.</p>
