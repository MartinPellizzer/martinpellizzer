<p>Hydriastele brassii, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking yellow and green floral structure, which resembles a star, hence its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Hydriastele brassii is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures rather than in soil.</p>
<p>It requires high humidity and indirect sunlight to thrive, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation.</p>
