<p>Hoelzelia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plants are characterized by their heart-shaped leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. Hoelzelia species often have a rough, hairy texture on their stems and leaves, which contributes to their common name.</p>
<p>They are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value or used in traditional medicine.</p>
