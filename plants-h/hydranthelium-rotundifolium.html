                    <h1>Hydranthelium rotundifolium</h1>
<p>Hydranthelium rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leaf hydranthelium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, rounded leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pale blue and violet, which bloom during the short growing season. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and requires full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
