<p>Helianthemum viscidulum subsp.</p>
<p>viscarioides, commonly known as the sticky rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, typically on stems covered in fine, sticky hairs.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its leaves are generally elliptical and covered with a waxy, glandular coating that gives it a sticky texture.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in coastal and inland regions, where it contributes to the local flora's resilience in arid conditions.</p>
