                    <h1>Hakea pateana</h1>
<p>Hakea pateana, commonly known as the Patean hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical branches and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces woody, cone-like structures that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Hakea pateana is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a common feature of coastal heathlands.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitat.</p>
