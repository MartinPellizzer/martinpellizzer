                    <h1>Heliamphora ceracea</h1>
<p>Heliamphora ceracea, commonly known as the pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the tepuis of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant's unique morphology includes a narrow neck and a wide, funnel-like opening that helps in capturing prey. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires high humidity and indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Heliamphora ceracea plays an important ecological role in its habitat by controlling insect populations and contributing to the local biodiversity.</p>
