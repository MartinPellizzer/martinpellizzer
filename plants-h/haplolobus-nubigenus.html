<p>Haplolobus nubigenus, commonly known as the cloud-like lichen, is a unique foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leaf-like thallus that often appears fluffy or cloud-like in texture. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, which contribute to its ability to photosynthesize and absorb nutrients. It typically grows on tree bark, rocks, or soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its fragile structure, it is sensitive to environmental changes and serves as an indicator of air quality.</p>
