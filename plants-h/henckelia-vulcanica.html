                    <h1>Henckelia vulcanica</h1>
<p>Henckelia vulcanica, commonly known as the volcanic heather, is a flowering plant native to the volcanic regions of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of volcanic terrain. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Henckelia vulcanica is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to its extreme environment.</p>
