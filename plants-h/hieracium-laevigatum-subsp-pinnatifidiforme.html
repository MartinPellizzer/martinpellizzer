<p>Hieracium laevigatum subsp.</p>
<p>pinnatifidiforme, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb with a creeping rhizome and hairy stems that often form dense mats.</p>
<p>The leaves are alternate, lanceolate, and typically have a finely toothed or lobed margin. Its yellow flowers are borne in clusters and are similar in appearance to other hawkweed species.</p>
<p>This subspecies is characterized by its slender, pinnatifid (deeply divided) leaves, which distinguish it from other members of the genus.</p>
