                    <h1>Heliophila filiformis</h1>
<p>Heliophila filiformis, commonly known as the slender heliophyte, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves and small, clustered white or pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, preferring full sun exposure. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Heliophila filiformis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich aquatic environments.</p>
