<p>Helianthemum nummularium subsp.</p>
<p>tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly sandmat, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, rounded, silver-gray leaves covered in a dense layer of fine, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for Mediterranean-style landscapes.</p>
