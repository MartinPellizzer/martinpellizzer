                    <h1>Hydnophytum puffii</h1>
<p>Hydnophytum puffii, commonly known as the sticky bryophyte, is a unique epiphytic plant that forms symbiotic relationships with specific mosses.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small invertebrates, which it then absorbs through its leaves. The plant is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its morphology includes a short stem with dense clusters of leaves and specialized structures for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Hydnophytum puffii plays a role in nutrient cycling in its ecosystem due to its unique feeding mechanism.</p>
