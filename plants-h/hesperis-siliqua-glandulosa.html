<p>Hesperis siliqua-glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular silique houstonia, is a member of the Brassicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical seed pods called siliques, which are covered in glandular hairs.
