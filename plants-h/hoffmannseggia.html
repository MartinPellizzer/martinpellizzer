<p>Hoffmannseggia, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cactaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to the arid regions of the Americas, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. They are characterized by their succulent stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are usually small, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette pattern to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Hoffmannseggia species are adapted to hot, dry environments and are often used in xeriscaping due to their low water requirements.</p>
