                    <h1>Hymenopappus integer</h1>
<p>Hymenopappus integer, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its root system is deep and taprooted, allowing it to access underground water sources.</p>
<p>Hymenopappus integer is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
