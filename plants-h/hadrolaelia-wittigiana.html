<p>Hadrolaelia wittigiana, commonly known as the Wittigiana orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the Andean regions of South America, where it thrives in high-altitude, cool, and humid environments. The plant features a short, stocky rhizome with a few leaves and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and purple. Its blooms are typically small and clustered, often appearing in late summer or early autumn.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
