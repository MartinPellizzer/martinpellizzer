<p>Hieracium glaciale subsp.</p>
<p>holotiltum, commonly known as the glacier hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant has finely divided, silver-gray leaves that are adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of alpine ecosystems.</p>
