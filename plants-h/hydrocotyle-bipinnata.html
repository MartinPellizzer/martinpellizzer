                    <h1>Hydrocotyle bipinnata</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle bipinnata, commonly known as the water pennywort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, arrowhead-shaped leaves that float on the water surface or grow submerged. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle bipinnata plays a role in stabilizing water ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
