                    <h1>Hemisphaera radchensis</h1>
<p>Hemisphaera radchensis, commonly known as the red sandstone lichen, is a unique species of lichen that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive hemispherical thallus, which gives it its scientific name. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, allowing it to survive in harsh, nutrient-poor soils. It is often found on rock surfaces, particularly in regions with low humidity and high solar exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, Hemisphaera radchensis is considered an indicator species for environmental stability and desert ecosystems.</p>
