                    <h1>Heliotropium murinum</h1>
<p>Heliotropium murinum, commonly known as the stinkweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces pink or purple flowers that open in the morning and close at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty. Its leaves are alternate and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Heliotropium murinum is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in coastal areas due to its salt tolerance.</p>
