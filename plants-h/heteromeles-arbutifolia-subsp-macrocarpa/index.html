                            <h1>Heteromeles Arbutifolia Subsp. Macrocarpa</h1>
<p>Coffeeberry, scientifically known as Heteromeles arbutifolia subsp. macrocarpa, is a unique evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of Southern California. It is characterized by its glossy dark green leaves and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces bright red, berry-like fruits that attract a variety of wildlife, including birds and mammals. Despite its ornamental value, it is often mistaken for a true berry due to its appearance and taste. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native habitat.</p>
