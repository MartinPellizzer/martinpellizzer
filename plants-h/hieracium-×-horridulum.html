<p>Hieracium × horridulum, commonly known as the rough hawkweed, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, often spiny stems and leaves, which contribute to its rugged appearance. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that are typically arranged in a flat-topped cluster. It is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, often growing in disturbed soils and open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain environments.</p>
