                    <h1>Habenaria hayatana</h1>
<p>Habenaria hayatana, commonly known as the Malayan butterfly orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The plant produces delicate, butterfly-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, which are highly attractive to pollinators. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the forest floor.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions.</p>
