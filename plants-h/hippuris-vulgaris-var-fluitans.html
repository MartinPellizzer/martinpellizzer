                    <h1>Hippuris vulgaris var. fluitans</h1>
<p>Hippuris vulgaris var. fluitans, commonly known as water parsnip, is a semi-aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive arrowhead-shaped leaf that floats on the water surface, with a long, narrow petiole that supports it. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, and its root system is adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils. It is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its aromatic, carrot-like scent when crushed, which is due to the presence of volatile compounds.</p>
