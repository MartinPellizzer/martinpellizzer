<p>Hieracium murorum subsp.</p>
<p>liljeholmii, commonly known as the Swedish sandweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer.</p>
<p>The subspecies is native to parts of Scandinavia, particularly Sweden and Norway, where it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. It has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>This plant plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
