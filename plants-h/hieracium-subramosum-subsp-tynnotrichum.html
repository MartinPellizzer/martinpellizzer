<p>Hieracium subramosum subsp.</p>
<p>tynnotrichum, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its upright, branching stems and yellowish to reddish flowers.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, hairy structures, which help reduce water loss in its often arid or semi-arid habitats. It produces small, composite flowers that develop into seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
