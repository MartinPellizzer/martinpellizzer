                    <h1>Holopogon japonicus</h1>
<p>Holopogon japonicus, commonly known as the Japanese sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Holopogon japonicus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water.</p>
