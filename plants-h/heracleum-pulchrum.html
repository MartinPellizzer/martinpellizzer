                    <h1>Heracleum pulchrum</h1>
<p>Heracleum pulchrum, commonly known as the beautiful hogweed, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, umbrella-like compound leaves.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by oval, dry fruits.</p>
<p>It is important to note that while not as toxic as its relative, giant hogweed, it can still cause skin irritation upon contact with its sap.</p>
