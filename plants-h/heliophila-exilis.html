<p>Heliophila exilis, commonly known as slender heliophyte, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marshy environments in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, with slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves.
