<p>Halenia, commonly known as the "water plantain," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Alismataceae.</p>
<p>It typically features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in clusters. These plants are aquatic or semi-aquatic, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams.
