<p>Hieracium brachiatum subsp.</p>
<p>pinetorum, commonly known as the pine forest hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the pine forests of Europe. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats within pine woodlands, often on well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The plant has basal leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, with a rough, hairy texture. Its yellow flowers are borne in dense, flat-topped clusters, and it produces small, ovoid seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to the specific ecological conditions of its native range, making it an important component of its forest ecosystem.</p>
