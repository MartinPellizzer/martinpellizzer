                    <h1>Herniaria hirsuta var. pauciflora</h1>
<p>Herniaria hirsuta var. pauciflora, commonly known as the hairy herniaria, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, greenish-white leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to its role in pollination in its native habitats. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra or mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it well-adapted to cold climates and poor soil conditions.</p>
