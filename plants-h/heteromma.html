                    <h1>Heteromma</h1>
<p>Heteromma, commonly known as the green lacewing, is a genus of insects belonging to the family Hemerobiusidae.</p>
<p>These insects are characterized by their delicate, lace-like wings and elongated bodies. They are often found in moist environments such as marshes and gardens. Heteromma species play a role in ecological balance by preying on small invertebrates.</p>
<p>Their botanical significance lies in their habitat preferences and their contribution to natural pest control in plant ecosystems.</p>
