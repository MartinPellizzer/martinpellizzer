<p>It is characterized by its delicate, slender stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forest understories. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The orchid's botanical structure reflects its adaptation to humid, low-light environments.</p>
