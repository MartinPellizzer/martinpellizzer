<p>Huernia campanulata, commonly known as the bell-shaped African hatplant, is a succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a red or purple throat. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections.</p>
