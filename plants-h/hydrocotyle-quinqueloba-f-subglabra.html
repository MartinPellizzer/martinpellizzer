                    <h1>Hydrocotyle quinqueloba f. subglabra</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle quinqueloba f. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth five-lobed water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of shiny, oval leaves with five distinct lobes, and the leaves are typically smooth and hairless, giving it its subspecies name "subglabra.". The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the summer months. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, stream banks, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure makes it well adapted to waterlogged conditions, with a shallow root system that helps stabilize the soil.</p>
