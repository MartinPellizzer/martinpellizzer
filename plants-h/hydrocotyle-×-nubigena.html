                    <h1>Hydrocotyle × nubigena</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle × nubigena, commonly known as the floating pennywort, is a hybrid aquatic plant that thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It features rounded, waxy leaves that float on the water surface, with smaller, submerged leaves below. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically borne in clusters. Its rapid growth rate makes it an invasive species in many regions, often outcompeting native plants.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is characterized by its ability to reproduce both sexually and vegetatively, contributing to its spread and ecological impact.</p>
