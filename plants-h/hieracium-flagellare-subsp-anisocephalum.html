<p>Hieracium flagellare subsp.</p>
<p>anisocephalum, commonly known as the variable hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosettes of leaves, which are typically lanceolate in shape.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow composite flowers that are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the daisy family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grassy habitats and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its variability in leaf and flower morphology, it is sometimes challenging to distinguish from closely related species.</p>
