<p>Hieracium platessifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in a single head, which are surrounded by bracts and are often visited by pollinators such as bees. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
