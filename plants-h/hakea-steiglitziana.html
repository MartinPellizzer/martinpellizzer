<p>Hakea steiglitziana, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and clusters of bright red or orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in dry conditions. It produces woody, cone-like fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>Hakea steiglitziana is often found in heathlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.</p>
