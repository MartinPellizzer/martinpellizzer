                    <h1>Heterocentron oerstedii</h1>
<p>Heterocentron oerstedii, commonly known as the Oersted's water fern, is a aquatic fern native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating, delicate fronds that are typically divided into small, narrow segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Heterocentron oerstedii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and shelter for small aquatic organisms.</p>
