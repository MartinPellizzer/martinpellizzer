<p>Hymenophyllum decurrens, commonly known as the running brake fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the moist forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery, and often hairy fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>
