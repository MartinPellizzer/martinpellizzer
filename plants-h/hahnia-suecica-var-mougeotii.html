<p>Hahnia suecica var. mougeotii, commonly known as the Swedish hahnia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Scandinavia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
