<p>Helianthemum alyssoides var. ambiguum, commonly known as the creeping sunrose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wool, which helps to reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for Mediterranean-style gardens.</p>
