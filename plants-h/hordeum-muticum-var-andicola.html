                    <h1>Hordeum muticum var. andicola</h1>
<p>[WRONG START] Hordeem muticum var. andicola, commonly known as the Andean wild barley, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, glabrous leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with two to three spikelets, each containing two to three flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils, making it a common species in alpine and paramo ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject in studies of plant adaptation and genetic diversity in high-altitude regions.</p>
