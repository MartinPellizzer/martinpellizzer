<p>Hieracium glaucinum subsp.</p>
<p>subfraternum, commonly known as the glaucous hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, yellowish-green leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Native to Europe, this subspecies thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. The plant has a creeping growth habit with stolons that help it spread across the ground.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a common sight in temperate regions, though it is often considered a weed due to its invasive tendencies.</p>
