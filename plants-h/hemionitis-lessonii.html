<p>Hemionitis lessonii, commonly known as the rock fern, is a unique aquatic fern native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands, often growing on rocks or submerged substrates. Its fronds are typically narrow and strap-like, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sori on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Hemionitis lessonii is notable for its ability to tolerate both aquatic and terrestrial conditions, making it an adaptable and resilient species.</p>
