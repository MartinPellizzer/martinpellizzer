<p>Hieracium porrifolium subsp.</p>
<p>porrifolium, commonly known as the meadow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and flowering stems that bear yellow disk flowers surrounded by pale yellow to white ray florets.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist meadows, pastures, and along streambanks, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are often mistaken for those of other hawkweed species due to similar morphology, but the subspecies is distinguished by its more robust growth and specific habitat preferences.</p>
<p>It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
