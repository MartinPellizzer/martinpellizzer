<p>Hypericum perfoliatum var. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has succulent, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and slightly hairy, with a reddish or purple hue on the underside.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its compact growth habit.</p>
