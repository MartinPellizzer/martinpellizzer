                    <h1>Hemionitis angulosa</h1>
<p>Hemionitis angulosa, commonly known as the angular hemionitis, is a rare and specialized fern found in specific alpine and arctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, angular fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in moist, rocky habitats and is often found in association with other cold-adapted flora. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, Hemionitis angulosa is considered an indicator species for high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
