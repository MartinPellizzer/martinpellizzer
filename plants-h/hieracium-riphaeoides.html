                    <h1>Hieracium riphaeoides</h1>
<p>Hieracium riphaeoides, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky areas, thriving in cold, high-altitude environments. The plant has basal leaves that are often woolly and covered in fine hairs, while its flowering stems bear yellow flower heads composed of many small florets. It produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal, aiding in its spread across mountainous terrain.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a rare and sensitive indicator species of alpine ecosystems.</p>
