                    <h1>Hevea membranacea</h1>
<p>Hevea membranacea, commonly known as the rubber vine, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its climbing habit and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Its latex, similar to that of the rubber tree, has been historically used for various industrial purposes.</p>
<p>However, it is less commercially significant than other rubber-producing species.</p>
