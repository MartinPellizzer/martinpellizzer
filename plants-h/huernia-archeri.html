<p>Huernia archeri, commonly known as the "Lion's Tail" or "Coral Cactus," is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branching structure with fleshy, ribbed stems that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Huernia archeri is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its low maintenance and unique appearance.</p>
