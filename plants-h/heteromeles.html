<p>Heteromeles, commonly known as the toyon, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to California and parts of Oregon.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces bright red berries that are edible for birds and mammals but are generally not palatable to humans. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture, and it often grows in chaparral and coastal sage scrub habitats.</p>
<p>Heteromeles is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife.</p>
