                    <h1>Halocnemum moniliforme</h1>
<p>Halocnemum moniliforme, commonly known as the sea spurge, is a halophyte native to arid and saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in coastal areas and salt marshes, where it tolerates high salinity and low water availability. Its leaves are reduced to scales, and it produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds.</p>
<p>Halocnemum moniliforme plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and is often found in Mediterranean and Middle Eastern regions.</p>
