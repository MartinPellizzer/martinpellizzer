<p>Hemestheum oreopteris var. platylobum, commonly known as the flat-lobed mountain holly, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with dark green, leathery leaves that have a distinctive flat, broad lobed shape. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland habitats, often on rocky or acidic soils. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
