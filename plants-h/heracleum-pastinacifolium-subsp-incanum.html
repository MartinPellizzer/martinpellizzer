<p>Heracleum pastinacifolium subsp.</p>
<p>incanum, commonly known as the hairy cow parsnip, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, palmately lobed leaves that are covered in fine, hairy textures.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its resemblance to toxic plants like poison hemlock, it requires careful identification to avoid misidentification.</p>
