                    <h1>Hydrilla subulata</h1>
<p>Hydrilla subulata, commonly known as the slender hydrilla, is a submerged aquatic plant native to Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. Hydrilla subulata thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth rate makes it both an important component of aquatic ecosystems and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats.</p>
