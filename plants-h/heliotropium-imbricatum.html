<p>Heliotropium imbricatum, commonly known as the beach heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often resembling those of the common heliotrope. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. Its leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
