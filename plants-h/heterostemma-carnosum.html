                    <h1>Heterostemma carnosum</h1>
<p>Heterostemma carnosum, commonly known as the fleshy-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It possesses fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are typically thick and waxy, adaptations that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers, followed by berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its roots form haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, Heterostemma carnosum plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and contributing to biodiversity.</p>
