<p>Hedera helix subsp.</p>
<p>canariensis, commonly known as the Canary island ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to the Canary Islands. It features dark green, leathery leaves that are typically broader and more elongated compared to other ivy species.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in non-native regions.</p>
