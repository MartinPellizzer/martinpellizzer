<p>Hieracium fruticulescens, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces yellow flowers with ray florets. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are typically lance-shaped and serrated. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Hieracium fruticulescens is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
