                    <h1>Hylotelephium mongolicum</h1>
<p>Hylotelephium mongolicum, commonly known as Mongolian stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and rocky environments. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink and red during the summer months. It is often used in rock gardens due to its low maintenance and ornamental value.</p>
<p>Hylotelephium mongolicum is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas.</p>
