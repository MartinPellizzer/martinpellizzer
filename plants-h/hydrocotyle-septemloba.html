<p>Hydrocotyle septemloba, commonly known as the seven-lobed water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of heart-shaped, smooth, and often waxy leaves that are typically green with a light-colored midrib. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in summer, adding ornamental value to aquatic or moist garden settings. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in shallow water or along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle septemloba is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
