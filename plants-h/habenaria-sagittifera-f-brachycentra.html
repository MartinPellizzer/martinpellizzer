                    <h1>Habenaria sagittifera f. brachycentra</h1>
<p>Habenaria sagittifera f. brachycentra, commonly known as the short-stalked arrowroot orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically pollinated by specific insect species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in primary forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this orchid is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
