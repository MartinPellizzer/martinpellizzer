<p>Homalanthus polyandrus, commonly known as the African fevervine, is a climbing shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive, three-lobed seed capsules. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some regions.</p>
