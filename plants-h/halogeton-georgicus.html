<p>Halogeton georgicus, commonly known as the desert saltbush, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, which helps it store water and survive in drought conditions.</p>
<p>Halogeton georgicus is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
