                    <h1>Hymenophyllum franklinianum</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum franklinianum, commonly known as the Franklin's spore moss, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, delicate plant with narrow, elongated leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The leaves are usually bright green and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid, shaded habitats. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas, often growing on tree trunks or stones.</p>
<p>The plant's spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the leaves.</p>
