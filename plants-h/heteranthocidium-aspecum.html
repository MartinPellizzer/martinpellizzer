                    <h1>Heteranthocidium aspecum</h1>
<p>Heteranthocidium aspecum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, slender roots and produces delicate, white flowers with a unique, ghost-like appearance. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in the canopy of old-growth forests.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and threats from habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many areas.</p>
