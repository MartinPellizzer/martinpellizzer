<p>Hoodia whitesloaneana, commonly known as the desert cactus or hoodia, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its branching stems and small, spineless leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow or green flowers, which are typically short-lived and open during the day. Hoodia whitesloaneana is adapted to extreme drought conditions, storing water in its fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and resilience make it an important species in its native ecosystem.</p>
