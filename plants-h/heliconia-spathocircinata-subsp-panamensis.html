<p>Heliconia spathocircinata subsp.</p>
<p>panamensis, commonly known as the Panama heliconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, brightly colored bracts that resemble petals, which are used to attract pollinators.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers inside the bracts, which are typically visited by hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests and along riverbanks.</p>
