<p>Heterotrichum lucidum, commonly known as the shining moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a cryptogamic plant that lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having structures called thalli. This moss thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its foliage is dense and compact, with a shiny, bright green appearance that gives it its common name.</p>
<p>Heterotrichum lucidum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
