                    <h1>Helipterum incanum var. alpinum</h1>
<p>Helipterum incanum var. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine helipterum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in high-altitude environments, characterized by its low-growing habit and dense foliage. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are usually pink or white, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh, cold habitat.</p>
<p>This variant is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes.</p>
