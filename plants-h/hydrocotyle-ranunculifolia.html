                    <h1>Hydrocotyle ranunculifolia</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle ranunculifolia, commonly known as the water pennywort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and has a rosette of small, waxy, arrowhead-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle ranunculifolia plays a role in stabilizing aquatic sediments and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
