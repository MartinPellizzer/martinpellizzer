<p>Habenaria paranaensis, commonly known as the Parana Orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are often epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil, and it requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts.</p>
