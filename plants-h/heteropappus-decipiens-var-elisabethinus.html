                    <h1>Heteropappus decipiens var. elisabethinus</h1>
<p>Heteropappus decipiens var. elisabethinus, commonly known as the Elizabeth's false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, woolly leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, bracteate involucres and pappus structures that aid in wind dispersal of its seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open plains.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone conditions.</p>
