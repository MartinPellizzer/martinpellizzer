<p>Heracleum transsilvanicum, commonly known as the Transylvanian cow parsnip, is a tall, herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its hollow, aromatic stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbrella-like inflorescences, typical of the carrot family. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>However, it can be toxic if ingested in large quantities, so caution is advised.</p>
