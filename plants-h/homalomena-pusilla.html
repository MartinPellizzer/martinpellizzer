<p>Homalomena pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf swamp arrowhead, is a small, herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet, shady environments such as marshes and along stream banks. The plant has heart-shaped, arrowhead-like leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often emerging from the water or moist soil.</p>
<p>Due to its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat, it is often cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant in humid conditions.</p>
