<p>Southern halesia, scientifically known as Halesia meehanii, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is prized for its elegant, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Its unique appearance and ecological importance make it a valuable addition to native landscapes. Despite its beauty, it remains relatively uncommon in cultivation.</p>
