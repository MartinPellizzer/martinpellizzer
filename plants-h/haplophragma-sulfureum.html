                    <h1>Haplophragma sulfureum</h1>
<p>Haplophragma sulfureum, commonly known as the sulfur yellow lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant yellow to orange coloration, which comes from the presence of specific pigments. The thallus consists of a layered structure with a distinct upper cortex, algal layer, and lower medulla. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate forests.</p>
<p>This lichen plays a role in nutrient cycling and serves as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollutants.</p>
