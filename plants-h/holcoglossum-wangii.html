<p>Holcoglossum wangii, commonly known as the golden humphead orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves and showy, golden-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocks in cloud forests. Its floral structure is notable for its spurred lip, which is a key feature in orchid taxonomy.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
