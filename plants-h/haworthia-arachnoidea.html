                    <h1>Haworthia arachnoidea</h1>
<p>Haworthia arachnoidea, commonly known as the spider plant or zigzag Haworthia, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the tips. The leaves are covered in a fine, white powdery coating called a cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, greenish-white flowers on tall, slender stalks during the spring or summer.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
