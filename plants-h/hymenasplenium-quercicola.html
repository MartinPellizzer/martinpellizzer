<p>Hymenasplenium quercicola, commonly known as the oak spleenwort, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a cryptogamic plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically on the bark of oak trees. The plant exhibits a thalloid structure with a leafy, lobed thallus that is often covered in a layer of moss-like growth. It plays a role in the ecological dynamics of forest floors by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing microhabitats for other organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in temperate regions with dense canopy cover.</p>
