                    <h1>Holoschoenus romanus var. australis</h1>
<p>Holoschoenus romanus var. australis, commonly known as the Australian flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland and swampy habitats, often forming dense, grass-like colonies. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively and stabilize soil in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in maintaining wetland biodiversity and water quality.</p>
