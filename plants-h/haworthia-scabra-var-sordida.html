                    <h1>Haworthia scabra var. sordida</h1>
<p>Haworthia scabra var. sordida, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves with a distinctive zebra-like pattern of light and dark green stripes. The leaves are typically covered in a layer of fine, white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the cooler months.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance.</p>
