                    <h1>Hoppia</h1>
<p>Hoppia, commonly known as the wild lettuce, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to various regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa, often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head. Its latex contains compounds similar to those found in opium poppies, which have historically been used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>However, due to its potential for misuse, it is now classified as a controlled substance in many countries.</p>
