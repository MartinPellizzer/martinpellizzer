<p>Hairy hawkweed, scientifically known as Hieracium pachysphaericum, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive hairy leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. This species is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils where it thrives in sunny conditions. While it is not considered invasive in its native range, it can sometimes be mistaken for other hawkweed species due to its similar appearance. Its unique features make it a subject of interest for botanists and nature enthusiasts alike.</p>
