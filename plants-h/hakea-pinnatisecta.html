<p>Hakea pinnatisecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often arranged in a pinnatisect pattern, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>Hakea pinnatisecta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and flowering display.</p>
