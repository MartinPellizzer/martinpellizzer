<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune or coastal scrub habitats. Hancea kingii is adapted to withstand saline and wind conditions typical of its coastal environment.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
