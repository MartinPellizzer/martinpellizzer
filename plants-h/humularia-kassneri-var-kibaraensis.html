                    <h1>Humularia kassneri var. kibaraensis</h1>
<p>Humularia kassneri var. kibaraensis, commonly known as the Kibara lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen species that thrives in humid, shaded forest environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its dense, foliose thallus with a greenish to yellowish hue. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to efficiently absorb nutrients from its substrate. It is typically found on tree bark and rocks in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health.</p>
