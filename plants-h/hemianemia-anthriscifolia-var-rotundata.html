                    <h1>Hemianemia anthriscifolia var. rotundata</h1>
<p>Hemianemia anthriscifolia var. rotundata, commonly known as the round-leaved hemianthus, is a variant of the hemianthus genus within the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rounded, lobed leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, a common floral arrangement in the carrot family. It is native to parts of Europe and prefers moist, shady habitats such as woodlands and stream sides.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies in plant morphology and ecological adaptation.</p>
