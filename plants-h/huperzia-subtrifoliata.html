<p>Huperzia subtrifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaved clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporophyte produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in strobila.</p>
<p>Huperzia subtrifoliata is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its role in ecological systems and traditional medicine.</p>
