<p>Hieracium alatum subsp.</p>
<p>subolivaceum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, rough stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in leaf and stem structure.</p>
