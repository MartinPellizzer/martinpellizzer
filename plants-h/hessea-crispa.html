                    <h1>Hessea crispa</h1>
<p>Hessea crispa, commonly known as the coastal dune lichen, is a unique plant that thrives in harsh coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is a lichen, which means it is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. Hessea crispa is adapted to withstand salt spray, strong winds, and nutrient-poor soils. Its morphology includes a crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to the substrate.</p>
<p>This plant plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy dunes and preventing erosion in coastal ecosystems.</p>
