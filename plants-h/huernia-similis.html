                    <h1>Huernia similis</h1>
<p>Huernia similis, commonly known as the horned ice plant, is a succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems that are often covered in spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are reduced to tubercles, and it stores water in its stem for survival during droughts.</p>
<p>Huernia similis is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and unique appearance.</p>
