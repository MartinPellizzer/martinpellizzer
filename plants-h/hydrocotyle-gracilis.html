<p>Hydrocotyle gracilis, commonly known as slender water pennywort, is a semi-aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in ponds, streams, and marshes. The plant has small, heart-shaped leaves that are usually floating or just partially submerged. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters, and it produces tiny, dark seeds.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle gracilis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
