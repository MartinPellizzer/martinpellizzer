                            <h1>Hepetis Sulphurea</h1>
<p>Sulphur buttercup, scientifically known as Hepetis sulphurea, is a strikingly colorful wildflower native to parts of Europe and Asia. Its bright yellow petals and distinctive shape make it a standout in meadows and grasslands. Despite its beauty, it is often mistaken for other buttercup species due to its similar appearance. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in open habitats. Its ecological importance includes supporting pollinators and contributing to biodiversity in its native regions.</p>
