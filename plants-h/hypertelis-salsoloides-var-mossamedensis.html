<p>Hypertelis salsoloides var. mossamedensis, commonly known as the Mossamedes saltbush, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and arid environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and saline soils, exhibiting a low, spreading growth habit. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it is well-suited for revegetation in degraded lands.</p>
<p>This variant is native to southern Africa, particularly Namibia and Angola.</p>
