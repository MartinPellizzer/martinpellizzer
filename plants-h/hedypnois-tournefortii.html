                    <h1>Hedypnois tournefortii</h1>
<p>Hedypnois tournefortii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub with gray-green, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, rounded fruits that are dispersed by wind. Hedypnois tournefortii is adapted to survive in poor soils and can tolerate extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological resilience make it an important species in its native habitat.</p>
