                    <h1>Haworthiopsis × rubrobrunnea</h1>
<p>Haworthiopsis × rubrobrunnea, commonly known as the firecrest or red-brown haworthia, is a hybrid succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically a mix of green, red, and brown hues. The leaves are covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers on slender stems during the warmer months.</p>
<p>This plant is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal.</p>
