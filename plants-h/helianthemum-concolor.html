                    <h1>Helianthemum concolor</h1>
<p>Helianthemum concolor, commonly known as the smooth stonecrop, is a low-growing evergreen succulent native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, adding a bright contrast to its foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
