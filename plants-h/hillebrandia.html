                    <h1>Hillebrandia</h1>
<p>Hillebrandia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Hillebrandia species typically have long, slender roots and possess striking, showy flowers with a unique structure that resembles a ghostly face. The plant is highly sensitive to environmental changes, making it a challenging species to cultivate.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its ecological role and its status as a symbol of tropical biodiversity.</p>
