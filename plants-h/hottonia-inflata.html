                    <h1>Hottonia inflata</h1>
<p>Hottonia inflata, commonly known as the inflated bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often submerged, while the specialized bladders are found at the water's surface.</p>
<p>H. inflata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
