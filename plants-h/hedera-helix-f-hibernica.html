<p>Hedera helix f. hibernica, commonly known as the Irish ivy, is a compact, trailing evergreen vine native to western Europe.</p>

It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in late summer, followed by dark blue berries that are attractive to birds.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and low maintenance, it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
