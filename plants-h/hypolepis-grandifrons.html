<p>Hypolepis grandifrons, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water bodies. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to colonize wetlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteridaceae family.</p>
