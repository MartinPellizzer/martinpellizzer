                    <h1>Hedera helix var. walthamensis</h1>
<p>Hedera helix var. walthamensis, commonly known as the Waltham ivy, is a variant of the common English ivy.</p>
<p>It is a climbing evergreen vine characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are typically heart-shaped with a wavy margin. This variety is native to the United Kingdom and thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for ground cover or as a climbing plant in gardens.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pale yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries, though it is more valued for its ornamental foliage than its fruit.</p>
