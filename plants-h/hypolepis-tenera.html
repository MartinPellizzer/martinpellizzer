<p>Hypolepis tenera, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through its habitat.</p>
<p>The leaves are evergreen, and the plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of the fronds.</p>
