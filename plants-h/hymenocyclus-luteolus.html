                    <h1>Hymenocyclus luteolus</h1>
<p>Hymenocyclus luteolus, commonly known as the yellow-eyed cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often a deep green. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being yellow and the female cones being reddish-brown, which is a distinguishing feature. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections.</p>
