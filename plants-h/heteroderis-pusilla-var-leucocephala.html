                    <h1>Heteroderis pusilla var. leucocephala</h1>
<p>Heteroderis pusilla var. leucocephala, commonly known as the white-headed pinworm, is a parasitic nematode rather than a botanical plant, so it does not have traditional botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Tylenchidae and is known for its ability to infect plant roots, causing significant damage to crops. The species is characterized by its small size and distinctive white head, which is a key identifying feature. It thrives in soil and is often found in agricultural areas where its host plants are cultivated.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a role in soil ecosystems but is generally considered a pest in agricultural settings.</p>
