                    <h1>Hierochloe borealis var. biflora</h1>
<p>Hierochloe borealis var. biflora, commonly known as the Arctic hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to cold regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like colonies and has slender, wiry stems that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and arctic tundra environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-adapted to harsh, cold climates with short growing seasons.</p>
