<p>Hibiscadelphus wilderianus, commonly known as the Haleakalā hibiscus, is a rare endemic plant found exclusively on the island of Maui in Hawaii.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within the volcanic rock formations of Haleakalā National Park. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat loss, it is classified as critically endangered.</p>
