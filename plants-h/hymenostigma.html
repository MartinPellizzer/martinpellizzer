                    <h1>Hymenostigma</h1>
<p>Hymenostigma, commonly known as the "sac-like fern," is a genus of small, terrestrial ferns belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their delicate, finely divided leaves and their preference for moist, shaded environments. Hymenostigma species typically have a compact growth form with rhizomes that produce numerous tiny, scale-like fronds. The spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are often protected by a specialized, sac-like covering, which is a key feature of the genus.</p>
<p>These plants are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where they thrive in humid, shaded habitats.</p>
