                    <h1>Hymenophyllum neesii var. aculeatum</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum neesii var. aculeatum, commonly known as the aculeate fern, is a small, delicate epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a small, kidney-shaped indusium.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its unique morphology and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in tropical gardens.</p>
