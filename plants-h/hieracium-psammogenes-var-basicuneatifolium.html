                    <h1>Hieracium psammogenes var. basicuneatifolium</h1>
<p>Hieracium psammogenes var. basicuneatifolium, commonly known as the sand dune hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is adapted to thrive in sandy, coastal environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a rough texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in disturbed soils and is a common species in dune ecosystems.</p>
