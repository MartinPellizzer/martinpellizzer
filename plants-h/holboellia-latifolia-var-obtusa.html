<p>Holboellia latifolia var. obtusa, commonly known as the broadleaf holboellia, is a perennial herb native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which bloom during the wet season. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine.</p>
