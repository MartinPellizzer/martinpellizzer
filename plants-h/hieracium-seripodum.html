<p>Hieracium seripodum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features hairy, rough-textured leaves and produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often spreading through rhizomes.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
