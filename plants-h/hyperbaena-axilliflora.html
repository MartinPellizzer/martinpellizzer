<p>Hyperbaena axilliflora, commonly known as the coastal hyperbaena, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in areas exposed to salt spray. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Hyperbaena axilliflora is well-suited to coastal environments due to its tolerance of saline conditions and strong winds.</p>
