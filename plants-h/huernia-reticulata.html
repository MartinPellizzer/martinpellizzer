                    <h1>Huernia reticulata</h1>
<p>Huernia reticulata, commonly known as the netted horned frog or netted star cactus, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming during the warmer months. Its leaves are usually modified into spines, which help protect it from herbivores and reduce transpiration.</p>
<p>Huernia reticulata is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil to thrive.</p>
