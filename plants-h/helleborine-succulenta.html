<p>Helleborine succulenta, commonly known as the succulent helleborine, is a member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Native to certain regions of Africa and the Middle East, it thrives in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens.</p>
