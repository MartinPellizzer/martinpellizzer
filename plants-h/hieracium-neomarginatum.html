<p>Hieracium neomarginatum, commonly known as the New Zealand hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as grasslands and riverbanks. It has hairy stems and leaves with a serrated edge, and its yellow flowers bloom in clusters.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in areas outside its native range.</p>
