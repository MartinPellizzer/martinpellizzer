                            <h1>Houstonia Longiflora</h1>
<p>Houstonia longiflora, commonly known as the blue-eyed grass, is a small yet striking flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in moist, woodland environments and is often found in shaded areas with rich, well-drained soil. Despite its delicate appearance, this plant is remarkably resilient and can withstand periods of drought. Its most distinctive feature is its clusters of tiny, sky-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. This plant is not only a beauty of the natural world but also plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and ecosystems.</p>
