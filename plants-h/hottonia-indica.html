                    <h1>Hottonia indica</h1>
<p>Hottonia indica, commonly known as the water clover, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, four-lobed leaves that resemble the shape of a clover, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and wetlands, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its small, white flowers bloom in early spring, adding a subtle ornamental value to its habitat.</p>
<p>Hottonia indica plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing shelter for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water quality through its natural filtration processes.</p>
