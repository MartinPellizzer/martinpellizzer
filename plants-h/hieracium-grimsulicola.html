<p>Hieracium grimsulicola, commonly known as the Grimsulicola hawkweed, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and yellowish to orange-colored flowers. This plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it faces harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Its survival is closely tied to the stability of its alpine ecosystem, making it a valuable indicator of environmental health.</p>
