<p>Heterocarpus fernandezianus, commonly known as the Fernandezian fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the Gal√°pagos Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive fronds, which are long, narrow, and often have a wavy or undulating appearance. The plant exhibits a creeping growth habit, with rhizomes that spread along the ground to form dense mats. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
