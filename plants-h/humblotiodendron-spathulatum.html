                    <h1>Humblotiodendron spathulatum</h1>
<p>Humblotiodendron spathulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that thrives on host trees in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are often consumed by birds, facilitating seed dispersal. Its leaves are typically narrow and elliptical, with a waxy surface that reduces water loss.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in ecosystem dynamics by influencing host tree growth and providing food for wildlife.</p>
