<p>Hieracium tomentatum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white tomentum, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, flat-topped clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Hieracium tomentatum is known for its ornamental value but can also be considered a weed in some agricultural settings.</p>
