                    <h1>Hypoporum</h1>
<p>Hypoporum, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow, buttercup-like flowers that bloom in early spring. Hypoporum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it both a resilient and sometimes invasive species.</p>
