                    <h1>Habenaria arabica</h1>
<p>Habenaria arabica, commonly known as the Arabian marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland and marshy habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soil. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. It is adapted to the arid climate of its native region through specialized root systems that store water.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
