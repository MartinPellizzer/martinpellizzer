                    <h1>Heterocarpus glaber</h1>
<p>Heterocarpus glaber, commonly known as the slender watergrass, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that float on the water surface, with a thick, waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically submerged, followed by the development of distinctive, elongated fruits. Its rhizomes form dense mats that can stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Heterocarpus glaber is often found in slow-moving freshwater environments, where it plays a role in nutrient cycling and water filtration.</p>
