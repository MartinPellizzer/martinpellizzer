<p>Hippomarathrum rigidum, commonly known as the rigid burr, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous, woody stems. The plant produces small, spiny fruits that are adapted for seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Hippomarathrum rigidum is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to Mediterranean-type climates.</p>
