<p>Helichroa crocea, commonly known as the red sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of fleshy, succulent leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange-red, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Its succulent leaves help it store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Helichroa crocea is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in environments with limited rainfall.</p>
