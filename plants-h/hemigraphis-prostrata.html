<p>It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves with a velvety texture and a striking coloration that ranges from silver to deep green. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for ground cover in shaded gardens.</p>
