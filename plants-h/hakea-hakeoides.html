                    <h1>Hakea hakeoides</h1>
<p>Hakea hakeoides, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves and its ability to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>Hakea hakeoides is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
