                            <h1>Hieracium Murorum Subsp. Subserratum</h1>
<p>Hieracium murorum subsp. subserratum is a lesser-known member of the daisy family, known for its distinctive leaf shape and subtle floral display. This subspecies is often found in rocky or disturbed soils, thriving in environments where other plants struggle to grow. Its serrated leaves and small yellow flowers make it a unique addition to local flora. Despite its modest appearance, it plays an important role in supporting pollinators and maintaining ecological balance. Studying this plant offers insights into plant adaptation and biodiversity in challenging habitats.</p>
