<p>Hieronymiella, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of a single species, Hieronymiella thunbergii, which is native to eastern Asia, particularly Japan. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and a tall, slender flowering stem that produces small, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>The genus is named in honor of the botanist Hieronymus Bock, reflecting its historical significance in botanical studies.</p>
