<p>Heteroporidium, commonly known as the umbrella moss, is a genus of liverworts belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-shaped thalli that are often covered in a dense layer of rhizoids. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its structure consists of a central stalk with leaf-like structures radiating outwards, forming a rosette-like appearance.</p>
<p>Heteroporidium plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem.</p>
