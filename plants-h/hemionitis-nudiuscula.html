<p>Hemionitis nudiuscula, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water fern, is a small aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has delicate, thread-like fronds that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Hemionitis nudiuscula plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
