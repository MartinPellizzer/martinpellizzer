<p>Hydrocotyle sundaica, commonly known as the Sunda water shield, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It has finely divided, floating leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in diameter, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by dark, spherical berries. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle sundaica is often used in ornamental water gardens due to its attractive appearance and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
