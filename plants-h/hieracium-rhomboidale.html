                    <h1>Hieracium rhomboidale</h1>
<p>Hieracium rhomboidale, commonly known as the rhomboid hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows to a height of 20â€“60 cm, featuring basal leaves that are rhombic in shape, hence its scientific name. It produces yellow flowers with ray florets and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native flora.</p>
