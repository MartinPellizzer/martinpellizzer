<p>Hydrocotyle masamunei, commonly known as the Philippine water shield, is a aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves that are typically heart-shaped with a waxy surface. The plant produces small white flowers that are clustered in umbels, often emerging from the water's surface. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, allowing it to colonize shallow water bodies.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle masamunei plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
