                    <h1>Hortia neblinensis</h1>
<p>Hortia neblinensis, commonly known as the Neblin's hortia, is a unique plant native to the misty highlands of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and distinctive, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in clusters during the wet season. Hortia neblinensis thrives in cool, humid environments and is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
