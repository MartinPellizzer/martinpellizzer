<p>Helminthostachys zeylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and heavy, hard timber that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by elongated, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
