<p>Habenaria leptobrachiata, commonly known as the slender-armed marsh orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and numerous, small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant typically grows in wet, marshy habitats and is often found in lowland areas with high humidity. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the waterlogged soil, and it plays a role in the ecological balance of its native environment.</p>
<p>The orchid is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
