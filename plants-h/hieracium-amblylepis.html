<p>Hieracium amblylepis, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and western Asia, where it typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. The plant is characterized by its hairy, often reddish stems and basal leaves that are deeply lobed. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and it produces seeds in a distinctive pappus that aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Hieracium amblylepis is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed soils.</p>
