                            <h1>Hieracium Vulgatum Subsp. Aurulentum</h1>
<p>Hieracium vulgatum subsp. aurulentum is a lesser-known member of the daisy family known for its striking yellow flowers. This subspecies thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its name, meaning "king's grass," reflects its historical use in herbal medicine. The plant is often mistaken for other hawkweeds due to its similar appearance. Despite its modest size, it plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance.</p>
