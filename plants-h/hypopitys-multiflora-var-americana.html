<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features dense clusters of scale-like leaves that form a compact, mat-like structure. It produces tiny, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the plant's spores.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other members of the Lycopodiaceae family and exhibits primitive vascular plant characteristics.</p>
