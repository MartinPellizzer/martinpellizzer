                    <h1>Hillia saldanhaei</h1>
<p>Hillia saldanhaei, commonly known as the Salda√±a's hillia, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hillia saldanhaei is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
