<p>Hypolepis forzzae, commonly known as the Brazilian water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread along the water's surface or through shallow water. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Hypolepis forzzae plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling in freshwater habitats.</p>
