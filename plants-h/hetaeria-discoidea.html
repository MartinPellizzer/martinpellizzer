                <h1>Hetaeria discoidea</h1>
<p>Hetaeria discoidea, commonly known as the ghost lichen, is a member of the family Lichenes, characterized by its unique symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a cyanobacterium or green alga.</p>
<p>This plant-like organism thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on bark, rocks, or soil surfaces. Its thallus, or body, is typically crust-like and pale in color, giving it a ghostly appearance. Hetaeria discoidea plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure, it is sensitive to environmental changes, making it an indicator species for ecological health.</p>
