<p>Hypochaeris pinnatifida, commonly known as the slender weed or narrow-leaved buttercup, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas. It has alternate, pinnately lobed leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom from spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant is often considered a weed but has been used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
