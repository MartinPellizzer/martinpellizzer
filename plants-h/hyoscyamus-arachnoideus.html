<p>Hyoscyamus arachnoideus, commonly known as the spiderflower or desert jimsonweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in inflated, balloon-like pods that aid in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Hyoscyamus arachnoideus is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats.</p>
