<p>Hymenogyne glabra subsp.</p>
<p>namaquensis, commonly known as the Namakwa flat sedge, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It typically grows in damp, sandy soils near rivers and wetlands, preferring full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in dense clusters. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous surfaces and is often found in riparian zones.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
