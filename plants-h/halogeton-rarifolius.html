<p>Halogeton rarifolius, commonly known as the sparse-leaved saltbush, is a halophyte native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in saline and drought-prone environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its roots are extensive and can penetrate deep into the soil to access moisture.</p>
<p>Halogeton rarifolius plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
