                    <h1>Haloxylon floridum</h1>
<p>Haloxylon floridum, commonly known as the Florida haloxylon, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is often used in xeriscaping and restoration projects in arid landscapes.</p>
