<p>Hymenophyllum skottsbergii, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, velvety fronds that are covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum skottsbergii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
