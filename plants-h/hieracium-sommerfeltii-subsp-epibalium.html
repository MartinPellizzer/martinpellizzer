<p>Hieracium sommerfeltii subsp.</p>
<p>epibalium, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems.</p>
