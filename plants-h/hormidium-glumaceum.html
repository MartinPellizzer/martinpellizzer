                    <h1>Hormidium glumaceum</h1>
<p>Hormidium glumaceum, commonly known as the spikeless sandmat, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low, mat-forming growth habit and features small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow to green flowers that bloom in early spring. Hormidium glumaceum is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species.</p>
