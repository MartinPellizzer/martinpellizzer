                    <h1>Heracleum sibiricum</h1>
<p>Heracleum sibiricum, commonly known as Siberian cowparsley, is a tall biennial plant native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its hollow, aromatic stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbrella-like clusters called umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>However, it can be toxic if ingested in large quantities, making it a plant to handle with care.</p>
