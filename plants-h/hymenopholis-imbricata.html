<p>Hymenopholis imbricata, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, humid environments, where it can thrive without direct sunlight. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern along the margins of the fronds.</p>
<p>Hymenopholis imbricata is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in maintaining soil stability and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
