                    <h1>Hoffmannseggia viscosa</h1>
<p>Hoffmannseggia viscosa, commonly known as the sticky hoffmannseggia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, spineless stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Hoffmannseggia viscosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its ability to thrive with minimal water and care.</p>
