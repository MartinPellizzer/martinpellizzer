                    <h1>Herniaria glabra var. cyrenaica</h1>
<p>Herniaria glabra var. cyrenaica, commonly known as the desert mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, succulent leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces tiny white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in poor soils make it well adapted to desert conditions.</p>
<p>It is often found in rocky or sandy habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
