                    <h1>Haworthia cooperi var. viridis</h1>
<p>Haworthia cooperi var. viridis, commonly known as the Emerald Jade or Jade Plant, is a compact, evergreen succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of thick, fleshy, dark green leaves with a waxy coating that reflects light, giving it a striking appearance. The leaves are typically short and upright, with a subtle bluish tint when exposed to sunlight. It produces small, bell-shaped white or yellow flowers on slender stems during the summer months.</p>
<p>This plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light.</p>
