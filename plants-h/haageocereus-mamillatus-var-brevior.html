<p>Haageocereus mamillatus var. brevior, commonly known as the short-stemmed night blooming cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus characterized by its short, thick stems and spiny, cylindrical ribs. The plant produces large, white, star-shaped flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>The varietal form brevior distinguishes it by its shorter stem length compared to the typical species.</p>
