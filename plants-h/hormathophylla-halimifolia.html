<p>Hormathophylla halimifolia, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and strong coastal winds. Its leaves are typically narrow and leathery, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Hormathophylla halimifolia plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
