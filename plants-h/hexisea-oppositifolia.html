                    <h1>Hexisea oppositifolia</h1>
<p>Hexisea oppositifolia, commonly known as the opposite-leaved hexisea, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its opposite arrangement of small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
