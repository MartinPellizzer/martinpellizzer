<p>Hypoporum annulare, commonly known as the ringed bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowers are small and usually green or white in color.</p>
<p>Hypoporum annulare is a carnivorous plant that relies on both photosynthesis and the capture of prey for survival.</p>
