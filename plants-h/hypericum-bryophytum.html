<p>Hypericum bryophytum, commonly known as the mossy St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant features small, narrow leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its stems are often covered in a dense layer of moss-like growth, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>Hypericum bryophytum is noted for its medicinal properties, though it is less commonly used than other Hypericum species.</p>
