                    <h1>Heterophyllium</h1>
<p>Heterophyllium, commonly known as the "variable-leaf fern," is a genus of aquatic ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ability to produce two distinct types of leaves, known as heterophyllies, depending on environmental conditions. The submerged leaves are typically narrow and ribbon-like, while the floating leaves are broader and more robust. These plants are often found in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams.</p>
<p>Their unique leaf morphology allows them to adapt to varying light and water conditions, enhancing their survival in diverse aquatic habitats.</p>
