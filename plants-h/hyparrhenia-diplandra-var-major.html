                    <h1>Hyparrhenia diplandra var. major</h1>
<p>Hyparrhenia diplandra var. major, commonly known as African grass or red grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often reddish in color. The plant produces small, pale brown flowers in terminal spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used for erosion control and as a forage crop.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage and ability to form thick mats in suitable conditions.</p>
