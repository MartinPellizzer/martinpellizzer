                    <h1>Holcus lanatus var. triflorus</h1>
<p>Holcus lanatus var. triflorus, commonly known as the three-flowered bluegrass, is a variant of the common bluegrass species.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-green foliage. The plant produces three to five spikelets per node, which is a distinguishing feature from the typical two-flowered form. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in ecological restoration projects.</p>
