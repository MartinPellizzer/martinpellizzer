                    <h1>Haloxylon gracile</h1>
<p>Haloxylon gracile, commonly known as the slender saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is adapted to extreme drought conditions, with small, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its deep root system allows it to access underground water sources.</p>
<p>Haloxylon gracile plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and preventing desertification.</p>
