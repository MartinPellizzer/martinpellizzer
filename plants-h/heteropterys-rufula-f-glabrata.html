<p>Heteropterys rufula f. glabrata, commonly known as the smoothleaf heteropterys, is a botanical variant characterized by its reduced pubescence compared to the typical form.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. The plant features elongated, lanceolate leaves with a smooth texture, and its flowers are typically clustered in inflorescences. It produces capsule fruits containing numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This variant is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphological traits and potential ecological adaptations.</p>
