                    <h1>Hexastylis arifolia var. ruthii</h1>
<p>Hexastylis arifolia var. ruthii, commonly known as the Florida arrowwood, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, which are often hidden among the foliage. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The leaves and stems are often used in traditional medicine, though the plant contains toxic compounds that require careful handling.</p>
