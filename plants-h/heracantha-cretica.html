                    <h1>Heracantha cretica</h1>
<p>Heracantha cretica, commonly known as the Cretan Heracantha, is a rare and elusive plant native to the island of Crete.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, aromatic stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, limestone-rich soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate. Its leaves are finely divided and emit a mild, spicy scent when crushed.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
