                    <h1>Hanghomia</h1>
<p>Hanghomia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its most striking feature is its pale, almost translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has no leaves and relies entirely on its roots for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Hanghomia is considered a conservation concern.</p>
