                    <h1>Huertia</h1>
<p>Huertia, commonly known as stonecrop, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Crassulaceae.</p>
<p>These succulent plants are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are characterized by their fleshy, water-storing leaves. Many species of Huertia have a rosette growth form, which helps them conserve moisture in arid environments. They produce small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, often in the spring or summer.</p>
<p>Huertia species are popular in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to their low maintenance and ornamental value.</p>
