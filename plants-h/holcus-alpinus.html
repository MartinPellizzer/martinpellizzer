<p>Holcus alpinus, commonly known as alpine hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which are usually green or reddish in color. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Holcus alpinus is valued for its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments and for its ornamental appeal in garden settings.</p>
