<p>Haplopappus uniflorus subsp.</p>
<p>typicus, commonly known as the single-flowered pappus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and typically small, narrow leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single flower per stem, which is surrounded by a pappus of bristles that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
