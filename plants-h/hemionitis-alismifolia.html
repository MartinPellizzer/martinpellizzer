                    <h1>Hemionitis alismifolia</h1>
<p>Hemionitis alismifolia, commonly known as the water fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to the wetlands of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically divided into narrow, blade-like segments. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments with abundant sunlight and nutrient-rich water. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemionitis alismifolia is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
