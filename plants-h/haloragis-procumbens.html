<p>Haloragis procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate water starwort, is a flowering plant native to parts of Australia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in wet or waterlogged soils, often found in swampy areas or along the edges of water bodies. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale blue, which bloom during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and arranged in a prostrate manner, allowing it to spread across the ground.</p>
<p>Haloragis procumbens plays a role in stabilizing soil in aquatic environments and provides habitat for various small invertebrates.</p>
