                    <h1>Hedysarum ornatum</h1>
<p>Hedysarum ornatum, commonly known as the showy peavine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of pink to purple pea-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Hedysarum ornatum has a climbing habit, using its tendrils to support itself on shrubs or trees.</p>
<p>It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobial bacteria in its root nodules.</p>
