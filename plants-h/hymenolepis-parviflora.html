<p>Hymenolepis parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered bladderworts, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and specialized structures called bladders, which trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in wet, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and marshes. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface.</p>
<p>Hymenolepis parviflora exhibits a unique adaptation for nutrient acquisition through its carnivorous behavior.</p>
