                    <h1>Hastifolia</h1>
<p>Hastifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in waterlogged soils.</p>
<p>Hastifolia is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water.</p>
