<p>Hoodia officinalis subsp.</p>
<p>officinalis, commonly known as the desert lily or hoodia, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and small, white flowers that bloom during the rainy season.</p>
<p>The plant has a unique ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. It is also known for containing a compound called pregnenolone, which has been studied for its potential appetite-suppressing properties.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species.</p>
