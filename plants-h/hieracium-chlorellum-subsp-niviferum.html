<p>Hieracium chlorellum subsp.</p>
<p>niviferum, commonly known as the snow-hued hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine white bloom.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a single head, which are surrounded by a ring of pale green to white ray florets. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, where it tolerates cold temperatures and poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
