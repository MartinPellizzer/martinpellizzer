<p>Horridocactus atroviridis, commonly known as the black viridian cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green to nearly black stems that are covered in spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are often hidden among the spines. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water once established.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and desert gardens.</p>
