<p>Helwingia himalaica, commonly known as the Himalayan helwingia, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayan regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, followed by distinctive, winged fruits that resemble tiny samaras. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories at high elevations.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental foliage and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical gardens.</p>
