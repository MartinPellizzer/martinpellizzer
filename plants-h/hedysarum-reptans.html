<p>Hedysarum reptans, commonly known as creeping sainfoin, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early summer. Its trifoliate leaves are compound, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape.</p>
<p>Hedysarum reptans is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and is used in ecological restoration and as a forage plant.</p>
