                    <h1>Habenaria fulva</h1>
<p>Habenaria fulva, commonly known as the golden twayblade, is a perennial orchid native to various regions in Asia and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden environments.</p>
