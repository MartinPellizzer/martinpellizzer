                    <h1>Hydnora johannis var. gigantea</h1>
<p>Hydnora johannis var. gigantea, commonly known as the giant hydnora, is a unique parasitic plant found primarily in the succulent Karoo region of South Africa.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing within the stems of certain species of Euphorbia. The plant produces a distinctive, fleshy, reddish-purple flower that emits a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators like flies. Its flowers are short-lived, opening only at night and closing by dawn.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized ecological role and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
