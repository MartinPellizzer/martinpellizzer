<p>Hymenogyne glabra subsp.</p>
<p>glabra, commonly known as the smooth hymenogyne, is a rare and understudied plant species native to Southeast Asia. It is a small shrub characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves that are typically elliptical in shape.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
