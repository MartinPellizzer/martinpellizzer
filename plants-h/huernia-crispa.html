                    <h1>Huernia crispa</h1>
<p>Huernia crispa, commonly known as the horned lithops, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the summer months. Its unique appearance, resembling miniature horns or stones, helps it blend into its arid environment.</p>
<p>Huernia crispa is well adapted to hot, dry conditions and requires minimal water to thrive.</p>
