<p>Huperzia serpentiformis, commonly known as the serpent fern, is a species of clubmoss native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, twisting, and often serpentine-like fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporophytes are usually small and clustered, with spore-producing structures called sporangia located on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>Huperzia serpentiformis is valued not only for its ornamental appearance but also for its traditional use in herbal medicine.</p>
