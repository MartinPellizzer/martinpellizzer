<p>Hylorhipsalis sulcata, commonly known as the zigzag spider plant, is a member of the Asparagaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its unique, cascading growth habit. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are often striped with a light green or white color, creating a striking visual contrast. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Hylorhipsalis sulcata is a popular choice for hanging baskets and indoor gardens due to its elegant appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
