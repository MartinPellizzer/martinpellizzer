                    <h1>Huperzia reflexa var. minor</h1>
<p>Huperzia reflexa var. minor, commonly known as the lesser cliff fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the Appalachian region of the United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, dense foliage and distinctive, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in small, rounded clusters called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky outcrops or in woodland areas.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to Huperzia reflexa, but it is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact growth habit.</p>
