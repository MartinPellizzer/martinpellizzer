                    <h1>Heterosperma ovale</h1>
<p>Heterosperma ovale, commonly known as the oval floating heart, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features rounded, waxy leaves that are typically green to reddish in color, allowing it to float on the surface of still or slow-moving water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, enabling it to colonize large areas in water bodies.</p>
<p>Heterosperma ovale plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
