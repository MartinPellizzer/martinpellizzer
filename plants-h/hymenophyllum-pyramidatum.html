<p>Hymenophyllum pyramidatum, commonly known as the pyramid moss, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the Hymenophyllaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, moss-like appearance with finely divided, needle-like leaves. This plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically found on tree trunks and rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures that help retain moisture.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves, contributing to its unique botanical structure.</p>
