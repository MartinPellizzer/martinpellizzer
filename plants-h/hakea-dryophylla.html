                    <h1>Hakea dryophylla</h1>
<p>Hakea dryophylla, commonly known as the dryland hakea, is a shrub native to western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and narrow, needle-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by woody, cylindrical fruits that contain seeds. Hakea dryophylla is well-suited to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal heathlands.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for native wildlife.</p>
