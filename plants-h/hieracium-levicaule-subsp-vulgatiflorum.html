<p>Hieracium levicaule subsp.</p>
<p>vulgatiflorum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves and produces numerous small, dandelion-like seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
