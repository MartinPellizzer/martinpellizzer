                            <h1>Hieracium Murorum Subsp. Selanderi</h1>
<p>Hieracium murorum subsp. selanderi is a rare and lesser-known member of the dandelion family found primarily in specific regions of Europe. This subspecies is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and subtle flower characteristics that set it apart from its more common relatives. Despite its modest appearance, it plays an important role in local ecosystems by supporting pollinators and contributing to biodiversity. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it faces threats that have led to its classification as a protected species in several countries. Studying this plant offers insights into the adaptability and conservation needs of rare flora.</p>
