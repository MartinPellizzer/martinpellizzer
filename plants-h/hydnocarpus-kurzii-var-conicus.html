                    <h1>Hydnocarpus kurzii var. conicus</h1>
<p>Hydnocarpus kurzii var. conicus, commonly known as the cone-shaped ironwood tree, is a tropical evergreen species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, heavy wood with a high oil content, which contributes to its durability and resistance to decay. The plant produces unique, spiny fruits that enclose the seeds, and its leaves are typically alternate and ovate. It thrives in humid, lowland tropical forests and is often found in secondary growth areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated for both timber and landscaping purposes.</p>
