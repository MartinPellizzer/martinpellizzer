<p>Helichrysum saxatile subsp.</p>
<p>errerae, commonly known as the rock everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that are tightly clustered and resemble tiny sunflowers. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in rock gardens and as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant.</p>
