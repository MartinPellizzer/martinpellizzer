<p>Habenaria debiliflora, commonly known as the slender lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and a dense, flowering spike that produces small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. It has a complex root system that helps it absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
