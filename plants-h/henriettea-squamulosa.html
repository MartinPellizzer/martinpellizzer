                    <h1>Henriettea squamulosa</h1>
<p>Henriettea squamulosa, commonly known as the squamulose henriettea, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely hairy, ovate leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in umbel-like clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Henriettea squamulosa is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
