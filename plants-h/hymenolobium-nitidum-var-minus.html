                    <h1>Hymenolobium nitidum var. minus</h1>
<p>Hymenolobium nitidum var. minus, commonly known as the smooth-leafed acacia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its small, pod-like fruits contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in dry environments.</p>
<p>The species is often used in traditional medicine and for soil stabilization in degraded landscapes.</p>
