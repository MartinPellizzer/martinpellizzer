The plant is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for coastal landscapes. Its leaves are often finely divided, giving it a feathery appearance, and it is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its resilience to salt spray and wind, which are common in its natural habitat.</p>
