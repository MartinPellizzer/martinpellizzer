                    <h1>Hymenopappus carrii</h1>
<p>Hymenopappus carrii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant has a low, sprawling growth habit with hairy stems and leaves adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. Its yellow flowers bloom in early spring, followed by the production of wind-dispersed seeds with feathery pappus structures.</p>
<p>Hymenopappus carrii plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and provides nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
