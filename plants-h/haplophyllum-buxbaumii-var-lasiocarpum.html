                    <h1>Haplophyllum buxbaumii var. lasiocarpum</h1>
<p>Haplophyllum buxbaumii var. lasiocarpum, commonly known as the woolly fruit haplophyllum, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, woolly coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered at the tips of its stems. Its fruit is a small, round capsule that becomes woody and hairy with age.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its unique morphology and adaptation to extreme climatic conditions.</p>
