                    <h1>Herniaria glabra</h1>
<p>Herniaria glabra, commonly known as sand pearl or white sandplant, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and coastal regions of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fleshy, green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor it in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Herniaria glabra is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in harsh conditions.</p>
