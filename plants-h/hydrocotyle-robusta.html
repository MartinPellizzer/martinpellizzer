                    <h1>Hydrocotyle robusta</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle robusta, commonly known as the broadleaf water shield, is a perennial aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features floating leaves that are typically broad and rounded, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often clustered together, and it has slender, branching stems that can spread across the water's surface. Its roots are anchored in the sediment at the bottom of water bodies, allowing it to thrive in still or slow-moving waters.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle robusta plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
