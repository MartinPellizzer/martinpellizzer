<p>Heracleum turugisanense, commonly known as the Turugisan cow parsnip, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, umbrella-like compound leaves.</p>
<p>It is native to Central Asia and thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and riverbanks. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in compound umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>However, it contains phototoxic compounds that can cause skin irritation upon exposure to sunlight.</p>
