                    <h1>Hulsea vulcanica</h1>
<p>Hulsea vulcanica, commonly known as the volcanic hulsea, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, volcanic soils and is adapted to harsh, arid conditions. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom during the dry season, attracting specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hulsea vulcanica is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
