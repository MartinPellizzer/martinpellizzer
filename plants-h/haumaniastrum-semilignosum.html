                    <h1>Haumaniastrum semilignosum</h1>
<p>Haumaniastrum semilignosum, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a woody base, which gives it its semi-lignified appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to desert ecosystems.</p>
