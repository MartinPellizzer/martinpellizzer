                    <h1>Heteranthera kotschyana</h1>
<p>Heteranthera kotschyana, commonly known as the broadleaf water hyssop, is a perennial aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with roots that anchor it in muddy substrates. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in spikes, often in the summer months. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>Heteranthera kotschyana is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality.</p>
