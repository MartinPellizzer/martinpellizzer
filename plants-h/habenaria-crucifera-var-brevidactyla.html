<p>Habenaria crucifera var. brevidactyla, commonly known as the short-clawed marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features erect, hairy stems with a few leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a raceme. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, organic soil of its habitat.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its shorter, more compact flower stalks compared to other varieties of Habenaria crucifera.</p>
