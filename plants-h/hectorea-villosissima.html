<p>It features dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage covered in fine, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Hectorea villosissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
