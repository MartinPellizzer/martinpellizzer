<p>Hymenophyllum cuneatum var. calyciforme, commonly known as the calyciform shield fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that often have a shield-like appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variety is noted for its unique morphology and is often found in humid, shaded habitats across Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
