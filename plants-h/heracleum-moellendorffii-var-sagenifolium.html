                    <h1>Heracleum moellendorffii var. sagenifolium</h1>
<p>Heracleum moellendorffii var. sagenifolium, commonly known as giant hogweed, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, umbrella-like compound leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, with a distinctive white, hairy underside. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in umbrella-shaped inflorescences, which are followed by long, slender seed pods. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found near waterways, roadsides, and in forest clearings.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it is considered an invasive species in many regions and requires caution when handling.</p>
