<p>Hemixanthidium montanum, commonly known as the mountain hemixanthidium, is a rare flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine soils, where it adapts to cold and nutrient-poor conditions. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing white or pale yellow flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
