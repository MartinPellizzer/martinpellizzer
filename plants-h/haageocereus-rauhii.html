                    <h1>Haageocereus rauhii</h1>
<p>Haageocereus rauhii, commonly known as the Rauh's night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its columnar stems and large, showy night-blooming flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant produces spines that provide protection from herbivores and help reduce water loss through shade. Its flowers open in the evening and close by morning, a trait that aids in pollination by nocturnal insects.</p>
<p>Haageocereus rauhii is adapted to extreme desert conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and minimizing transpiration through a waxy cuticle.</p>
