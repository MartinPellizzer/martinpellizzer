The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or arctic tundra environments. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value in rock gardens.</p>
<p>Hypericum exiguum is also noted for its medicinal properties, though it is less commonly used than its larger relatives.</p>
