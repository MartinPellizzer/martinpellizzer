                    <h1>Hirculus bullieanus</h1>
<p>Hirculus bullieanus, commonly known as the moonlit orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes.</p>
<p>It features delicate, pale violet petals with a subtle iridescence that shimmers under moonlight, giving it its common name. The plant has a compact, upright growth habit with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery绒毛. Its flowers bloom only during the lunar cycle, typically at night, and are pollinated by nocturnal moths.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ecological niche, Hirculus bullieanus is considered a conservation priority.</p>
