                    <h1>Hemionitis rouxii</h1>
<p>Hemionitis rouxii, commonly known as the sandmat, is a rare and unique succulent native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hemionitidaceae and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white, powdery bloom, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces delicate, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Hemionitis rouxii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
