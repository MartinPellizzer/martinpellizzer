<p>Hypochaeris chrysantha, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with a central disk surrounded by ray florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Hypochaeris chrysantha is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes.</p>
