<p>Heldreichia bupleurifolia subsp.</p>
<p>rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leafed heldreichia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its distinctive round or ovate leaves that are often densely hairy, giving it a unique appearance.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in greenish-yellow inflorescences, and bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
