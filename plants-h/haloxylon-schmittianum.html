<p>Haloxylon schmittianum, commonly known as the Schmitt's haloxylon, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to harsh desert environments, with small, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish flowers and small, hard fruits that are dispersed by wind. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it highly resilient to drought.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
