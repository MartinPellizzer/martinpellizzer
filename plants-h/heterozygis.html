                    <h1>Heterozygis</h1>
<p>Heterozygis, commonly known as the heterozygous plant, is a term used in botany to describe a plant that has two different alleles for a particular gene.</p>
<p>This genetic variation can result in diverse phenotypic expressions, such as different flower colors or growth patterns. Heterozygous plants are often used in breeding programs to introduce desirable traits. They can be either homozygous or heterozygous depending on the genetic makeup of their parents.</p>
<p>The study of heterozygis is crucial in understanding genetic diversity and plant adaptation.</p>
