                    <h1>Hymenophyllum macrosorum</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum macrosorum, commonly known as the broad-leaf fern, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is native to the temperate regions of the southern hemisphere, including Australia, New Zealand, and South America. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum macrosorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in terrariums or as a houseplant.</p>
