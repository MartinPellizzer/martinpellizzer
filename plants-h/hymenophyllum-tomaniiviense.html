<p>Hymenophyllum tomaniiviense, commonly known as the Toamani fern, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, moss-like fronds that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant has a unique structure with narrow, linear leaves that are covered in a dense layer of tiny, hair-like structures called rhizoids. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
