                    <h1>Hymenophyllum praetervisum var. australiense</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum praetervisum var. australiense, commonly known as the Australian filmy fern, is a small, delicate fern native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in a fine, translucent layer of tissue, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in small groups on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among members of the Hymenophyllum genus.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its slightly broader fronds and a more robust growth habit compared to other varieties within the species.</p>
