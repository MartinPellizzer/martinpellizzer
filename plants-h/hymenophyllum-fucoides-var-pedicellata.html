                    <h1>Hymenophyllum fucoides var. pedicellata</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum fucoides var. pedicellata, commonly known as the pedicellate wall moss, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and dense, cushion-like growth habit. The leaves are narrowly lanceolate, with a distinct midrib and a serrated or toothed margin. The sporangia are clustered in small, stalked clusters called pedicels, which give the variety its name.</p>
<p>This variety is often found on tree trunks and rocks in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
