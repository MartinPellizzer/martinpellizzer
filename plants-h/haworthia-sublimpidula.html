                    <h1>Haworthia sublimpidula</h1>
<p>Haworthia sublimpidula, commonly known as the glass plant, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of fleshy, translucent leaves that often resemble glass, giving it its common name. The leaves are typically pale green with a bluish tinge and have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, white, star-shaped flowers on tall, slender stems during the summer months.</p>
<p>This plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and unique appearance.</p>
