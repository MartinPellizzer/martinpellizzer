                    <h1>Hosta lancifolia f. subchrocea</h1>
<p>Hosta lancifolia f. subchrocea, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hosta, is a cultivar characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often a striking shade of chartreuse.</p>
<p>This variety thrives in partial to full shade, making it ideal for woodland gardens or shaded borders. The foliage tends to be more compact compared to other hosta varieties, with a dense, upright growth habit. It produces small, fragrant flowers in late summer, though these are less showy than the foliage.</p>
<p>The plant is relatively low maintenance, preferring moist, well-drained soil and moderate to cool temperatures.</p>
