<p>Hieracium murorum subsp.</p>
<p>subpersimile, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, often hairy stems.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and forms dense mats due to its rhizomatous growth habit. Its leaves are broadly lance-shaped, with a rough texture, and its yellow flowers are arranged in clusters, blooming from late spring to early autumn.</p>
<p>It is often considered a weed but plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
