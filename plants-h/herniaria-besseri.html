<p>Herniaria besseri, commonly known as the Bessera sandplant, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, green, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant produces tiny white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a delicate floral element to its habitat. Its root system is adapted to stabilize sandy soils, making it an important pioneer species in disturbed or degraded environments.</p>
<p>Herniaria besseri is also valued for its ability to prevent soil erosion and its role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
