                    <h1>Hymenidium macrochlaenum</h1>
<p>Hymenidium macrochlaenum, commonly known as the giant yellow lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It features a bright yellow to orange thallus with a distinctive, leathery texture. The plant's structure consists of a symbiotic association between a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga, and a fungal component. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique color and morphology, it is a notable species in ecological studies of lichen communities.</p>
