                    <h1>Herniaria glabra var. acrochaeta</h1>
<p>Herniaria glabra var. acrochaeta, commonly known as the smooth herniaria, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, bead-like fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry landscapes.</p>
