<p>Hieracium sessilifolium, commonly known as the sessile-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk, and are generally lance-shaped.</p>
<p>The flowers are yellow and occur in dense clusters, making it a distinctive and often invasive species in certain regions.</p>
