<p>Hohenbergia mucroniflora, commonly known as the pointed-flower hohenbergia, is a species of flowering plant native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces striking, upward-facing inflorescences with small, white or pale pink flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Hohenbergia mucroniflora is popular among succulent and bromeliad enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
