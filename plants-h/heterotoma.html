                    <h1>Heterotoma</h1>
<p>Heterotoma, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves, relying instead on its roots for photosynthesis. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers that bloom once a year, typically in the summer months. Heterotoma thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on the trunks of trees in the Florida panhandle.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is listed as an endangered species.</p>
