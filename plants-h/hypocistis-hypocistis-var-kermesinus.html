                    <h1>Hypocistis hypocistis var. kermesinus</h1>
<p>Hypocistis hypocistis var. kermesinus, commonly known as the Kermesine woolly aphid, is a variant of the woolly aphid species native to certain regions of Europe.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its unique morphological features, including a distinctive waxy coating that covers its body. It typically inhabits specific host plants, such as species within the genus *Prunus*, where it feeds on sap. The plant's appearance is often altered by the presence of its colonies, which can lead to visible deformities on the host.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, this variant is of interest to botanists and entomologists alike.</p>
