<p>Heteroneuron subcrenatum, commonly known as the smooth bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used for trapping prey. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often reduced to scale-like structures, and it lacks true roots.</p>
<p>Heteroneuron subcrenatum is a carnivorous plant that supplements its nutrient intake by capturing and digesting small aquatic organisms.</p>
