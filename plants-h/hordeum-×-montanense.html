                    <h1>Hordeum × montanense</h1>
<p>Hordeum × montanense, commonly known as the mountain barley, is a naturally occurring hybrid species within the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and loose, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed spikelets. This plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces seeds that are similar in structure to those of other barley species.</p>
<p>Hordeum × montanense plays a role in ecological systems by providing forage for wildlife and contributing to soil stability in mountainous habitats.</p>
