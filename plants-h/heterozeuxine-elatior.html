                    <h1>Heterozeuxine elatior</h1>
<p>Heterozeuxine elatior, commonly known as the greater marsh helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, greenish-white flowers with prominent, spurred petals. Native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe, it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant is often found in shaded environments, such as along riverbanks and in woodland edges.</p>
<p>Its morphology reflects adaptations to its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat, with specialized roots for absorbing nutrients from waterlogged soil.</p>
