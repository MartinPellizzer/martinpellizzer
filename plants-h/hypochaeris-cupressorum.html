                    <h1>Hypochaeris cupressorum</h1>
<p>Hypochaeris cupressorum, commonly known as the creeping cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that produces yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early summer. The plant has a mat-forming habit, with hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help it thrive in dry, disturbed soils. It is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas where it can spread rapidly.</p>
<p>The species is characterized by its ability to form dense colonies, making it both a common weed and a valuable source of nectar for pollinators.</p>
