                    <h1>Hydrocotyle pygmaea</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle pygmaea, commonly known as the little water pennywort, is a small aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. The plant has delicate, floating leaves that are usually less than 1 inch in diameter, with a waxy surface that helps it stay afloat. Its flowers are small and white, appearing in clusters, and it blooms from late spring to early autumn.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle pygmaea plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through its natural filtration processes.</p>
