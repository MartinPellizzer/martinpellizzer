                    <h1>Hemionitis opaca</h1>
<p>Hemionitis opaca, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a unique aquatic fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands, where it attaches itself to submerged rocks or logs. The plant has a delicate, feathery appearance with small, lance-shaped fronds that are often translucent, giving it its ghostly nickname. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Hemionitis opaca plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen for various aquatic organisms.</p>
