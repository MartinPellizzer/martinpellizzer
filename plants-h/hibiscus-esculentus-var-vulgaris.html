                    <h1>Hibiscus esculentus var. vulgaris</h1>
<p>Hibiscus esculentus var. vulgaris, commonly known as okra, is a tropical flowering plant native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to deep red. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous edible seeds enclosed in a mucilaginous pulp. The mucilage, which gives the fruit its slimy texture, is rich in soluble fiber and is often used in cooking.</p>
<p>Okra is cultivated for both its nutritional value and its use in traditional medicine.</p>
