<p>Huernia occulta, commonly known as the hidden horned lithops, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, fleshy leaves that resemble small horns, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. Its unique appearance and ability to thrive in harsh conditions make it a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure its survival.</p>
