                    <h1>Hematodes</h1>
<p>Hematodes, commonly known as blood worms, are aquatic annelids belonging to the family Tubifex.</p>
<p>They are characterized by their segmented bodies and a distinct, reddish coloration due to the presence of hemoglobin in their blood. These organisms are often found in freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and aquariums. Hematodes play a role in decomposing organic matter and are sometimes used as fish food.</p>
<p>Their life cycle includes both aquatic and terrestrial stages, depending on the species.</p>
