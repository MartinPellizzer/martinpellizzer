                    <h1>Hydrocotyle verticillata var. longipedunculata</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle verticillata var. longipedunculata, commonly known as the long-pedunculate marsh pennywort, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features palmate leaves that are typically divided into five to seven lobes, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters at the ends of long peduncles, which distinguish this variety from others in the species. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread via rhizomes make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems.</p>
