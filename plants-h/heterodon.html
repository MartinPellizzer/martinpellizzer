                    <h1>Heterodon</h1>
<p>Heterodon, commonly known as the horned toad, is a genus of lizard belonging to the family Phrynosomatidae.</p>
<p>These reptiles are characterized by their distinctive, bumpy, and often horn-like protrusions on their heads and bodies. They are primarily found in arid and semi-arid regions of North America. Heterodon species are known for their ability to camouflage effectively in their desert environments.</p>
<p>Their botanical aspects are less relevant, as they are not plants, but their ecological role in desert ecosystems is significant.</p>
