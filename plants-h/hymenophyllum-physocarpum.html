<p>Hymenophyllum physocarpum, commonly known as the bladder-leaf fern, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found on trees in tropical and subtropical regions. The fronds are usually narrowly lance-shaped and have a unique, curled appearance.</p>
<p>Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
