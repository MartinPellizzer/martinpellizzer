                    <h1>Halerpestes salsuginosa</h1>
<p>Halerpestes salsuginosa, commonly known as the saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, adapting to harsh, saline environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is often found growing on saline soils and in coastal areas where other plants struggle to survive.</p>
<p>Its resilience makes it an important component of ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
