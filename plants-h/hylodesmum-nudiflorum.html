<p>Hylodesmum nudiflorum, commonly known as the naked-flower hylodesmum, is a member of the family Lecanoraceae and is characterized by its distinctive foliose thallus.</p>
<p>It typically grows on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments, forming dense, compact cushions. The plant lacks true leaves and flowers, instead having a structure composed of flattened, leaf-like lobes. It is a non-photosynthetic lichen, relying on its algal partner for nutrition.</p>
<p>This species is often found in regions with low humidity and high sunlight exposure.</p>
