                    <h1>Hereroa aspera</h1>
<p>Hereroa aspera, commonly known as the rough hereroa, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and small, serrated leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the cooler months. It is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can withstand prolonged periods of drought.</p>
<p>Hereroa aspera is often found in rocky outcrops and dry savannas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects.</p>
