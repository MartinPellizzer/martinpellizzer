                    <h1>Hippocrepis comosa f. nevadensis</h1>
<p>Hippocrepis comosa f. nevadensis, commonly known as the Nevada woolly gentian, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the high mountain regions of Nevada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, woolly foliage and striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 8,000 feet. It is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and open slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species of high-elevation ecosystems.</p>
