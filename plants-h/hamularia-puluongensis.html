                    <h1>Hamularia puluongensis</h1>
<p>Hamularia puluongensis, commonly known as the Bornean ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces striking, pale green to white flowers with a distinctive, ghost-like appearance, which bloom during the dry season. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hamularia puluongensis is considered critically endangered and is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists.</p>
