<p>Hypericum patulum var. forrestii, commonly known as the creeping St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features wiry, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers with prominent orange stamens, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are oval and covered in fine hairs, and it is often found in woodland or alpine environments.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
