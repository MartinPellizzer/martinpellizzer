                    <h1>Hymenolobus perpusillus</h1>
<p>Hymenolobus perpusillus, commonly known as the dwarf spider orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories and has slender, hairy stems. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spike, often mistaken for spider-like structures due to their appearance. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the surrounding soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for survival.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
