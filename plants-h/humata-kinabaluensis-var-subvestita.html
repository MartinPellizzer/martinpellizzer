                    <h1>Humata kinabaluensis var. subvestita</h1>
<p>Humata kinabaluensis var. subvestita, commonly known as the Bornean velvet fern, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, velvety texture, which is due to the dense covering of fine, soft hairs on its foliage. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette formation. It produces delicate, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the cooler months, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat degradation and climate change.</p>
