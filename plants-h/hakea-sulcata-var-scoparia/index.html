                            <h1>Hakea Sulcata Var. Scoparia</h1>
<p>Coastal hakea, scientifically known as Hakea sulcata var. scoparia, is a unique shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions such as salt spray and strong winds. Its distinctive appearance includes narrow, needle-like leaves and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The coastal hakea plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife. Due to its ecological significance, it is often protected and cultivated in conservation areas.</p>
