                    <h1>Hymenasplenium ofeliae</h1>
<p>Hymenasplenium ofeliae, commonly known as the Ofelia's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Pterobryaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a feature common among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on the bark of trees or rocks in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Hymenasplenium ofeliae is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
