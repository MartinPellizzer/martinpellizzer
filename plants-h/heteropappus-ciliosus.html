                    <h1>Heteropappus ciliosus</h1>
<p>Heteropappus ciliosus, commonly known as the fringed pappus plant, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in a head, surrounded by a pappus of bristles that aid in wind dispersal. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Heteropappus ciliosus is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in sandy or gravelly habitats.</p>
