<p>Helichrysum gravesii, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its showy, golden-yellow flowers that resemble small suns. The plant produces small, papery bracts that persist after the flowers have faded, giving it a long-lasting appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in floral arrangements due to its ability to retain color and form when dried.</p>
