                    <h1>Hordeum ischnatherum</h1>
<p>Hordeum ischnatherum, commonly known as needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and compact growth habit, which help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny grains, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient conditions.</p>
<p>Hordeum ischnatherum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitats.</p>
