<p>Hesperis matronalis subsp.</p>
<p>inodora, commonly known as the sweet rocket or evening snowflake, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its fragrant, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The subspecies inodora is distinguished by its lack of a strong scent, unlike the typical Hesperis matronalis. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>This plant is also noted for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
