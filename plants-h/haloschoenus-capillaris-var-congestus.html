<p>Haloschoenus capillaris var. congestus, commonly known as the tufted saltmarsh grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and brackish wetlands, often found in estuaries and tidal flats. The plant is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowering stems produce small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are adapted to withstand coastal conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
