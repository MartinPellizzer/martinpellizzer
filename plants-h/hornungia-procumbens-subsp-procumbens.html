<p>Hornungia procumbens subsp.</p>
<p>procumbens, commonly known as the creeping hornungia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of prostrate stems covered with fine, glandular hairs.</p>

<p>It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with long winters.</p>
