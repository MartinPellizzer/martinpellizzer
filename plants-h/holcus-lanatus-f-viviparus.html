                    <h1>Holcus lanatus f. viviparus</h1>
<p>Holcus lanatus f. viviparus, commonly known as the viviparous meadowgrass, is a variant of the common bentgrass.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. This plant is typically found in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often in meadows or along stream banks. One of its notable botanical features is the production of viviparous shoots, which can develop into small plants while still attached to the parent plant.</p>
<p>This adaptation aids in vegetative propagation and enhances its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
