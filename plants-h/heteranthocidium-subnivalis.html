<p>Heteranthocidium subnivalis, commonly known as the snow cushion, is a low-growing plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form, which helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are leathery and evergreen, adapted to retain moisture in cold, arid environments.</p>
<p>Heteranthocidium subnivalis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna.</p>
