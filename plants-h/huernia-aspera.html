<p>Huernia aspera, commonly known as the African violet cactus, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are usually covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Huernia aspera is often grown as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
