                    <h1>Halimium calycinum</h1>
<p>Halimium calycinum, commonly known as the sweetroot or rock rose, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Halimium calycinum is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its ornamental value and hardy nature.</p>
