                    <h1>Hakea marginata</h1>
<p>Hakea marginata, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and distinctive, cylindrical flower spikes that bloom in spring. The plant has adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden winds, making it resilient in coastal environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Hakea marginata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and unique appearance.</p>
