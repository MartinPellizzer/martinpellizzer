<p>Heteroderis pusilla var. khorassanica, commonly known as the Khorasan dwarf nematode, is a species of plant-parasitic nematode.</p>
<p>It primarily infects the roots of various crops, including legumes and grasses, causing significant damage to plant growth. The nematode's life cycle involves several stages, with the infective second-stage juvenile being the primary pathogenic stage. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in soils with high organic matter content.</p>
<p>Due to its impact on agriculture, it is a subject of ongoing research for effective management strategies.</p>
