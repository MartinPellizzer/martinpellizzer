                    <h1>Hydnophytum angustifolium</h1>
<p>Hydnophytum angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it produces its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Its unique ecological role makes it an important species in forest ecosystems.</p>
