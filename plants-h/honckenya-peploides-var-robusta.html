                    <h1>Honckenya peploides var. robusta</h1>
<p>Honckenya peploides var. robusta, commonly known as the robust sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it well-adapted to harsh, drought-prone climates.</p>
