<p>Hasteola praetermissa, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind and animals.</p>
<p>Hasteola praetermissa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
