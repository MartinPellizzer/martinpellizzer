                    <h1>Haemanthus brachyandrus</h1>
<p>Haemanthus brachyandrus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved haemanthus, is a perennial herb native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bright red, lantern-shaped flowers during the summer months. The plant is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. It is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and hardy nature.</p>
<p>The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
