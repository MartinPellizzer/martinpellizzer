<p>Hieracium jurassicum subsp.</p>
<p>tephroprenanthes, commonly known as the Jurassic hawkweed, is a rare and ancient plant species with a unique botanical profile. It is characterized by its basal rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant is typically found in calcareous soils in mountainous regions, reflecting its preference for specific environmental conditions. Its subspecies name, *tephroprenanthes*, alludes to its historical association with prehistoric landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical and paleobotanical study.</p>
