                    <h1>Haplochorema extensum</h1>
<p>Haplochorema extensum, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a small, evergreen herbaceous plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, linear leaves and small, clustered spore-producing structures called strobila. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a unique life cycle involving a dominant gametophyte stage and a short-lived sporophyte stage.</p>
<p>Its simple morphology and ancient lineage make it an important subject in the study of early plant evolution.</p>
