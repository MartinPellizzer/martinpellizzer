                    <h1>Herniaria hirsuta</h1>
<p>Herniaria hirsuta, commonly known as hairy rock-cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and arid environments in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds.</p>
<p>Herniaria hirsuta is often found in crevices and on limestone soils, where it thrives in poor, well-drained conditions.</p>
