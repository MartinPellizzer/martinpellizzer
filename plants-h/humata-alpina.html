                    <h1>Humata alpina</h1>
<p>Humata alpina, commonly known as the alpine humata, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, adapting to cold and high-altitude conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale pink, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in poor soil.</p>
<p>Humata alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable climate conditions.</p>
