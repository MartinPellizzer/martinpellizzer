                    <h1>Habenaria subecalcarata</h1>
<p>Habenaria subecalcarata, commonly known as the slender lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and a dense, spiral arrangement of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and forest understories. Its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its reproductive success.</p>
<p>The orchid's rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in the soil while absorbing nutrients.</p>
