<p>Holosepalum humifusum, commonly known as the creeping sepal orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, often prostrate stems that hug the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in loose clusters, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, contributing to its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its unique floral structure, which includes a single sepal that is fused to the petals, forming a distinctive hood-like shape.</p>
