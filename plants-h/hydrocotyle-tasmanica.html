                    <h1>Hydrocotyle tasmanica</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle tasmanica, commonly known as Tasmanian water shield, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Tasmania and southern Australia.</p>
<p>It has heart-shaped leaves that are typically floating or submerged, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in still or slow-moving water.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle tasmanica plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
