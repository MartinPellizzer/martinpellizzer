<p>Hieracium permacrescens, commonly known as the giant hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows to heights of up to 1.5 meters, with broad, lance-shaped leaves and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native flora.</p>
