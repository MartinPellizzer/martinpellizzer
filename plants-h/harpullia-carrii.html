                    <h1>Harpullia carrii</h1>
<p>Harpullia carrii, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a tropical evergreen tree native to northern Australia and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and its ability to thrive in saline and waterlogged soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by edible, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Harpullia carrii plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and preventing soil erosion.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations to saltwater environments make it a key component of mangrove forests.</p>
