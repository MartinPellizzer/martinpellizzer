<p>Hedyotis canadensis, commonly known as Canadian pennywort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America.</p>
<p>It features small, opposite leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces tiny, white or yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often resembling a cluster of pearls.

<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in its habitat.</p>
