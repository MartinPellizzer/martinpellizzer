                            <h1>Halimium Scoparium</h1>
<p>Scorpion's tail, scientifically known as Halimium scoparium, is a rare and striking plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is named for its distinctive, spiky flower clusters that resemble the tail of a scorpion. This evergreen shrub thrives in rocky and sunny environments, often found on coastal cliffs and limestone soils. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and plant enthusiasts. Despite its beauty, it remains a threatened species due to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
