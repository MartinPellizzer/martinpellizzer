                    <h1>Hypericum mororanense</h1>
<p>Hypericum mororanense, commonly known as the Morrocan St. John's Wort, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, yellow, four-petaled flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has woody stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes.</p>
<p>While its chemical composition is similar to other Hypericum species, it is less commonly used in herbal medicine.</p>
