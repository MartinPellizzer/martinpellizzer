                    <h1>Helonias yunnanensis</h1>
<p>Helonias yunnanensis, commonly known as Yunnan's marsh orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China, where it thrives in wet, boggy habitats. The plant features a slender, erect stem with several narrow, grass-like leaves. Its most notable characteristic is its showy, violet-blue flower spikes, which bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range.</p>
