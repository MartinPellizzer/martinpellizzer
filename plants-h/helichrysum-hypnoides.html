                    <h1>Helichrysum hypnoides</h1>
<p>Helichrysum hypnoides, commonly known as the silverleaf everlasting or African dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its fibrous roots help prevent soil erosion, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
<p>The plant's name comes from the Greek words "helios" (sun) and "chrysos" (gold), referring to its sun-like appearance and golden flowers.</p>
