<p>Hieracium adenopsilon, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Its flowers are composed of both ray and disk florets, typical of the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>The plant's hairy leaves and stems provide it with some drought tolerance and help in reducing water loss.</p>
