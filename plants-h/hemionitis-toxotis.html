                    <h1>Hemionitis toxotis</h1>
<p>Hemionitis toxotis, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, delicate plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, grass-like leaves that are typically clustered in dense mats. The plant thrives in rocky crevices and shaded areas, where it can retain moisture in dry environments. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Hemionitis toxotis plays a minor but ecologically significant role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for small invertebrates.</p>
