<p>Hydrocotyle verticillata var. verticillata, commonly known as the water pennywort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are typically arranged in a whorl at the base of each stem. The plant produces tiny white flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in shallow water and moist soil, often found in ponds, streams, and wetlands.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth makes it both a useful indicator species and a potential invasive in non-native environments.</p>
