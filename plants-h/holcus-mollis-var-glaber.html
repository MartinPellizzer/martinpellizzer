<p>Holcus mollis var. glaber, commonly known as velvet grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, silky-textured leaves that give it a soft appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are typically green or pale brown in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>
