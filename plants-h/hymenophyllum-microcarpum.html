                    <h1>Hymenophyllum microcarpum</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum microcarpum, commonly known as the small-fruited filmy fern, is a delicate epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, translucent fronds that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant typically grows on rocks or trees in humid, shaded environments, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in small, round groups on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>The species is known for its unique morphology and is often found in moist, shaded forest habitats.</p>
