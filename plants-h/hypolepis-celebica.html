<p>Hypolepis celebica, commonly known as the Celebes water fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are often submerged or floating in water, adapting to aquatic environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and colonize wetlands and marshy areas. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
<p>Hypolepis celebica plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygenation for small water organisms.</p>
