                    <h1>Hedera nodosa</h1>
<p>Hedera nodosa, commonly known as the nodding ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are typically heart-shaped and have a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by orange-red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. Hedera nodosa thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and dense foliage make it an effective ground cover in ornamental landscaping.</p>
