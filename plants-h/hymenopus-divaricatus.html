                    <h1>Hymenopus divaricatus</h1>
<p>Hymenopus divaricatus, commonly known as the creeping marsh grass, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread extensively across moist soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, greenish-white flowers that are wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slightly hairy surface.</p>
<p>Hymenopus divaricatus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
