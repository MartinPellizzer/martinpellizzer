                    <h1>Hymenopappus wrightii</h1>
<p>Hymenopappus wrightii, commonly known as Wright's mistletoe, is a parasitic plant native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It attaches to its host trees, primarily junipers, through haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
