<p>Helianthemum brachypodum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, upright stems covered in fine, silver-gray hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, adding a bright splash of color to rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to withstand drought and intense sunlight.</p>
<p>Helianthemum brachypodum is often found in coastal areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience.</p>
