<p>Humata hymenophylloides, commonly known as the silky fern, is a delicate, epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae, which is characterized by small, leathery leaves and a unique ability to thrive in high humidity. The plant's leaves are finely divided and covered in a dense, silky coating that helps reduce water loss. It typically grows on trees or rocks in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
