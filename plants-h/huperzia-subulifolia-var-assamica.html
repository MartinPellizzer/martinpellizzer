                    <h1>Huperzia subulifolia var. assamica</h1>
<p>Huperzia subulifolia var. assamica, commonly known as the Assam clubmoss, is a rare and endangered species belonging to the family Huperziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, dense foliage and short, needle-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the leaves, a feature common in many clubmosses.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
