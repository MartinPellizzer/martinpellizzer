                    <h1>Hydrocotyle macrophylla</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle macrophylla, commonly known as the giant water shield, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It features broad, floating leaves that are typically 5 to 10 inches in diameter, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late summer. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of ponds and lakes, allowing it to thrive in still or slow-moving water.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle macrophylla plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and stabilizing water surfaces.</p>
