                    <h1>Herrea gydouwensis</h1>
<p>Herrea gydouwensis, commonly known as the Gondwana mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It relies on a specific host tree, typically the knobthorn (Combretum species), for water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are small and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Herrea gydouwensis plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its habitat by supporting biodiversity through its interactions with host plants and animals.</p>
