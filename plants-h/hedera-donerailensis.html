                    <h1>Hedera donerailensis</h1>
<p>Hedera donerailensis, commonly known as the Donerailensis ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features dark green, leathery leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by dark blue-black berries. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in shaded woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture, though it is not as widely grown as other ivy species.</p>
