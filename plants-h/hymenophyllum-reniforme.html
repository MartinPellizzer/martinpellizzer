                    <h1>Hymenophyllum reniforme</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum reniforme, commonly known as the kidney fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant's spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a kidney-shaped indusium. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high moisture levels to grow.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and intricate structure make it a popular choice for terrariums and shaded garden settings.</p>
