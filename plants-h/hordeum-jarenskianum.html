<p>Hordeum jarenskianum, commonly known as the Jarenskian barley, is a wild grass species native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many grasses. Hordeum jarenskianum is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject for studies on grassland ecology and plant adaptation.</p>
