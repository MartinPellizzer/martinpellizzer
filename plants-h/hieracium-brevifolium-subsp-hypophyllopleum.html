<p>Hieracium brevifolium subsp.</p>
<p>hypophyllopleum, commonly known as the short-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in arid conditions.</p>

<p>This subspecies is often found in meadows, grasslands, and rocky soils, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
