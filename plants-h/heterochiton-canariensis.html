                    <h1>Heterochiton canariensis</h1>
<p>Heterochiton canariensis, commonly known as the Canary Islands rock lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in the unique microclimates of the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungal component and a photosynthetic alga or cyanobacterium. This lichen is typically found growing on rocky substrates, where it plays a role in soil formation and nutrient cycling. Its structure consists of a dense, crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to the surface.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species within the archipelago.</p>
