                    <h1>Herniaria fruticosa var. recurvifolia</h1>
<p>Herniaria fruticosa var. recurvifolia, commonly known as the hooked herniaria, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, greenish-gray leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its succulent leaves store water, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for rock gardens or coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>The variety recurvifolia is distinguished by its curved leaf tips, which give it a unique appearance compared to other forms of Herniaria.</p>
