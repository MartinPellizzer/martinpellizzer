                    <h1>Haematoxylum</h1>
<p>Haematoxylum, commonly known as red sanders, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Asia, particularly India, and is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown heartwood. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is known for its aromatic properties. Haematoxylum species are valued for their timber, which is used in furniture and musical instruments.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, many species are now endangered and protected under international conservation agreements.</p>
