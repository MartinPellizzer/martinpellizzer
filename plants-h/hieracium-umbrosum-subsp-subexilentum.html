<p>Hieracium umbrosum subsp.</p>
<p>subexilentum, commonly known as the shadowy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and basal rosettes of dark green, hairy leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in leaf and flower structure.</p>
