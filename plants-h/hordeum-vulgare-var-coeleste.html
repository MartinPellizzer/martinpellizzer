                    <h1>Hordeum vulgare var. coeleste</h1>
<p>Hordeum vulgare var. coeleste, commonly known as blue barley, is a variant of barley characterized by its striking blue or purple hues in its grains.</p>
<p>This variety is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in cooler climates. The blue coloration is due to the presence of anthocyanins, which are natural pigments with antioxidant properties. It is often cultivated for both its ornamental value and its use in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and compact spikelets.</p>
