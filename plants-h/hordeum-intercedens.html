                    <h1>Hordeum intercedens</h1>
<p>Hordeum intercedens, commonly known as the intermediate barley, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and spikelets that bear small, two-rowed flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Hordeum intercedens is often found in association with other grasses and forbs, contributing to soil stabilization and biodiversity.</p>
<p>Its seeds are sometimes used in traditional agricultural practices, though it is not as economically significant as domesticated barley species.</p>
