<p>Hoya cinnamomifolia, commonly known as the cinnamon leaf hoya, is a tropical evergreen vine native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are a deep green with a slight sheen, often tinged with red or purple at the edges. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pale pink, which bloom in the summer months. Its aerial roots allow it to climb and attach to surfaces, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets or trellises.</p>
<p>Hoya cinnamomifolia is relatively low-maintenance, requiring bright indirect light and well-draining soil.</p>
