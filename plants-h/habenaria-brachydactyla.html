<p>Habenaria brachydactyla, commonly known as the narrow-lobed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late summer or early autumn. The plant features long, strap-like leaves and produces a single spike of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses.</p>
