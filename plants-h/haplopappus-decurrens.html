                    <h1>Haplopappus decurrens</h1>
<p>Haplopappus decurrens, commonly known as the creeping pappus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, succulent stems and small, clustered leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, followed by small, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in a pappus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gravelly slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is considered a valuable plant for stabilizing soil in arid environments.</p>
