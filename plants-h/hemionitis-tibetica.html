                    <h1>Hemionitis tibetica</h1>
<p>Hemionitis tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan hemionitis, is a rare fern species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hemionitidaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the extreme conditions of its alpine habitat. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing capsules, are typically found on the undersides of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile ecosystem, Hemionitis tibetica is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
