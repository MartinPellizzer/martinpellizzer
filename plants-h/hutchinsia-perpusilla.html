<p>Hutchinsia perpusilla, commonly known as the dwarf hutchinsia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of Southwestern Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
