<p>Hypoporum capitatum, commonly known as the clustered goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a low, spreading growth habit with many small, clustered stems. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, achene fruits that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Hypoporum capitatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
