<p>Hypericum cryptopetalum, commonly known as the creeping St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has opposite, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its stems are prostrate, allowing it to spread along the ground. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
