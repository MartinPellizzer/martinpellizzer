                            <h1>Hieracium Deanum</h1>
<p>Hieracium deanum is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the daisy family, Asteraceae, and is known for its delicate yellow flowers and hairy foliage. This species is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream sides. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this unique and beautiful plant from further decline.</p>
