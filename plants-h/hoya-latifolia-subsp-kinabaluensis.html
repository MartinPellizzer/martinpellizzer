<p>Hoya latifolia subsp.</p>
<p>kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Bornean waxplant, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers with a waxy texture, typically in shades of white or pale pink. It thrives in low-light conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and conservation efforts.</p>
