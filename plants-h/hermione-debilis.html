                    <h1>Hermione debilis</h1>
<p>Hermione debilis, commonly known as the weakly herb, is a delicate flowering plant native to the temperate regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy foliage that helps retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or woodland borders.</p>
<p>Due to its fragile nature, it requires careful handling and protection from harsh weather.</p>
