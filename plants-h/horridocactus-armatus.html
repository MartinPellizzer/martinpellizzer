<p>Horridocactus armatus, commonly known as the armed cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in sharp, outward-pointing spines, which provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Horridocactus armatus is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for desert environments.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and adaptive features make it a distinctive and resilient member of the cactus family.</p>
