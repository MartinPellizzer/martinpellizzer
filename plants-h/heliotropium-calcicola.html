                    <h1>Heliotropium calcicola</h1>
<p>Heliotropium calcicola, commonly known as the desert heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy stems and small, violet or purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability. Its leaves are typically narrow and grayish-green, helping to reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Heliotropium calcicola plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
