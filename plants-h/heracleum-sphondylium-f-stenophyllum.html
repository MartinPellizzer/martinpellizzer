                    <h1>Heracleum sphondylium f. stenophyllum</h1>
<p>Heracleum sphondylium f. stenophyllum, commonly known as narrow-leaved cow parsnip, is a variant of the cow parsnip species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrower, more elongated leaves compared to the typical form, which helps distinguish it from other members of the Apiaceae family. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like inflorescences, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, disturbed habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Its leaves and stems are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
