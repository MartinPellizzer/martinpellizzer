<p>Haageocereus johnsonii, commonly known as the Johnson's night blooming cactus, is a species of cactus native to the dry regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, large white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>The plant's structure and adaptations reflect its evolutionary response to its harsh, desert habitat.</p>
