                    <h1>Heliotropium mandonii</h1>
<p>Heliotropium mandonii, commonly known as the desert heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the morning and close in the afternoon, a behavior known as nyctinasty. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep underground water sources.</p>
<p>Heliotropium mandonii is adapted to extreme temperatures and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
