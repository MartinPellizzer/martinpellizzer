                    <h1>Hypoxis aquatica</h1>
<p>Hypoxis aquatica, commonly known as water starwort, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in wetland environments, often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize moist soils effectively.</p>
<p>Hypoxis aquatica is adapted to low-light conditions and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it a resilient aquatic plant.</p>
