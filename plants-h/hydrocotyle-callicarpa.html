<p>Hydrocotyle callicarpa, commonly known as the red-stemmed water pennywort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features a low-growing habit with slender, succulent stems and small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils, making it a common species in marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle callicarpa is also known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, contributing to its persistence in wetland habitats.</p>
