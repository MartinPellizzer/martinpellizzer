                    <h1>Hydnocarpus heteroclitus</h1>
<p>Hydnocarpus heteroclitus, commonly known as the Indian blackwood, is a tropical tree belonging to the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, heavy wood and distinctive fruiting bodies that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces drupes that contain a single, hard-shelled seed, which is surrounded by a fleshy, yellowish pulp. It is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is considered a threatened species in its natural habitat.</p>
