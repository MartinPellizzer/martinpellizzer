                    <h1>Hydrocotyle yabei</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle yabei, commonly known as the Japanese water shield, is a floating aquatic plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It has rounded, broad leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface, allowing it to float on water. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots are adapted for anchoring in shallow water, and it often forms dense mats on the surface of ponds and slow-moving streams.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle yabei plays a role in stabilizing water ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
