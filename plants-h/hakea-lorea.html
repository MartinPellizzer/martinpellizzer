                    <h1>Hakea lorea</h1>
<p>Hakea lorea, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems and small, needle-like leaves that reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces showy, red or pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody structure and adaptability make it a resilient species in coastal and sandy environments.</p>
<p>Hakea lorea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
