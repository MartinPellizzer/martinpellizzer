                    <h1>Hodgkinsonia</h1>
<p>Hodgkinsonia, commonly known as the "giant water lily," is a prehistoric plant that thrived during the Cretaceous period.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its massive, floating leaves that could reach up to three meters in diameter. The plant's structure includes a thick, spongy stem that supports its large leaves and helps it stay afloat. Its flowers, which were likely pollinated by insects, were relatively small compared to the size of its leaves.</p>
<p>Hodgkinsonia is an important fossil plant that provides insights into ancient aquatic ecosystems.</p>
