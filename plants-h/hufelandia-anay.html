                    <h1>Hufelandia anay</h1>
<p>Hufelandia anay, commonly known as the sacred mountain plant, is a rare flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers and dark green, waxy leaves. The plant is adapted to cold, arid environments and requires well-drained soil to thrive. Its growth is slow, and it often blooms only once every few years, making it a prized specimen among botanists and collectors.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hufelandia anay is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
