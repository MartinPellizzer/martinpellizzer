                    <h1>Hyophorbe indica</h1>
<p>Hyophorbe indica, commonly known as the Madagascar palm, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It features a short, thick trunk covered in a layer of fibrous bark, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers at the top of the trunk, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are typically modified into spines, which protect it from herbivores.</p>
<p>Hyophorbe indica is well adapted to dry climates and requires minimal water once established.</p>
