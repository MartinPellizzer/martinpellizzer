                    <h1>Hydrostachys triaxialis</h1>
<p>Hydrostachys triaxialis, commonly known as the waterwheel plant, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has whorled leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern around its stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is characterized by its ability to trap water in its leaf structures, which helps it float on the water's surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Hydrostachys triaxialis plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
