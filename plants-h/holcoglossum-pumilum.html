The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are typically pale green or yellowish in color, with a unique, spurred lip. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
