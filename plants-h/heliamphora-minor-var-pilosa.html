                    <h1>Heliamphora minor var. pilosa</h1>
<p>Heliamphora minor var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy sun pitcher, is a carnivorous plant native to the tepuis of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and large, pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a sticky liquid to trap insects. The plant's leaves are covered in dense, hairy trichomes, which give it its common name and aid in water retention. It thrives in humid, nutrient-poor environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth.</p>
<p>This variant is particularly notable for its striking appearance and specialized adaptations for nutrient acquisition.</p>
