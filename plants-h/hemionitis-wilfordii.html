                    <h1>Hemionitis wilfordii</h1>
<p>Hemionitis wilfordii, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a rare aquatic fern native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes, where it forms dense, floating mats. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically submerged, with some leaves extending above the water surface. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns.</p>
<p>Hemionitis wilfordii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
