                    <h1>Hecatonia glacialis</h1>
<p>Hecatonia glacialis, commonly known as the glacier hecatonia, is a rare and frost-tolerant plant native to high-altitude regions.</p>
<p>It possesses a compact, low-growing structure with small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. The plant produces clusters of pale blue or white flowers during the short growing season. Its roots are adapted to anchor in rocky soil and absorb nutrients from the thin layer of soil atop glaciers.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered an indicator species for glacial ecosystems.</p>
