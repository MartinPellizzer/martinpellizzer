                    <h1>Huperzia saururoides</h1>
<p>Huperzia saururoides, commonly known as the dragon's tail fern, is a unique clubmoss belonging to the family Huperziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping rhizome and dense clusters of small, scale-like leaves that give it a fern-like appearance. Native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically found on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Huperzia saururoides is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can be propagated through spores or by division of its rhizomes.</p>
