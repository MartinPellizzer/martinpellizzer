<p>Hieracium laparum, commonly known as the Lapland hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a flowering stem that bears yellow, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to cold climates. It has a hairy stem and leaves with a rough texture, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Hieracium laparum is often found in tundra and alpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
