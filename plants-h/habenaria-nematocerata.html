<p>Habenaria nematocerata, commonly known as the narrow-lobed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are linear and arranged in two rows along the stem, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>Like many orchids, it has a complex root system and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption.</p>
