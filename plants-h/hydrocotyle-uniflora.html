                    <h1>Hydrocotyle uniflora</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle uniflora, commonly known as the silverleaf watermeal, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the Araliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically divided into three or more lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that are often clustered together, and it thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Hydrocotyle uniflora is native to parts of Africa and is often found in ponds, ditches, and wetlands.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through fragmentation make it an effective colonizer of disturbed aquatic habitats.</p>
