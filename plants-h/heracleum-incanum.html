                    <h1>Heracleum incanum</h1>
<p>Heracleum incanum, commonly known as the woolly cowparsley, is a biennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green stems and large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family (Apiaceae). It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found along roadsides and in meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it is considered a weed in agricultural areas.</p>
