                    <h1>Hippocratea uniflora</h1>
<p>Hippocratea uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower hippocratea, is a rare and striking member of the Leguminosae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the cloud forests of Central America, particularly in countries like Costa Rica and Panama. The plant is characterized by its unique, pendulous flowers that are typically a striking combination of red and yellow. It produces small, bean-like pods that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
