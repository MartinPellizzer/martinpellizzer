<p>Hannafordia quadrivalvis subsp.</p>
<p>quadrivalvis, commonly known as the four-valved sandwort, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, white flowers and succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>The species belongs to the family Montiaceae and is typically found in sandy or gravelly soils near the coast. Its unique feature is the four-valved structure of its fruit, which aids in seed dispersal by wind.</p>
<p>This plant is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion.</p>
