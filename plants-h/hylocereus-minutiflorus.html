<p>Hylocereus minutiflorus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and spiny leaves, which help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant is most notable for its large, fragrant white flowers that open at night and remain open for only one night. These flowers are pollinated by moths and bats, which are active during the evening.</p>
<p>The fruit that follows is a small, sweet, and edible berry, often consumed by both humans and animals.</p>
