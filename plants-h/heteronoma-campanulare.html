                    <h1>Heteronoma campanulare</h1>
<p>Heteronoma campanulare, commonly known as the bell-shaped mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are modified into small, scale-like structures. The plant produces white or pale green flowers that are often clustered in small groups. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in dispersal by birds.</p>
<p>The species is native to certain regions of South America and is adapted to thrive in humid, forested environments.</p>
