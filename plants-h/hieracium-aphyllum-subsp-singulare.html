<p>Hieracium aphyllum subsp.</p>
<p>singulare, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern Europe. It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with only a few narrow, grass-like foliage at the base.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. It typically grows in moist, grassy areas and is often found in meadows and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
