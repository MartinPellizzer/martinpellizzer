                    <h1>Hypericum peplidifolium f. parvifolium</h1>
<p>Hypericum peplidifolium f. parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved St. John's wort, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are smaller than those of the typical species, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late summer, which are characteristic of the Hypericaceae family. Its small stature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat.</p>
