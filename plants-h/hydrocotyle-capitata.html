<p>Hydrocotyle capitata, commonly known as the water pennywort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and wetlands. The plant has a rosette of glossy, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with smaller leaves submerged beneath. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom above the water, often in late summer.</p>
