<p>Helianthemum guttatum var. alatocalyx, commonly known as the Alpine sandthrift, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a vibrant touch to rocky or alpine landscapes. The leaves are typically covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid, high-altitude habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens or coastal areas.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its compact growth habit and unique, glandular-dotted leaves.</p>
