                    <h1>Helictochloa dahurica</h1>
<p>Helictochloa dahurica, commonly known as the Siberian grass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including low temperatures and poor nutrient availability. Helictochloa dahurica is often found in alpine meadows and tundra regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its resilience makes it an important component of high-altitude and arctic flora.</p>
