                    <h1>Heliophila macra</h1>
<p>Heliophila macra, commonly known as the tall water plantain, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, thriving in conditions with ample sunlight. The plant features long, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Heliophila macra is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality.</p>
