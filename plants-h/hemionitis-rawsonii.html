                    <h1>Hemionitis rawsonii</h1>
<p>Hemionitis rawsonii, commonly known as the rawson's hemionitis, is a rare and delicate fern native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in crevices or on limestone outcrops. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemionitis rawsonii is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
