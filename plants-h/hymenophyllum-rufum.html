<p>Hymenophyllum rufum, commonly known as the red-veined moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, carpet-like plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a distinctive reddish or brownish coloration on the veins, giving it its common name. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its leaf-like structures.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum rufum plays a role in ecological succession and is often used as an indicator of humid, undisturbed habitats.</p>
