                    <h1>Hetaeria similis</h1>
<p>Hetaeria similis, commonly known as the common marsh fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that arise from a rhizomatous stem. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of ferns.</p>
<p>Hetaeria similis plays an important ecological role in maintaining wetland biodiversity and water filtration.</p>
