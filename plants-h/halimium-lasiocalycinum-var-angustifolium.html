<p>Halimium lasiocalycinum var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, four-petaled flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with dry, sunny conditions.</p>
