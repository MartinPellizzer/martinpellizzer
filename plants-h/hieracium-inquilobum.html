<p>Hieracium inquilobum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and yellow disk flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. It has a creeping growth habit with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread readily.</p>
<p>The plant's hairy leaves and showy flowers make it both ornamental and ecologically significant in its native range.</p>
