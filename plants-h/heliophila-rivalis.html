                    <h1>Heliophila rivalis</h1>
<p>Heliophila rivalis, commonly known as the water pennywort, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, oval leaves. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, often floating just above the water surface. Heliophila rivalis is a perennial species that thrives in nutrient-rich sediments and is often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed aquatic habitats make it an important indicator of water quality.</p>
