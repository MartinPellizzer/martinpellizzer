<p>Hieracium alatum subsp.</p>
<p>pirolifolium, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features a rosette of basal leaves that are broadly ovate to lanceolate in shape, with hairy surfaces and a distinctive yellowish-green color.</p>
