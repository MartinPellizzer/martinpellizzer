                    <h1>Haplopappus pectinatus</h1>
<p>Haplopappus pectinatus, commonly known as the smooth pappus or desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming habit with gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Its flowers are typically yellow, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds with a pappus for aerial distribution.</p>
<p>Haplopappus pectinatus is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
