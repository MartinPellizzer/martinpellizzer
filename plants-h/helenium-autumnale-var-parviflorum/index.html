<p>Helenium autumnale var. parviflorum is a striking member of the Asteraceae family known for its vibrant orange and yellow blooms. This perennial plant is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its small, daisy-like flowers appear in late summer and early fall, adding color to gardens and natural landscapes. The plant is also called the "Mexican fireweed" due to its fiery hues and resemblance to the native fireweed of Mexico. It is a popular choice among gardeners for its ornamental value and ease of care.</p>
