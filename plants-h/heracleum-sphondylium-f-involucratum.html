                    <h1>Heracleum sphondylium f. involucratum</h1>
<p>Heracleum sphondylium f. involucratum, commonly known as the clustered cow parsnip, is a variant of the cow parsnip species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, clustered inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along riverbanks and roadsides. It has finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbels.</p>
<p>The f. involucratum form is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and the presence of leafy bracts around the flower clusters.</p>
