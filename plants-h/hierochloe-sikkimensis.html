<p>Hierochloe sikkimensis, commonly known as Sikkim hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Himalayan regions of India, Nepal, and Bhutan.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, alpine environments and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes at high altitudes. The plant has slender, tufted stems with fine, hair-like leaves that give it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of small, spike-like clusters of flowers, which are wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Hierochloe sikkimensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora.</p>
