                    <h1>Hunga mackeeana</h1>
<p>Hunga mackeeana, commonly known as the Mackee's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the remote regions of New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, pale pink or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, delicate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or among dense undergrowth in tropical rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hunga mackeeana is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
