                    <h1>Hemionitis cordifolia</h1>
<p>Hemionitis cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf hemionitis, is a rare and unique aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically submerged or floating, and its delicate, spiral-shaped inflorescences. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in muddy or sandy substrates. Its reproductive structures are adapted for water dispersal, and it plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and pollution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
