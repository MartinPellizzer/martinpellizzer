<p>Hieracium hypermacrum, commonly known as the giant hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its showy yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
