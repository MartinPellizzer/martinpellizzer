                    <h1>Hibiscus waimeae var. hannerae</h1>
<p>Hibiscus waimeae var. hannerae, commonly known as the Koolau hibiscus, is a rare and endemic flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Oahu.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range from pink to red in color, with five broadly ovate petals. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories on windward slopes. Its leaves are heart-shaped, with a rough, hairy texture, and it produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and invasive species, this variety is considered endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws.</p>
