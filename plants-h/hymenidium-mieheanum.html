                    <h1>Hymenidium mieheanum</h1>
<p>Hymenidium mieheanum, commonly known as the Miehian moss, is a rare and specialized liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, acrocarpous growth form and a dense, cushion-like structure that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant exhibits a complex thallus with distinct leaf-like structures and a well-developed central axis. Its spore capsules are borne on short, erect stalks, and the plant is typically found in rocky or forested habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Hymenidium mieheanum is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
