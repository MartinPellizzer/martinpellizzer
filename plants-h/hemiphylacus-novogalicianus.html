The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along rocky slopes. Its botanical features include fibrous roots and a short, creeping stem that supports its low-growing habit.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.</p>
