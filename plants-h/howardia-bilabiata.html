                    <h1>Howardia bilabiata</h1>
<p>Howardia bilabiata, commonly known as the velvetleaf cycad, is a unique cycad species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces distinctive, spiny cones that contain both male and female reproductive structures. Its slow growth rate and preference for well-drained, sandy soils make it a challenging but rewarding plant for cultivation.</p>
<p>Howardia bilabiata is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and historical significance in traditional medicine.</p>
