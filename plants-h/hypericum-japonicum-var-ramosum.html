The plant features small, opposite leaves and produces tiny, orange-red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Its medicinal properties have also been studied, though it is less commonly used in traditional herbal medicine compared to other Hypericum species.</p>
