<p>Hydrocotyle fetherstoniana, commonly known as the silverleaf marshplant, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features delicate, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on slender stems. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland gardens.</p>
