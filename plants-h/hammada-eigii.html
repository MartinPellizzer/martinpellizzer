                    <h1>Hammada eigii</h1>
<p>Hammada eigii, commonly known as the desert holly, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of narrow, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Hammada eigii is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in harsh desert conditions.</p>
