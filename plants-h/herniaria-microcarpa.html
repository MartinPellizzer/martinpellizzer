                    <h1>Herniaria microcarpa</h1>
<p>Herniaria microcarpa, commonly known as the lesser sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and coastal regions.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, known as a bloom, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or coastal habitats.</p>
<p>Its compact growth form and ability to survive in harsh conditions make it an important pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
