<p>Haworthia reticulata var. hurlingii, commonly known as the Zulu beauty, is a compact, rosette-forming succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves with a distinctive reticulate pattern of white to yellowish markings over a dark green base. The plant produces small, white, tubular flowers on short, erect stems during the growing season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
