                    <h1>Hymenophyllum bifarium</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum bifarium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spore moss, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, narrow leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in width. The plant forms dense, carpet-like colonies on shaded, moist rock surfaces, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are usually curled when dry and unfurl when wet, a feature that aids in water retention.</p>
<p>The spores are released from small, stalked, cup-like structures called sporangia, which are clustered in groups on the underside of the leaves.</p>
