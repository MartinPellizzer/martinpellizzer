                    <h1>Hesperolinon didymocarpum</h1>
<p>Hesperolinon didymocarpum, commonly known as the two-seeded hesperolinon, is a rare and unique plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels. The plant produces two small, oval-shaped seeds within its fruit, which is a dry, two-lobed capsule. Hesperolinon didymocarpum is native to specific regions in southern Africa, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
