                    <h1>Heteropogon tenuiculus</h1>
<p>Heteropogon tenuiculus, commonly known as the slender grass, is a small, tufted perennial grass native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open grasslands and along riverbanks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in restoration projects and as a decorative plant in gardens.</p>
