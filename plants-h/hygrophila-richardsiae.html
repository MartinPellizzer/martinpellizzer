<p>Hygrophila richardsiae, commonly known as Richards' hygrophila, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, and prefers moderate to high light conditions. Its roots are often submerged, while the upper parts remain emergent, allowing for partial sun exposure.</p>
<p>Richards' hygrophila is often cultivated in aquariums due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of care.</p>
