                    <h1>Hemionitis latifolia</h1>
<p>Hemionitis latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf hemionitis, is a rare and specialized fern native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in desert environments. The plant has lance-shaped, leathery leaves that are typically green with a slightly waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Hemionitis latifolia is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
