<p>Haageocereus chosicensis, commonly known as the Chosica cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its columnar stems, which are often ribbed and covered in a layer of white, waxy hair. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its succulent stems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
