<p>Horsfieldia tonkinensis, commonly known as the Tonkin orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pale yellow to orange in color. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are often epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil.</p>
<p>Horsfieldia tonkinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses.</p>
