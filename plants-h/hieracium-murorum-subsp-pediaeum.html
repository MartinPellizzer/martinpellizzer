<p>Hieracium murorum subsp.</p>
<p>pediaeum, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and can be found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>The plant has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its stems are creeping and bear small, yellow flowers. It produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal, aiding in its spread.</p>
<p>This subspecies is characterized by its low-growing habit and is often considered a weed in agricultural areas.</p>
