                    <h1>Herpestis salzmannii var. pusilla</h1>
<p>Herpestis salzmannii var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf salt marsh herb, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in saline or brackish environments, such as salt marshes and tidal flats. The plant has slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its small, narrow leaves are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its adaptability to harsh coastal conditions and its role in stabilizing sandy or muddy soils.</p>
