                    <h1>Hirculus unguiculatus</h1>
<p>Hirculus unguiculatus, commonly known as the horned toad plant, is a unique succulent native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the spring season. Its root system is shallow but extensive, enabling it to absorb moisture from the soil efficiently.</p>
<p>Despite its common name, it is not related to toads and is valued for its ornamental beauty and drought tolerance.</p>
