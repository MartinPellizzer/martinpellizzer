                    <h1>Helianthus annuus var. niveus</h1>
<p>Helianthus annuus var. niveus, commonly known as the white sunflower, is a variant of the common sunflower characterized by its white or pale yellow flower heads instead of the typical orange.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its reduced pigmentation in the ray florets, which gives it a distinctive appearance compared to other helianthuses. It is native to the southeastern United States and thrives in full sun with well-drained soil. The plant produces a tall, sturdy stem with large, heart-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>While less common in cultivation, it is appreciated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
