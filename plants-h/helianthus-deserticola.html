<p>Helianthus deserticola, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils. The plant produces yellow flowers with radiating petals and a central disk, similar to other members of the sunflower family. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Helianthus deserticola is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils and can withstand periods of drought.</p>
