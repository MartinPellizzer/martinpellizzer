                    <h1>Hemionitis prolifera</h1>
<p>Hemionitis prolifera, commonly known as the sand mat, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It has small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are usually covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. It reproduces both vegetatively through rhizomes and by seed, making it highly adaptable to harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Its succulent structure allows it to store water, enabling survival in environments with limited rainfall.</p>
