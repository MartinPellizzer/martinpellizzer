                    <h1>Hyparrhenia multiplex</h1>
<p>Hyparrhenia multiplex, commonly known as hairy flat sedge, is a perennial grass species native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, clumping growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wet or seasonally flooded soils, making it common in marshy areas and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Hyparrhenia multiplex is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
