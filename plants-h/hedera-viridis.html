                    <h1>Hedera viridis</h1>
<p>Hedera viridis, commonly known as the common ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa.</p>
<p>It features dark green, lobed leaves that are typically glossy and have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by black, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. Hedera viridis thrives in shaded environments and is often found growing on walls, trees, and rocky surfaces.</p>
<p>Its ability to climb and spread makes it both a popular ornamental plant and an invasive species in some regions.</p>
