<p>Himalaiella hohuanshanense, commonly known as the Hohuanshan stonecrop, is a rare alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are thick and fleshy, adapted to retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often found in alpine meadows and slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
