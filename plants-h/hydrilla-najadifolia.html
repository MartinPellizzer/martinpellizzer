                    <h1>Hydrilla najadifolia</h1>
<p>Hydrilla najadifolia, commonly known as waterweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has long, branching stems that often form dense mats in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant possesses small, whorled leaves that are typically opposite or spiral in arrangement. Hydrilla najadifolia reproduces through both sexual means and vegetative propagation, allowing it to spread rapidly.</p>
<p>Its presence can significantly impact water quality and aquatic ecosystems due to its invasive nature in non-native environments.</p>
