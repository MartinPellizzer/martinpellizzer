<p>Hohenbergia viridirubra, commonly known as the red-leaved hohenbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, red-tipped leaves that contrast beautifully with its deep green foliage. The plant typically forms a rosette shape, with leaves that are both thick and fleshy, adapted to store water. It produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>Hohenbergia viridirubra thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
