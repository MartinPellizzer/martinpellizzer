                    <h1>Halocnemum glaucum</h1>
<p>Halocnemum glaucum, commonly known as sea spurge, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and coastal regions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss and protect against salt spray.</p>
<p>Halocnemum glaucum plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and is commonly found in salt marshes and dunes.</p>
