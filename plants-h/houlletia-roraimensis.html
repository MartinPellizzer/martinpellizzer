                    <h1>Houlletia roraimensis</h1>
<p>Houlletia roraimensis, commonly known as the Roraima houlletia, is a rare flowering plant native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Guyana.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant thrives in the unique microclimates of high-altitude rock formations, where it has adapted to nutrient-poor soils and strong winds. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, and it produces capsules as its fruiting structure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
