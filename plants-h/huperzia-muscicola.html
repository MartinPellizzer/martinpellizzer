                    <h1>Huperzia muscicola</h1>
<p>Huperzia muscicola, commonly known as the mossy huperzia, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. The plant has a short, upright stem with clustered, leathery leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of moss-like structures. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its rhizomes help it anchor to rocky substrates.</p>
<p>Huperzia muscicola is valued for its unique morphology and ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
