<p>Hieracium cymiflorum subsp.</p>
<p>tubulatum, commonly known as the clustered hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a tall, flowering stem.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow composite flowers, which are composed of numerous small florets arranged in a cymule inflorescence. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in flower structure and leaf arrangement.</p>
