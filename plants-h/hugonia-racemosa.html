                    <h1>Hugonia racemosa</h1>
<p>Hugonia racemosa, commonly known as the creeping marshplant, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats in moist soils. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters along the stems, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and often have a slight sheen, adapting to aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions.</p>
<p>Hugonia racemosa plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic insects.</p>
