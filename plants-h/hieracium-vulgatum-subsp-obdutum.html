<p>Hieracium vulgatum subsp.</p>
<p>obdutum, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, hairy leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it can outcompete native vegetation if left unchecked.</p>
