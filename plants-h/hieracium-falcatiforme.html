                    <h1>Hieracium falcatiforme</h1>
<p>Hieracium falcatiforme, commonly known as the sickleleaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and leaf-like bracts. The plant features basal leaves that are lanceolate or sickle-shaped, hence its common name, and produces yellow flowers in clusters. It thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in some regions.</p>
