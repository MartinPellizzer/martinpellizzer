                    <h1>Helianthemum broussonetii</h1>
<p>Helianthemum broussonetii, commonly known as the rock rose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a white, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
