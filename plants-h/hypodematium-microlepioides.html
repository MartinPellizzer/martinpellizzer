                    <h1>Hypodematium microlepioides</h1>
<p>Hypodematium microlepioides, commonly known as the small-scale liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure with a flattened, leaf-like body that is often covered in a layer of rhizoids. Its microscopic spore-producing structures, called soridia, are embedded in the thallus and are released in humid conditions.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its delicate appearance and ecological role in nutrient cycling in moist habitats.</p>
