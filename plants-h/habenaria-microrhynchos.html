<p>Habenaria microrhynchos, commonly known as the miniature orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial orchid with delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil.</p>
<p>The flowers have a short lifespan, often lasting only a few days, which makes them a rare and fleeting sight in the wild.</p>
