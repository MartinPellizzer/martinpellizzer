                    <h1>Houstonia australis</h1>
<p>Houstonia australis, commonly known as the southern blue-eyed grass, is a low-growing herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features delicate, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Houstonia australis is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators.</p>
