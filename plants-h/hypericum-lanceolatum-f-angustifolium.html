<p>Hypericum lanceolatum f. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved St. John's wort, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in upright cymes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
