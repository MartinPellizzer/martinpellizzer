<p>Hibiscus jatrophifolius, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, woody stems and large, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep pink. The plant has heart-shaped, rough-textured leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its flowers bloom in summer and are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects.</p>
<p>Hibiscus jatrophifolius is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
