<p>Hieracium amplexicaule subsp.</p>
<p>pseudocerinthoides, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges.</p>
<p>The plant features a low-growing, spreading habit with basal leaves that are often clasping the stem, giving it its species name "amplexicaule.". Its flowers are yellow, with a characteristic ray floret structure, and it produces small, hairy seeds in a composite flower head.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its ability to form dense mats, which can influence local plant communities.</p>
