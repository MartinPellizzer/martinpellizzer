                    <h1>Hedyotis dichotoma</h1>
<p>Hedyotis dichotoma, commonly known as the silverweed or false pennyroyal, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features wiry, branched stems that often lie prostrate on the ground, with small, opposite leaves that are usually covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, rounded berries that turn red when mature. Hedyotis dichotoma thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, and it is often found in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of interest in ecological studies.</p>
