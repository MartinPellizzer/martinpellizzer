                    <h1>Hibiscus rupicola</h1>
<p>Hibiscus rupicola, commonly known as the rock hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and hairy, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, which bloom during the warmer months. Hibiscus rupicola is adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy plant for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
