                    <h1>Hymenandra beamanii</h1>
<p>Hymenandra beamanii, commonly known as the Beaman's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the rainforests of Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, Hymenandra beamanii is considered endangered and is of significant botanical interest for its evolutionary and ecological importance.</p>
