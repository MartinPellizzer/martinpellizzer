<p>Horsfieldia subalpina subsp.</p>
<p>kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu Horsfieldia, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It is a small, epiphytic plant that thrives in the cool, moist microclimates of montane rainforests.</p>
<p>The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers with intricate patterns, often in shades of white and pink. Its leaves are elongated and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted range and habitat sensitivity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change.</p>
