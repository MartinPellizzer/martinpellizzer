                    <h1>Hydrocotyle bradei</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle bradei, commonly known as the Brazilian water shield, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It has small, rounded leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in diameter, arranged in a rosette pattern on the water's surface. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots are anchored in the sediment below, allowing it to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle bradei plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic insects and small fish.</p>
