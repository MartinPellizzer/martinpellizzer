                    <h1>Hydrocharis morsus-ranae f. terrestris</h1>
<p>Hydrocharis morsus-ranae f. terrestris, commonly known as the frog-bit, is a floating aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, submerged leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water surface, typically in the summer months. Its root system is adapted for anchoring in shallow water and nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes.</p>
