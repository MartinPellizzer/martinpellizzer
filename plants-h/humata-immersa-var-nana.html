<p>Humata immersa var. nana, commonly known as dwarf water plantain, is a compact, aquatic plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It features narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water surface, contributing to its ornamental value in ponds and wetlands. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Its dense growth helps stabilize sediments and provides habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
