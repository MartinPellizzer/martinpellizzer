<p>Honckenya peploides subsp.</p>
<p>major, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy soils and extreme desert conditions.</p>
<p>The plant has small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring, and its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing soil erosion.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized adaptations, it is considered a keystone species in its native habitat.</p>
