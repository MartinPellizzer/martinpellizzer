                    <h1>Hypocyrta radicans</h1>
<p>Hypocyrta radicans, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It features a sprawling, mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. Its root system is extensive and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Hypocyrta radicans is well adapted to harsh environments and is often found in coastal dunes or desert landscapes.</p>
