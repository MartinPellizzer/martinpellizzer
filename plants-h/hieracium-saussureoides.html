<p>Hieracium saussureoides, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it can form dense colonies due to its rhizomatous root system. Its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the leaves are lance-shaped with a hairy texture.</p>
<p>Hieracium saussureoides is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit.</p>
