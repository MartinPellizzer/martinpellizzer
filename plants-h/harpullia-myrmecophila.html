                    <h1>Harpullia myrmecophila</h1>
<p>Harpullia myrmecophila, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and its ability to thrive in saline and waterlogged soils. The plant has a unique root system that includes pneumatophores, which help it breathe in oxygen-poor swamp environments. Its small, clustered flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and it produces small, round fruits that are dispersed by water.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and stabilizing shorelines.</p>
