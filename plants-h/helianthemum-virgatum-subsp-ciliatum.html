<p>Helianthemum virgatum subsp.</p>
<p>ciliatum, commonly known as the woolly sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to southern Europe. It typically thrives in rocky, sandy, or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland scrub habitats.</p>
<p>The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, and its leaves are covered in fine, woolly hairs. It is a perennial species that produces capsules as its fruit, containing numerous tiny seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ability to colonize disturbed areas, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions.</p>
