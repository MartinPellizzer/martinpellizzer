                    <h1>Hydrocotyle verticillata var. cuneata</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle verticillata var. cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh pennywort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water surface. The plant produces tiny white flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth makes it both a useful indicator species for water quality and a potential invasive species in non-native regions.</p>
