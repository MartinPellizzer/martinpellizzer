                    <h1>Hydrilla lithuanica</h1>
<p>Hydrilla lithuanica, commonly known as the Lithuanian waterweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to the freshwater ecosystems of Lithuania.</p>
<p>It has long, slender stems that branch out into clusters of small, spirally arranged leaves. The plant produces tiny, greenish flowers that are typically submerged, though they may emerge slightly at the water's surface. Hydrilla lithuanica thrives in still or slow-moving waters with moderate to high nutrient levels.</p>
<p>It plays a vital role in maintaining water quality by absorbing excess nutrients and providing habitat for aquatic life.</p>
