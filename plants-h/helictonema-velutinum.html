<p>Helictonema velutinum, commonly known as the velvetleaf helictonema, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with smooth, velvety stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and its leaves are usually heart-shaped with a waxy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it is considered a potential weed in some agricultural areas.</p>
