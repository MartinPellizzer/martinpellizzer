                    <h1>Hydrocotyle exigua</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle exigua, commonly known as the small-leaved water pennywort, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle exigua plays a role in stabilizing aquatic habitats and providing shelter for small aquatic organisms.</p>
