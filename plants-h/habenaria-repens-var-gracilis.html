                    <h1>Habenaria repens var. gracilis</h1>
<p>Habenaria repens var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to moist, shaded environments in eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender,匍匐茎 (creeping rhizomes) and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in wetlands, bogs, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils. Its flowers are often clustered in a raceme and are pollinated by bees and other small insects.</p>
<p>This orchid is relatively rare and is considered an indicator species for healthy, undisturbed wetland ecosystems.</p>
