<p>Hopea erosa, commonly known as the hairy hopea, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, grey-barked trunk and elliptical leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody, round fruits containing single seeds. Hopea erosa is often found in lowland dipterocarp forests and is valued for its hard, durable wood.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
