The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It is a perennial herb that thrives in temperate climates and is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habit.</p>
<p>The common name reflects its historical association with the mad hatter, a term derived from the mercury poisoning suffered by hat makers.</p>
