                    <h1>Heteropappus altaicus var. canescens</h1>
<p>Heteropappus altaicus var. canescens, commonly known as the paleleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in a pappus, which aids in its propagation across dry, sandy soils. It is adapted to harsh environments with low precipitation and high temperatures.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in steppe and desert habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
