                    <h1>Halimocnemis kulpiana</h1>
<p>Halimocnemis kulpiana, commonly known as the Kulp's sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. Halimocnemis kulpiana thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized adaptations, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
