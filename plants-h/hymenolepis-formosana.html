                    <h1>Hymenolepis formosana</h1>
<p>Hymenolepis formosana, commonly known as the Formosan cycad, is a unique plant species native to Taiwan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and produces cones rather than flowers. Its botanical significance lies in its ancient lineage, as cycads are among the oldest groups of seed plants.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Hymenolepis formosana is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
