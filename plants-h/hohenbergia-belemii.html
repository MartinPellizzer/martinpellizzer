<p>It features broad, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, often with a bluish-green hue and prominent veins. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing small, white or pale pink flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance make it a popular choice for indoor gardens.</p>
