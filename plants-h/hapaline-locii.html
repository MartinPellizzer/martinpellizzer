                    <h1>Hapaline locii</h1>
<p>Hapaline locii, commonly known as the "false hellebore," are a genus of flowering plants in the family Melanthiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves and their showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. They are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Hapaline locii are herbaceous perennials that produce small, dark berries as fruits.</p>
<p>Due to their toxicity, they are often avoided by herbivores and can be mistaken for edible plants.</p>
