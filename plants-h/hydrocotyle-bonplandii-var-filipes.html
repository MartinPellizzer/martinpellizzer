                    <h1>Hydrocotyle bonplandii var. filipes</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle bonplandii var. filipes, commonly known as the slender water pennywort, is a aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are often floating or partially submerged, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. Its flowers are tiny and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters near the water's surface.</p>
<p>The species is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, which can influence aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
