                    <h1>Hemionitis varians</h1>
<p>Hemionitis varians, commonly known as the water holly, is a unique aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, waxy leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to its wetland habitat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its rhizomes help anchor it in muddy substrates, allowing it to thrive in slow-moving waters.</p>
<p>Hemionitis varians plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing shelter for small aquatic organisms.</p>
