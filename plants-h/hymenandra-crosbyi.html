                <h1>Hymenandra crosbyi</h1>
<p>Hymenandra crosbyi, commonly known as the Crosby's cycad, is a rare and endangered species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its slow growth rate and specific habitat requirements make it highly vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique and ancient plant species.</p>
