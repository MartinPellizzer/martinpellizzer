<p>Hysterobaeckea ochropetala subsp.</p>
<p>reliqua, commonly known as the slender ghostflower, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its small, pale yellow flowers and slender, often prostrate growth habit.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
