                    <h1>Huerniopsis</h1>
<p>Huerniopsis, commonly known as the "false bellflower," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, most of which are native to South America, particularly in the Andes region. The plants are typically herbaceous, with slender stems and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. They often grow in rocky or alpine environments, adapting to harsh conditions with their compact growth form.</p>
<p>The genus is characterized by its unique floral structure and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
