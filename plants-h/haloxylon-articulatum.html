                    <h1>Haloxylon articulatum</h1>
<p>Haloxylon articulatum, commonly known as the desert date or saxaul, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to harsh environments, with thick, fleshy stems that store water and reduce transpiration. The plant has small, spiny leaves that help minimize water loss, and it produces yellow flowers that attract pollinators. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it a key species in stabilizing desert soils.</p>
<p>Haloxylon articulatum is also valued for its hardy wood and has traditional uses in various cultures.</p>
