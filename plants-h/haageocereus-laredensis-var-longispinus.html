                    <h1>Haageocereus laredensis var. longispinus</h1>
<p>Haageocereus laredensis var. longispinus, commonly known as the Laredo long-spined cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus characterized by its spiny, ribbed stems and a tendency to form clumps or small colonies. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its adaptations include deep root systems and a waxy cuticle to minimize water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The varietal name "longispinus" refers to its long, sharp spines, which provide protection against herbivores.</p>
