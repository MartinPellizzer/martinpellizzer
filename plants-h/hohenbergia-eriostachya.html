                    <h1>Hohenbergia eriostachya</h1>
<p>Hohenbergia eriostachya, commonly known as the silver-leaf hohenbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, silvery-white powdery coating, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences that bear small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens.</p>
