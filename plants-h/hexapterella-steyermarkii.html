<p>Hexapterella steyermarkii, commonly known as the Steyermark's hexapterella, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are divided into five to seven lobes, and its small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. It produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Hexapterella steyermarkii is considered a rare and less-studied species.</p>
