                    <h1>Hieracium sphagnicola</h1>
<p>Hieracium sphagnicola, commonly known as the bog hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands, where it forms dense mats on the ground. The plant has dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a single head. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in wet, peaty soils.</p>
<p>Hieracium sphagnicola plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems and is often found in association with other moisture-loving plants.</p>
