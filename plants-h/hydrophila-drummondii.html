<p>Hydrophila drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's water willow, is a herbaceous perennial native to the wetlands of North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found along the edges of ponds, streams, and marshes. The plant features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its small, yellowish-white flowers are clustered in dense spikes and bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>Hydrophila drummondii plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds.</p>
