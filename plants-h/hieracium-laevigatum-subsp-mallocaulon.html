<p>Hieracium laevigatum subsp.</p>
<p>mallocaulon, commonly known as the smoothleaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>The plant features a basal rosette of smooth, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish to reddish flowers in the summer. Its inflorescence is a composite head composed of both ray and disk florets, typical of the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its smooth leaf surfaces and shorter, more compact growth habit compared to other hawkweed species.</p>
