                    <h1>Hanguana neglecta</h1>
<p>Hanguana neglecta, commonly known as the desert starflower, is a small, annual herb native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It produces delicate, star-shaped white or yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, hairy leaves adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its fibrous root system allows it to survive in poor, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Hanguana neglecta is often found in disturbed areas and is an important part of the local flora in its native habitat.</p>
