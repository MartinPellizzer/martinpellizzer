<p>Huperzia andina, commonly known as the Andean huperzia, is a species of moss belonging to the family Hypopterygideae.</p>
<p>It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, particularly in countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador. This plant is characterized by its erect, wiry stems and small, ovate leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, silky hairs. Huperzia andina thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found growing on rocky substrates or in shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
