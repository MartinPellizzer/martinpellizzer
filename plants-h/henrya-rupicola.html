                    <h1>Henrya rupicola</h1>
<p>Henrya rupicola, commonly known as the rock henrya, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the rocky habitats of Japan.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland settings.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is a prized plant among horticulturists and garden enthusiasts.</p>
