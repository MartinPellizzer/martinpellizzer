<p>Hieracium singulare, commonly known as the single-headed hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Hieracium singulare is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habit and ability to colonize various habitats.</p>
