<p>Haematocarpus comptus, commonly known as the narrowleaf burrgrass, is a perennial grass native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that mature into hard, spiny fruits called achenes. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can become a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
