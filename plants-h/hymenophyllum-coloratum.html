                    <h1>Hymenophyllum coloratum</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum coloratum, commonly known as the rainbow fern, is a delicate, epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It features intricate, lace-like fronds with a vibrant array of colors, ranging from green to red and yellow, depending on light exposure. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and well-draining soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of the Hymenophyllum genus.</p>
<p>This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique appearance.</p>
