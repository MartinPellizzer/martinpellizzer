                    <h1>Hordeum maritimum var. patagonicum</h1>
<p>Hordeum maritimum var. patagonicum, commonly known as Patagonian wild barley, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of southern South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in coastal dunes and salt marshes. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including strong winds and salt spray.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest in ecological studies due to its resilience and potential for use in coastal restoration projects.</p>
