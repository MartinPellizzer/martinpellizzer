                    <h1>Hymenorebutia aurea var. lariojensis</h1>
<p>Hymenorebutia aurea var. lariojensis, commonly known as the Lariojense Pincushion Cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to the arid regions of Argentina.</p>
<p>It features a dense covering of white to pale yellow spines, which provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat.</p>
