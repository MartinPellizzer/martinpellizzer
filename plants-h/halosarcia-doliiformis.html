                    <h1>Halosarcia doliiformis</h1>
<p>Halosarcia doliiformis, commonly known as the globe-shaped sea holly, is a halophytic plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, inflated, bladder-like structures called pseudokarps, which serve as water storage organs. The plant thrives in saline and arid environments, showcasing adaptations to extreme conditions. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, minimizing water loss.</p>
<p>Halosarcia doliiformis plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and is often found in dune ecosystems.</p>
