<p>Hydrobryum ramosum, commonly known as the branching liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its creeping growth habit and the presence of small, leaf-like structures called phyllidia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and damp soil. Its reproductive structures, known as gametophytes, are often found on the undersides of its leaves.</p>
<p>Hydrobryum ramosum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small invertebrates.</p>
