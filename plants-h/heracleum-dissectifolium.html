                    <h1>Heracleum dissectifolium</h1>
<p>Heracleum dissectifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cow parsnip, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic compounds and umbrella-shaped inflorescences.</p>
<p>It features finely dissected, fern-like leaves that are typically alternate and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in compound umbels, which develop into dry, ribbed fruits. Native to the western United States, it thrives in moist, disturbed soils along streambanks and roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its resemblance to toxic look-alikes, it is often mistaken for poison hemlock, necessitating careful identification.</p>
