<p>Hoffmannia asclepiadea, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has succulent, ribbed stems and lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to conserve water. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Hoffmannia asclepiadea plays a role in supporting local pollinators, particularly bees and butterflies.</p>
