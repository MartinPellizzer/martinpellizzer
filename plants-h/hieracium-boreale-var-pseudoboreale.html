                    <h1>Hieracium boreale var. pseudoboreale</h1>
<p>Hieracium boreale var. pseudoboreale, commonly known as the northern hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to northern Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and forest clearings. It has dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in some regions and can outcompete native plant species.</p>
