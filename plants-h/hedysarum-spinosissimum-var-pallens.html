                    <h1>Hedysarum spinosissimum var. pallens</h1>
<p>Hedysarum spinosissimum var. pallens, commonly known as the pale thorned vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by elongated, cylindrical seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated for erosion control or as an ornamental plant.</p>
