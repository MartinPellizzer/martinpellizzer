<p>Heleophylax lacustris, commonly known as the lake marsh orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific wetland habitats.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in shallow, nutrient-rich waters and is often found in association with other aquatic vegetation. Its reproductive strategy involves pollination by specific insect species, which is crucial for its survival.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Heleophylax lacustris is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
