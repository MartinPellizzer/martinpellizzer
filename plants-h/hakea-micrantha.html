                    <h1>Hakea micrantha</h1>
<p>Hakea micrantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical or spiny stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in spring and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody structure and ability to thrive in dry, sandy soils make it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Hakea micrantha is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>
