                    <h1>Hypopeltis prolifera</h1>
<p>Hypopeltis prolifera, commonly known as the creeping grass or slender grass, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across the ground. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes.</p>
<p>Hypopeltis prolifera plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms in its native ecosystems.</p>
