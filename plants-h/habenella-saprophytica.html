                    <h1>Habenella saprophytica</h1>
<p>Habenella saprophytica, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of roots and its ability to absorb nutrients through its leaves, which are adapted for epiphytic growth on trees. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
<p>Its unique botanical features make it a subject of both scientific interest and conservation concern.</p>
