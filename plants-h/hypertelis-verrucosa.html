                    <h1>Hypertelis verrucosa</h1>
<p>Hypertelis verrucosa, commonly known as the roughleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb characterized by its hairy, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, adapted to attract pollinators in its harsh environment. Hypertelis verrucosa is well-suited to sandy soils and can thrive in low-water conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect its adaptation to survive in extreme climates with limited resources.</p>
