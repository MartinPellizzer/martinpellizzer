<p>Haplopappus eximius subsp.</p>
<p>peirsonii, commonly known as the Sonoran horsebrush, is a shrub native to the Sonoran Desert region of North America. It is characterized by its small, gray-green leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in a pappus, which aids in its distribution across arid environments. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and can tolerate high temperatures and limited water.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in rocky areas and is an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
