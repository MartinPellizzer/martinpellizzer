<p>Haloragis dura, commonly known as the hardy water starwort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. The plant has submerged leaves that are typically oval-shaped with a smooth margin, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent colonizer of wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Haloragis dura is adapted to low-nutrient waters and can tolerate fluctuating water levels.</p>
