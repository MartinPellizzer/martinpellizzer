                    <h1>Hieracium scissum</h1>
<p>Hieracium scissum, commonly known as the cutleaf hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed or divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
