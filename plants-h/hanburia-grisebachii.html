                    <h1>Hanburia grisebachii</h1>
<p>Hanburia grisebachii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its pale green, leaf-like stems and its delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. It requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive, making it a challenging plant to cultivate.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly valued in botanical gardens and conservation efforts.</p>
