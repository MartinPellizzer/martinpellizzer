                    <h1>Harveya hyobanchoides</h1>
<p>Harveya hyobanchoides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, pale green stems and showy, white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. Native to the cloud forests of southern China, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air humidity. Harveya hyobanchoides is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
