                    <h1>Hakea pachyphylla</h1>
<p>Hakea pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration in arid environments. The plant produces cylindrical, red or yellow flower spikes that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its root system is extensive, helping it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Hakea pachyphylla is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
