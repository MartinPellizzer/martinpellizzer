                    <h1>Hyparrhenia formosa</h1>
<p>Hyparrhenia formosa, commonly known as the slender flat sedge, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, where it forms dense mats on the ground. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively and stabilize soil in waterlogged areas.</p>
<p>Hyparrhenia formosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping.</p>
