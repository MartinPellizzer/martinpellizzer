<p>Hieracium subisaricum, commonly known as the meadow hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosette of leaves, which help it thrive in open, disturbed habitats. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the daisy family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain environments.</p>
