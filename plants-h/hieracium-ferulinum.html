<p>Hieracium ferulinum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in the summer, and the plant produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Hieracium ferulinum is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas.</p>
