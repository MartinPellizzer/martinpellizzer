<p>Haworthia reinwardtii var. bellula, commonly known as the bell-shaped Haworthia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically green with white or pale markings. The leaves are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the growing season.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements.</p>
