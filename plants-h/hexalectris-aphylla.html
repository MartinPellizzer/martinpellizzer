                    <h1>Hexalectris aphylla</h1>
<p>Hexalectris aphylla, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying solely on its roots for photosynthesis. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its unique morphology and habitat requirements make it a subject of both scientific interest and conservation concern.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many areas.</p>
