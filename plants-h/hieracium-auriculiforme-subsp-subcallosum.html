<p>Hieracium auriculiforme subsp.</p>
<p>subcallosum, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and basal rosettes of broadly ovate to lanceolate leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it can outcompete native flora and is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
