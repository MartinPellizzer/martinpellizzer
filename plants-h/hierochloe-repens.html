<p>Hierochloe repens, commonly known as mat grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It forms dense, mat-like clumps and has fine, hairless leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Hierochloe repens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
