<p>Heteropogon hirtus var. glaber, commonly known as the smooth false brome, is a perennial grass native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and open woodlands, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, upright stems that bear narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth texture. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each containing small, two-lobed flowers.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its reduced pubescence compared to the typical form of H. hirtus.</p>
