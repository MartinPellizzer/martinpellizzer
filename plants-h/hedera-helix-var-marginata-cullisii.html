<p>Hedera helix var. marginata-cullisii, commonly known as the Cullisii ivy, is a variant of the common English ivy characterized by its distinctive variegation.</p>
<p>This plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves with a striking combination of white, yellow, and green markings. It is a climbing or trailing plant that thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil. The variegation is due to a genetic mutation that affects chlorophyll production.</p>
<p>It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
