                    <h1>Haplopappus aberrans</h1>
<p>Haplopappus aberrans, commonly known as the desert pappus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous root system. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are followed by fluffy pappus structures that aid in wind dispersal of its seeds.</p>
<p>Haplopappus aberrans plays a minor but ecologically significant role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
