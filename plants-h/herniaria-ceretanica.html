                    <h1>Herniaria ceretanica</h1>
<p>Herniaria ceretanica, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a small, mat-forming plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found along shorelines and dunes. The plant has small, round leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its flowers are tiny, white or pale blue, and clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>Herniaria ceretanica is adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient species in harsh coastal habitats.</p>
