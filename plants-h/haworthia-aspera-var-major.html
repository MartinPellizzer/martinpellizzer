                    <h1>Haworthia aspera var. major</h1>
<p>Haworthia aspera var. major, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with white or pale blue markings. The leaves are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers on tall, slender stalks during the growing season.</p>
<p>This plant is well-suited for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements.</p>
