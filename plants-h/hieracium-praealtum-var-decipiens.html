                    <h1>Hieracium praealtum var. decipiens</h1>
<p>Hieracium praealtum var. decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, with hairy stems and basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape. Its flowers are yellow and bloom from late spring to early autumn, attracting various pollinators.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its morphological similarity to other Hieracium species, which can make identification challenging without close examination.</p>
