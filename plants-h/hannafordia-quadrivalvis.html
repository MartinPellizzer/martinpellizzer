The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its unique feature is the four-valved structure of its seed capsules, which open to release seeds.</p>
<p>Hannafordia quadrivalvis is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments.</p>
