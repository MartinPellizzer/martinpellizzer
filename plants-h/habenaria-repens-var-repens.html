<p>Habenaria repens var. repens, commonly known as the creeping marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread along the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, greenish or yellowish flowers that are typically borne on slender stalks above the foliage. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
<p>This orchid is an important indicator species for wetland ecosystems and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
