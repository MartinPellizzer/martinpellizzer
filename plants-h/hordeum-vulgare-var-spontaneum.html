                    <h1>Hordeum vulgare var. spontaneum</h1>
<p>Hordeum vulgare var. spontaneum, commonly known as wild barley, is a wild grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender,丛生 growth habit and spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, two-rowed spikelets that contain three to five bracts. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, fields, and riverbanks.</p>
<p>This species is important in ecological studies due to its role in soil stabilization and as a potential wild relative of cultivated barley.</p>
