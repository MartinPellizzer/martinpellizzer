                    <h1>Hystrix patula f. bigeloviana</h1>
<p>Hystrix patula f. bigeloviana, commonly known as the bigelovian hedgehog cactus, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a cylindrical stem covered in dense, spiny areoles, which are characteristic of the Cactaceae family. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiky structure. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems for survival in arid environments.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its unique appearance and adaptability to dry climates.</p>
