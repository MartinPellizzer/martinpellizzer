<p>It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes and swampy areas. The plant has a slender, erect stem with several leaves, and it produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers. Its roots are often rhizomatous, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The orchid's structure and habitat make it well adapted to its wetland environment.</p>
