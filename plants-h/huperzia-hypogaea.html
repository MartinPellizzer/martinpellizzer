<p>Huperzia hypogaea, commonly known as the ground moss or the dwarf huperzia, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, evergreen, and often clustered foliage, with leaves that are typically elongated and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant is primarily found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the leaves, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Huperzia hypogaea is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in stabilizing soil in certain ecosystems.</p>
