<p>It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Hahnia torminalis is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh, semi-desert conditions.</p>
