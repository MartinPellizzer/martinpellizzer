                    <h1>Haworthia scabra var. tuberculata</h1>
<p>Haworthia scabra var. tuberculata, commonly known as the tuberculate Haworthia, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense rosettes of fleshy, triangular leaves covered in small, raised tubercles that give it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically pale green to bluish-green, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers on slender stems during the spring or summer.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its unique texture and ability to thrive in well-draining soil with minimal water.</p>
