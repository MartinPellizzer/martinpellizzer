                    <h1>Hohenbergia attenuata</h1>
<p>Hohenbergia attenuata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hohenbergia, is a perennial bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a powdery bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces striking, pendulous inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Hohenbergia attenuata is relatively low maintenance and suitable for both indoor and outdoor cultivation in suitable climates.</p>
