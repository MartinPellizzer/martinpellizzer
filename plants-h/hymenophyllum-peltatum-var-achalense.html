                    <h1>Hymenophyllum peltatum var. achalense</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum peltatum var. achalense, commonly known as the Achalense Fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is native to tropical regions of South America. The plant features small, closely spaced leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of rhizomes, which help anchor it to moist, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in humid, shaded areas such as rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appearance.</p>
