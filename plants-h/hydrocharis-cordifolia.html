                    <h1>Hydrocharis cordifolia</h1>
<p>Hydrocharis cordifolia, commonly known as the water shield, is a floating aquatic plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It has heart-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in diameter, with a waxy surface that helps it float on water. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. Its roots are submerged and help stabilize the sediment in shallow water bodies.</p>
<p>Hydrocharis cordifolia plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
