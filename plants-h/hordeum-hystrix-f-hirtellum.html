                    <h1>Hordeum hystrix f. hirtellum</h1>
<p>Hordeum hystrix f. hirtellum, commonly known as the hairy wild barley, is a botanical variant of the wild barley species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and spikelets that are often reddish in color. This subspecies is typically found in temperate regions, growing in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its morphology includes elongated leaves with prominent pubescence, which may aid in water retention and protection against herbivory.</p>
<p>The plant is of interest in studies related to plant adaptation and genetic diversity within the Hordeum genus.</p>
