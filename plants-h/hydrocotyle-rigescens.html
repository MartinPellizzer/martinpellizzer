                    <h1>Hydrocotyle rigescens</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle rigescens, commonly known as the creeping water pennywort, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, arrow-shaped leaves that are often floating or submerged, depending on the water level. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, which bloom in clusters near the water's surface. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in moist soils and shallow water.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle rigescens plays an important ecological role in stabilizing aquatic habitats and providing food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
