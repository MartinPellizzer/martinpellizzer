                    <h1>Hymenophyllum hayatae</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum hayatae, commonly known as the Hayata's spore moss, is a rare and delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, often hairy leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on the bark of trees in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are closely clustered on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, Hymenophyllum hayatae is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
