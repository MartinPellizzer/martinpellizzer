                    <h1>Humata membranulosa</h1>
<p>Humata membranulosa, commonly known as the membrane fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in dense undergrowth. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, with spores produced in clusters on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Humata membranulosa is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
