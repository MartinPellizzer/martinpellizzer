<p>Huperzia selago subsp.</p>
<p>arctica, commonly known as the Arctic huperzia, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, evergreen foliage. It is a small, cryptogamic plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>The plant has a distinctive, creeping growth habit with densely packed, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. It produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are clustered in small, clustered structures called strobili.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is an important component of the vegetation in its native habitats.</p>
