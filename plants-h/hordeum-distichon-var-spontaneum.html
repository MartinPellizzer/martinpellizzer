                    <h1>Hordeum distichon var. spontaneum</h1>
<p>Hordeum distichon var. spontaneum, commonly known as wild barley, is a wild grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and two-rowed spikelets, which are typical features of the Hordeum genus. The plant produces small, pale yellow to brown flowers, and its seeds are enclosed in spikelets that are often wind-dispersed. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>This species is important in agricultural research due to its genetic diversity and potential for improving cultivated barley varieties.</p>
