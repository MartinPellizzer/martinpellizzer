                    <h1>Helianthemum ledifolium var. glaberrimum</h1>
<p>Helianthemum ledifolium var. glaberrimum, commonly known as the glabrous rockrose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, gray-green leaves that are densely packed and covered in a waxy cuticle, helping to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during spring, adding a bright contrast to its foliage. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland scrublands.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens with full sun exposure.</p>
