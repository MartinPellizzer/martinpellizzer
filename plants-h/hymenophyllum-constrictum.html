                    <h1>Hymenophyllum constrictum</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum constrictum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall moss, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. This epiphytic species thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves and are covered by a protective layer called a hymenium.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum constrictum is notable for its ability to retain moisture and its role in forest ecosystems as a pioneer species in moist, shaded habitats.</p>
