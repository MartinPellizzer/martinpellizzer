                    <h1>Hoodia felina</h1>
<p>Hoodia felina, commonly known as the desert lily, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Hoodia felina is also known for its potential role in appetite suppression, though its medicinal uses remain under scientific investigation.</p>
