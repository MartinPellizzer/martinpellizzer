<p>Hachettea austrocaledonica, commonly known as the Cook Islands cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Cook Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to coastal and lowland environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
