<p>Helwingia himalaica var. crenata, commonly known as the Himalayan helwingia, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically crenate at the margins. The plant produces clusters of delicate, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high elevations.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
