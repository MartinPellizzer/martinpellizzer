                    <h1>Helianthemum antitauricum</h1>
<p>Helianthemum antitauricum, commonly known as the Tauric rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in rocky and coastal areas.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with woody stems and small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to poor soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a resilient species in harsh climates.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, especially in Mediterranean-style landscapes.</p>
