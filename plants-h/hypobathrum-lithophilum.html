                    <h1>Hypobathrum lithophilum</h1>
<p>Hypobathrum lithophilum, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a unique symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and arid environments, where it forms a crust-like structure on stone surfaces. The plant's ability to survive in harsh conditions is due to its specialized symbiotic relationship, which allows it to absorb nutrients and water efficiently. It plays a crucial role in soil stabilization and as an indicator of environmental health.</p>
<p>Hypobathrum lithophilum is often found in Mediterranean and temperate regions, where it contributes to ecological diversity.</p>
