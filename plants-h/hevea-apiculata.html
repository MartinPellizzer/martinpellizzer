                    <h1>Hevea apiculata</h1>
<p>Hevea apiculata, commonly known as the apiculate rubber tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its evergreen nature and lance-shaped leaves with a pointed tip. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its latex, similar to that of Hevea brasiliensis, has potential industrial uses.</p>
<p>However, it is less commercially significant than its more well-known relative.</p>
