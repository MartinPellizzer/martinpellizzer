                    <h1>Hieracium albovarium</h1>
<p>Hieracium albovarium, commonly known as the white-haired hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, often silver-gray stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces yellowish to reddish flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats.</p>
