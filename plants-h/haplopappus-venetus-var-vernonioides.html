                    <h1>Haplopappus venetus var. vernonioides</h1>
<p>Haplopappus venetus var. vernonioides, commonly known as the silverleaf groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are silvery-gray due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The small yellow flowers appear in clusters and are followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
