<p>Hakea subterlineata, commonly known as the narrowleaf hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces striking, urn-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, which appear in late summer to early autumn. Its ecological importance includes providing nectar for native birds and insects, and it is adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
