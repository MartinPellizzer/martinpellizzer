<p>Hieracium latens, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can form dense mats due to its stolons. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk.</p>
<p>Hieracium latens is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
