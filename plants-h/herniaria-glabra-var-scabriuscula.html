                    <h1>Herniaria glabra var. scabriuscula</h1>
<p>Herniaria glabra var. scabriuscula, commonly known as the rough sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and coastal environments.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a mat-forming habit with hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It is often found in dunes and rocky shores, where it stabilizes the soil with its extensive root system.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its coarser texture compared to other varieties of Herniaria.</p>
