                    <h1>Hydrocotyle calcicola</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle calcicola, commonly known as the limestone bladderleaf, is a rare perennial herb native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils, typically found in limestone formations. Its flowering stems produce clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hydrocotyle calcicola is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
