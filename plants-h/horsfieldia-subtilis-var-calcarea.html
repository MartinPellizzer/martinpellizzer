                    <h1>Horsfieldia subtilis var. calcarea</h1>
<p>Horsfieldia subtilis var. calcarea, commonly known as the limestone orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the limestone hills of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-white flowers and compact growth habit, often growing in shaded, humid environments. The plant's adaptation to calcium-rich soils is reflected in its name, with "calcarea" referring to its affinity for limestone substrates. Its small size and unique morphology make it a fascinating subject for botanical study.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and is of particular interest to conservationists and botanists alike.</p>
