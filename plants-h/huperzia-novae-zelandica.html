<p>Huperzia novae-zelandica, commonly known as the New Zealand huperzia, is a fern-like plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Huperziaceae and is characterized by its simple, needle-like leaves that form dense, low-growing mats. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the leaves, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Huperzia novae-zelandica is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
