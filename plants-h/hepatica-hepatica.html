                    <h1>Hepatica hepatica</h1>
<p>Hepatica hepatica, commonly known as the liverleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the forests of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmately divided leaves that resemble a liver, hence its common name. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of white, blue, or purple, typically blooming in early spring. Hepatica hepatica thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Its early blooming period makes it an important early nectar source for pollinators.</p>
