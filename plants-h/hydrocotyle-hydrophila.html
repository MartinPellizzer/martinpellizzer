                    <h1>Hydrocotyle hydrophila</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle hydrophila, commonly known as water pennywort, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and wetlands. The plant has floating leaves that are rounded with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its small white flowers bloom in early summer, and it produces small, round fruits that are dispersed by water.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle hydrophila plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life.</p>
