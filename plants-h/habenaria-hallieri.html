<p>Habenaria hallieri, commonly known as the pink lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and its distinctive inflorescence of pink or white flowers arranged in a loose, spreading raceme. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its flowers are spurred at the base, a feature common in many orchid species, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Habenaria hallieri is known for its delicate appearance and is often cultivated for its ornamental value.</p>
