<p>Hemiscola aculeata, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant flowers, often in shades of yellow, orange, or red, which bloom in the spring. Its pads, or cladodes, are covered in small spines that provide protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>The fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and has been used by indigenous peoples for food and traditional medicine.</p>
