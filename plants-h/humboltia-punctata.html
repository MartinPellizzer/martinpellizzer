<p>Humboltia punctata, commonly known as the California buckeye, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically five to seven lobes, and its distinctive yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, spiny fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are a critical food source for certain wildlife species. Humboltia punctata is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of the local ecosystem and a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
