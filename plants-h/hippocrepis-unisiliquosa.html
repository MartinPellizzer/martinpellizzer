<p>Hippocrepis unisiliquosa, commonly known as the single-seed orchid, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on its host plants for nutrients. The plant produces a single, showy flower that typically blooms in late spring or early summer. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with specific host plants, such as grasses and sedges.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
