                    <h1>Habenaria depauperata</h1>
<p>Habenaria depauperata, commonly known as the poor orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, slender stem that produces a few small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky areas. It has a short flowering period, usually in the spring, and relies on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
