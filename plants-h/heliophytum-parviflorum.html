                    <h1>Heliophytum parviflorum</h1>
<p>Heliophytum parviflorum, commonly known as the dwarf sunflower, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features compact, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in spring or early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
