<p>Haworthia arachnoidea var. minor, commonly known as the miniature spider plant, is a compact succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, bluish-green leaves with white tubercles that resemble small spider legs, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers on slender stems during the growing season. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to maintain its compact form.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
