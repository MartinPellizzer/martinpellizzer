                            <h1>Hedyotis Foetida</h1>
<p>Hedyotis foetida is a small, herbaceous plant known for its distinctive appearance and medicinal uses. It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas across parts of Asia and Africa. The plant features tiny, bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a vibrant touch to its natural habitat. Despite its attractive blooms, it is often overlooked due to its strong, unpleasant odor. This unique combination of beauty and fragrance makes it an intriguing subject for botanical study and traditional medicine.</p>
