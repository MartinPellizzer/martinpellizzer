                    <h1>Hudsonia ericoides f. leucantha</h1>
<p>Hudsonia ericoides f. leucantha, commonly known as the white-flowered heath, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and cool, moist summers. It is often found in association with other Ericaceae species in maritime chaparral habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic plant.</p>
