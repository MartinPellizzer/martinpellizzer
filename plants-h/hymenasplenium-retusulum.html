<p>Hymenasplenium retusulum, commonly known as the broad-leafed woodfern, is a fern species native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, intricate fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable environments.</p>
