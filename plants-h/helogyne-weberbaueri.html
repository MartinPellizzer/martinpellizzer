<p>Helogyne weberbaueri, commonly known as the Weberbauer's helogyne, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that collect water, creating a small ecosystem. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and insects. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its high-altitude environment.</p>
<p>Helogyne weberbaueri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens.</p>
