                            <h1>Hieracium Laevigatum Subsp. Gothicum</h1>
<p>Hieracium laevigatum subsp. gothicum is a lesser-known member of the dandelion family known for its striking appearance and ecological importance. This subspecies is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges across Europe and parts of Asia. Its leaves are broadly lance-shaped with a wavy margin, and its flowers bloom in a cluster of yellow petals that attract various pollinators. Despite its beauty, it is often overlooked in favor of more common dandelion varieties. Understanding and protecting this plant is crucial for maintaining biodiversity in its native habitats.</p>
