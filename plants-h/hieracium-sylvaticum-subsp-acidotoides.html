<p>Hieracium sylvaticum subsp.</p>
<p>acidotoides, commonly known as the acid-loving wood hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern Europe. It typically grows in acidic soils, often found in woodland areas and heathlands.</p>
<p>The plant features upright stems with lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. Its yellow flowers are clustered in dense, flat-topped inflorescences, and it produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to nutrient-poor environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats.</p>
