<p>Hemiphlebium sphenoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf winter creeper, is a perennial evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of whitish hairs. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are arranged in a distinctive, kidney-shaped pattern. It thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is cultivated in gardens and botanical collections.</p>
