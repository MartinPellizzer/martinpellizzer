<p>Hieracium aligerum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in late summer, and the plant produces achenes with pappi for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Hieracium aligerum is often considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands.</p>
