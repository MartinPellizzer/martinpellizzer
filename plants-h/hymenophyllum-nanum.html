                    <h1>Hymenophyllum nanum</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum nanum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf filmy fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, translucent fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of minute, hair-like structures. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a specialized covering.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and habitat requirements make it an important subject in the study of epiphytic and lithophytic flora.</p>
