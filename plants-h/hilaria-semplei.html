<p>Hilaria semplei, commonly known as the desert grass or silky grass, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue to purple flowers. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Hilaria semplei is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
