                    <h1>Heeria pallida</h1>
<p>Heeria pallida, commonly known as the pale heeria, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It features small, pale green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle visual contrast to its foliage. Heeria pallida is adapted to sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>Its resilience to drought and heat makes it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping in dry landscapes.</p>
