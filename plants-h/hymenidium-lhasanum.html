<p>Hymenidium lhasanum, commonly known as the Lhasa liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors in the Himalayan region. The plant has a thalloid structure with a flat, ribbon-like stem covered in small, leaf-like structures called phyllodes. It reproduces through spores released from specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in cup-like formations called soruses.</p>
<p>Hymenidium lhasanum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystem.</p>
