                    <h1>Homalanthus repandus</h1>
<p>Homalanthus repandus, commonly known as the broadleaf spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1â€“5 meters, characterized by its smooth, often thornless stems and alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, savannas, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain regions.</p>
