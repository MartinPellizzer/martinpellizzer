                <h1>Haworthia habdomadis</h1>
<p>Haworthia habdomadis, commonly known as the moonlight plant, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves with white or pale markings, which give it a striking, almost otherworldly appearance. The plant produces short, upright flower stalks bearing small, white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
