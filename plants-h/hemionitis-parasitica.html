                    <h1>Hemionitis parasitica</h1>
<p>Hemionitis parasitica, commonly known as the sandmat, is a parasitic plant belonging to the family Hemionitidaceae.</p>
<p>It is a root-parasitic species that attaches itself to the roots of other plants, primarily grasses, to obtain nutrients. The plant lacks true leaves and stems, relying entirely on its host for sustenance. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken or even kill its host plants, making it a concern in agricultural settings.</p>
