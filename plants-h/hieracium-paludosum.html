                    <h1>Hieracium paludosum</h1>
<p>Hieracium paludosum, commonly known as the swamp hawkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces yellow flowers in dense, flat-topped clusters. The plant thrives in moist, often nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves and flowers are often covered in a layer of fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant is characteristic of wetland ecosystems and plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
