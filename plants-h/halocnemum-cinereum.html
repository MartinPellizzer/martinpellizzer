                    <h1>Halocnemum cinereum</h1>
<p>Halocnemum cinereum, commonly known as saltbush, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid regions, often found in coastal areas and salt marshes. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss and help it survive in high-salt conditions. Its flowers are typically greenish-white and clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>Halocnemum cinereum plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in saline habitats.</p>
