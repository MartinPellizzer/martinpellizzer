                    <h1>Heteropogon contortus</h1>
<p>Heteropogon contortus, commonly known as the twisted grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa, particularly found in regions with moist soils.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often twisted in appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in wetland habitats and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it can sometimes become invasive in certain environments.</p>
