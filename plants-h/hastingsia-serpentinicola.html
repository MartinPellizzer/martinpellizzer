<p>Hastingsia serpentinicola, commonly known as the serpentine lily, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the coastal regions of California.</p>
<p>It is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, magnesium-rich soils found on serpentine rock outcrops. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers with six petals, typically blooming in late spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense clumps.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
