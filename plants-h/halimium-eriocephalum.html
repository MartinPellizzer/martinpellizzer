<p>Halimium eriocephalum, commonly known as the woolly sandwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers clustered in dense, woolly inflorescences, which give it its common name. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Halimium eriocephalum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance.</p>
