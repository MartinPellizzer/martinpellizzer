<p>Himantoglossum hircinum var. pendulum, commonly known as the hanging orchid, is a rare and distinctive member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pendulous inflorescence, which gives it its common name, and its striking, violet-blue flowers with a contrasting yellow lip. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe, this plant thrives in calcareous soils and open, sunny habitats. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, with lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
