<p>Hammada scoparia, commonly known as the desert broom, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and small, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a splash of color to the desert landscape. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Hammada scoparia plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
