<p>Hepetis tenuis, commonly known as slender liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, mat-forming liverwort that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure with a dorsiventral leaf-like body, and it lacks true roots, stems, and leaves. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes.</p>
<p>Hepetis tenuis is often found in temperate regions and is an important indicator species for humid microhabitats.</p>
