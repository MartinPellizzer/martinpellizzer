<p>Hordeum sativum subsp.</p>
<p>hexastichon, commonly known as wild barley, is a wild grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and spike-like inflorescences composed of multiple rows of bracts.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-lobed, three-awned spikelets. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, fields, and riverbanks.</p>
<p>This subspecies is an important wild relative of cultivated barley, contributing to genetic diversity and potential agricultural improvement.</p>
