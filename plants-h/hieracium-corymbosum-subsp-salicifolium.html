<p>Hieracium corymbosum subsp.</p>
<p>salicifolium, commonly known as the willowleaf hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate to lanceolate leaves that resemble willow leaves, hence its common name.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, flat-topped clusters called corymbs, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Its leaves and stems are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native environment.</p>
