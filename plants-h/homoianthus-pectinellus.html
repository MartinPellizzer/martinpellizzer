<p>Homoianthus pectinellus, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-tolerant nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in desert and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>The yellow sand verbena is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
