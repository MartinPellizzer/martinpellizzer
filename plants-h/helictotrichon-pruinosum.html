<p>Helictotrichon pruinosum, commonly known as the silver hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage, which gives it its common name and helps it reflect excess light in sunny environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in meadows, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Helictotrichon pruinosum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
