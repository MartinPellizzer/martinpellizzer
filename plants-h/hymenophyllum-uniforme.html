<p>Hymenophyllum uniforme, commonly known as the uniform fern, is a small, epiphytic moss-like plant belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of hair-like structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, called soridia, are borne on the underside of the fronds and are responsible for spore production.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum uniforme is known for its unique morphology and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat.</p>
