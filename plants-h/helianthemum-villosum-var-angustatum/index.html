                            <h1>Helianthemum Villosum Var. Angustatum</h1>
<p>Helianthemum villosum var. angustatum is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is known for its small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring and early summer. This variant of the common helianthemum is distinguished by its narrow leaves and compact growth habit. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in sunny, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
