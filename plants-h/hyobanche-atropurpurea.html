                    <h1>Hyobanche atropurpurea</h1>
<p>Hyobanche atropurpurea, commonly known as purple broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. The plant produces showy, purple or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria, which attach to the roots of host plants such as grasses and legumes.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological systems but can be considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
