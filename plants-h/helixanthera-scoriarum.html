<p>Helixanthera scoriarum, commonly known as the scarlet bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant produces striking bell-shaped flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with a contrasting yellow throat. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Helixanthera scoriarum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural environment.</p>
