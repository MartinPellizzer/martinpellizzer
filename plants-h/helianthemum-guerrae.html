<p>Helianthemum guerrae, commonly known as the Canary Islands snowflake, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with compact, evergreen foliage that is typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise subdued appearance.
