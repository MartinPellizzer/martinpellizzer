                    <h1>Huperzia dentata</h1>
<p>Huperzia dentata, commonly known as the toothed huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, linear leaves that are often toothed or serrated along the edges. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Huperzia dentata is a perennial plant that produces spores rather than seeds, and it lacks true roots, relying instead on rhizomes for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
