                            <h1>Haworthia Viscosa</h1>
<p>The Haworthia viscosa, also known as the sticky Haworthia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is prized for its compact size and unique, fleshy leaves that often have a waxy coating. This plant thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for indoor cultivation. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid conditions. The Haworthia viscosa is a popular choice for collectors and gardeners looking for low-maintenance, ornamental plants.</p>
