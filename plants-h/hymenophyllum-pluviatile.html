                    <h1>Hymenophyllum pluviatile</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum pluviatile, commonly known as the rain fern, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, moss-like fronds that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are released in tiny, cup-like structures called sporangia, which are clustered on the undersides of its leaves.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum pluviatile plays a significant role in forest ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
