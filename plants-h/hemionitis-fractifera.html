                    <h1>Hemionitis fractifera</h1>
<p>Hemionitis fractifera, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a small aquatic fern native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble a lace-like pattern. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant in the substrate while supporting its floating fronds.</p>
<p>Hemionitis fractifera is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in aquatic environments.</p>
