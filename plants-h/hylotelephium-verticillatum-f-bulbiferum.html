                    <h1>Hylotelephium verticillatum f. bulbiferum</h1>
<p>Hylotelephium verticillatum f. bulbiferum, commonly known as the "bulbous stonecrop," is a compact, mat-forming succulent with dense clusters of fleshy, blue-green leaves.</p>
<p>It produces showy, pink to red flowers in late summer, typically arranged in tight clusters at the ends of the stems. The plant is native to the rocky slopes of the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Its unique feature is the production of bulbous structures at the base of the stems, which can store water and nutrients.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and drought tolerance in rock gardens and xeriscapes.</p>
