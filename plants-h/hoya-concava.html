<p>Hoya concava, commonly known as the concave waxplant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asclepiadaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia, including regions of Indonesia and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. Hoya concava is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic.</p>
<p>It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
