                            <h1>Hydrocotyle Shanii</h1>
<p>Shan's pennywort, scientifically known as Hydrocotyle shanii, is a rare aquatic plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in cool, shaded streams and wetlands, where its heart-shaped leaves float just beneath the water's surface. This species is notable for its delicate, waxy foliage and its ability to purify water by absorbing excess nutrients. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, Hydrocotyle shanii is now listed as endangered in many parts of its range. Conservation efforts are underway to protect and propagate this unique plant for future generations.</p>
