                            <h1>Holcus Tenuis</h1>
<p>Common bentgrass, scientifically known as Holcus tenuis, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. This plant is valued for its fine texture and dense growth habit, making it a popular choice for lawn and turfgrass applications. Its ability to tolerate moderate foot traffic and its adaptability to various soil conditions contribute to its widespread use in landscaping. Despite its aesthetic appeal, Holcus tenuis also plays an important ecological role by supporting local insect populations and stabilizing soil in natural habitats.</p>
