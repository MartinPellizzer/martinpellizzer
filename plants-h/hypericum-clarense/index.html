<p>Clarence st. john's wort, scientifically known as Hypericum clarense, is a rare and striking plant native to the coastal regions of New Zealand. This species is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and glossy green leaves, which make it visually distinctive in its natural habitat. Despite its beauty, Hypericum clarense is critically endangered due to habitat loss and limited distribution. Conservation efforts are underway to protect and propagate this unique species. Its survival is crucial for maintaining biodiversity in New Zealand's fragile ecosystems.</p>
