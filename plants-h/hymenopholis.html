                    <h1>Hymenopholis</h1>
<p>Hymenopholis, commonly known as the rock fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, delicate fronds and are often found growing on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments. Hymenophillis species typically have a unique structure with a thin, membranous lamina and a specialized rhizome system. They are often epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on other plants or rocks rather than in soil.</p>
<p>The genus is known for its high diversity and is primarily distributed in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
