<p>Herschelianthe lugens, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its deep root system and water-storing tissues. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Herschelianthe lugens plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
