                    <h1>Hyobanche rubra</h1>
<p>Hyobanche rubra, commonly known as red Indian whipsnake, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of woody species. The plant produces small, pink to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are dispersed by animals that consume the fruit, which contains a sticky, nutritious pulp.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized lifestyle and habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
