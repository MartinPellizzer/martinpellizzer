<p>Hammada multiflora, commonly known as the desert broom, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, gray-green foliage and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Hammada multiflora plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
