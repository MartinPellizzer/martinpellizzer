<p>Hymenophyllum asterothrix, commonly known as the star-tipped moss, is a species of fern that belongs to the Hymenophyllaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, creeping growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called soridia, are borne on the underside of the leaves and are arranged in a distinctive star-like pattern.</p>
<p>This unique morphology contributes to its common name and makes it a distinctive member of the moss family.</p>
