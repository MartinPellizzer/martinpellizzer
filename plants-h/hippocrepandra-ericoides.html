                    <h1>Hippocrepandra ericoides</h1>
<p>Hippocrepandra ericoides, commonly known as the dwarf orchid or the bog orchid, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetlands and bogs in northern regions.</p>
<p>It features small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clusters at the base of the plant. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and a fibrous root system adapted to waterlogged soils. It is often found in acidic, nutrient-poor environments, thriving in the understory of coniferous forests.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects its specialized adaptation to moist, boggy habitats.</p>
