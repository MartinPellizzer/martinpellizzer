<p>Hoarea laciniata, commonly known as the lace fern, is a striking ornamental plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It features delicate, feathery fronds that give it a lacy appearance, with each leaflet finely divided and often curled. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by spore-bearing structures, typical of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for humid indoor settings or shaded garden areas.</p>
