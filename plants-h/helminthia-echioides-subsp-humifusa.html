<p>Helminthia echioides subsp.</p>
<p>humifusa, commonly known as the woolly blueweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant has hairy, often glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Its subspecies distinction is based on differences in leaf morphology and flowering characteristics compared to other subspecies of Helminthia echioides.</p>
