                    <h1>Hoffmannseggella adelinae</h1>
<p>Hoffmannseggella adelinae, commonly known as the Adelinae lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its leathery, crust-like thallus. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship between a photosynthetic alga and a fungal partner, enabling it to absorb nutrients from the environment. It is typically found on bark, rocks, and soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and unique morphology make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
