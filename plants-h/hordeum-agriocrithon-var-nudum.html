                    <h1>Hordeum agriocrithon var. nudum</h1>
<p>Hordeum agriocrithon var. nudum, commonly known as the naked barley, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairless stalks and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Its seeds are small and lack the protective hulls found in cultivated barley varieties.</p>
<p>This variant is of interest to botanists and researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptability.</p>
