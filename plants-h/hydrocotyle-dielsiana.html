                    <h1>Hydrocotyle dielsiana</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle dielsiana, commonly known as the "Mexican water shield," is a perennial aquatic plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has floating leaves that are usually divided into lobes, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Its small, yellow flowers appear in clusters and are pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle dielsiana plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and stabilizing water surfaces.</p>
