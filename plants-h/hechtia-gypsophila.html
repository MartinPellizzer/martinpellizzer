<p>Hechtia gypsophila, commonly known as the gypsum hechtia, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are adapted to store water. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red or orange flowers, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
