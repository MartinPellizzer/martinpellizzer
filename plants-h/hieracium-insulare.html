                    <h1>Hieracium insulare</h1>
<p>Hieracium insulare, commonly known as the island hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the British Isles and parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces small, dandelion-like yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. The plant has deeply lobed leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Hieracium insulare is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native flora.</p>
