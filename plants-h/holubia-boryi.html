                    <h1>Holubia boryi</h1>
<p>Holubia boryi, commonly known as the Bory's holubia, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas.</p>
<p>Holubia boryi plays a minor but ecologically significant role in supporting local insect populations and maintaining biodiversity in its native ecosystems.</p>
