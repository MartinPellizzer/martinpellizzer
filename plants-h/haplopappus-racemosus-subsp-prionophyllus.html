<p>Haplopappus racemosus subsp.</p>
<p>prionophyllus, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, white seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance, it is often used in xeriscaping and native plant gardens.</p>
