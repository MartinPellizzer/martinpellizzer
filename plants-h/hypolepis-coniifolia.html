<p>Hypolepis coniifolia, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, narrow, sword-shaped fronds that are often bioluminescent in certain conditions. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Hypolepis coniifolia is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is adaptable to a variety of soil types and light conditions.</p>
