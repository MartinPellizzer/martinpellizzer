<p>Humea squamata, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a unique plant native to the wetlands of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly appearance due to the fine, scale-like structures covering its stems and leaves. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or marshy habitats. Its leaves are typically small and clustered, forming a compact rosette structure.</p>
<p>Humea squamata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or bog gardens.</p>
