                    <h1>Helicodiceros muscivorus</h1>
<p>Helicodiceros muscivorus, commonly known as the moss-eating snail, is a species of air-breathing land snail.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Helicodermatidae and is characterized by its elongated, spiral shell. The plant is not a plant but a mollusk, so it does not have botanical aspects in the traditional sense. However, it is often found in moist, shaded environments where it feeds on mosses and other decomposing organic matter.</p>
<p>Its presence can indicate a healthy, undisturbed ecosystem.</p>
