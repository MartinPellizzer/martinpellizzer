                    <h1>Habenaria sparsiflora var. brevifolia</h1>
<p>Habenaria sparsiflora var. brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland and swampy habitats in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant is characterized by its short, compact inflorescence and is adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are often pollinated by specific insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native environment.</p>
<p>The species is relatively rare and requires careful conservation due to habitat degradation.</p>
