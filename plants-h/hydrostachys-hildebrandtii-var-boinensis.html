                    <h1>Hydrostachys hildebrandtii var. boinensis</h1>
<p>Hydrostachys hildebrandtii var. boinensis, commonly known as the Borneo waterwheel, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features whorled leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped, adapted for efficient water flow. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, enhancing its ornamental value. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems.</p>
