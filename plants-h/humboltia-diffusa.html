                    <h1>Humboltia diffusa</h1>
<p>Humboltia diffusa, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1 to 5 meters, characterized by its woody stems and thick, fleshy leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal water.</p>
<p>Humboltia diffusa is also known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
