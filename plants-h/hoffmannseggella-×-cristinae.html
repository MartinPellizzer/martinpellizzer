<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, often displaying a variety of leaf colors due to its genetic diversity. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central America and is often found in shaded, moist environments. It is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in container gardens.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a model for studying hybridization in plant species.</p>
