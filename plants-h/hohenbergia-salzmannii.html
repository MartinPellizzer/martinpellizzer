                    <h1>Hohenbergia salzmannii</h1>
<p>Hohenbergia salzmannii, commonly known as the Salzmann's hohenbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of dark green, waxy leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking red or orange inflorescences that emerge from the center of the rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Hohenbergia salzmannii is a popular choice for indoor gardens due to its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
