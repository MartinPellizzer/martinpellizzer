<p>Halogeton oppositiflorus, commonly known as the desert saltbush, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in saline soils and is adapted to extreme drought conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in dense clusters, and its leaves are often reduced to scale-like structures. Halogeton oppositiflorus is notable for its ability to store water in its fleshy stems, which helps it survive in harsh desert environments.</p>
<p>It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
