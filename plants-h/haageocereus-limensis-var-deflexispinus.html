                    <h1>Haageocereus limensis var. deflexispinus</h1>
<p>Haageocereus limensis var. deflexispinus, commonly known as the Limen Desert Cactus, is a rare and unique cactus species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in dense, white spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically clustered at the stem tips. Its adaptations to extreme desert conditions include thick, water-storing stems and a minimal leaf surface to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and specialized ecological requirements.</p>
