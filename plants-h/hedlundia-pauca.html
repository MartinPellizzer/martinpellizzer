<p>Hedlundia pauca, commonly known as the sparse hedlund, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its small, pale yellow to white flowers bloom during the cooler months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hedlundia pauca is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
