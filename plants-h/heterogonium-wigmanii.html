<p>Heterogonium wigmanii, commonly known as the zigzag liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flattened, ribbon-like thallus that often exhibits a zigzag or undulating pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rocks or soil in temperate regions. It reproduces through spores, which are produced in specialized structures called sporocarps.</p>
<p>Heterogonium wigmanii plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.</p>
