<p>Heterospathe elata var. palauensis, commonly known as the Palau giant water fern, is a variant of the Heterospathe elata species native to the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is a large, aquatic fern that thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in slow-moving streams and marshy areas. The plant is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that can reach several feet in diameter, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its rhizomes are extensive, allowing it to spread and form dense mats on the water's surface.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing water bodies and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
