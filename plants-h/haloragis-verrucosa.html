<p>Haloragis verrucosa, commonly known as the rough bladderwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and wetlands. The plant is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>Haloragis verrucosa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
