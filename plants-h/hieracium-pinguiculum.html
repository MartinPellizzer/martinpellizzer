                    <h1>Hieracium pinguiculum</h1>
<p>Hieracium pinguiculum, commonly known as the sticky William or buttercup grass, is a small flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to thrive in poor soils, it is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
