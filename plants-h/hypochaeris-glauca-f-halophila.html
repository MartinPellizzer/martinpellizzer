<p>Hypochaeris glauca f. halophila, commonly known as the saltbush hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of southern California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has adapted to saline and arid conditions, making it a hardy species found in coastal dunes and salt marshes. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The inflorescence consists of numerous small florets arranged in a flat-topped cluster, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
