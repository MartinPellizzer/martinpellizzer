                    <h1>Hechtia integerrima</h1>
<p>Hechtia integerrima, commonly known as the blue star, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage that forms a dense, water-holding cup at the base. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, adding a dramatic visual element. Its leaves are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Hechtia integerrima is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact size and ornamental appeal.</p>
