                    <h1>Helichrysum frigidum var. typica</h1>
<p>Helichrysum frigidum var. typica, commonly known as the alpine everlasting, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, golden-yellow flowers that resemble tiny suns. The plant produces papery, dry bracts that persist after the flowers have faded, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with rocky or gravelly conditions.</p>
