                    <h1>Hedysarum retroflexum</h1>
<p>Hedysarum retroflexum, commonly known as the redstem peavine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that mature in the fall, and the plant plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia.</p>
<p>Hedysarum retroflexum is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
