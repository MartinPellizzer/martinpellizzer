                    <h1>Hieracium eriosphaerophorum</h1>
<p>Hieracium eriosphaerophorum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant is notable for its dense, woolly covering on its stems and leaves, which helps it retain moisture in its harsh alpine habitat. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes.</p>
