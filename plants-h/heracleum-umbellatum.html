                    <h1>Heracleum umbellatum</h1>
<p>Heracleum umbellatum, commonly known as cow parsnip, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It features a tall, hollow stem with purple-brown spots and large, umbrella-shaped compound leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in an umbel, which are followed by rounded, bladder-like fruits. It is often found in moist meadows, stream banks, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its sap, which can cause skin irritation, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
