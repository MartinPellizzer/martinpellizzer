<p>Homalobus caespitosus, commonly known as the rough hairpin grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and stiff, wiry leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in open grasslands and rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
