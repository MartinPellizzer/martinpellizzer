                    <h1>Hemionitis dichotoma</h1>
<p>Hemionitis dichotoma, commonly known as the mountain holly or rock holly, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette growth form and succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Hemionitis dichotoma is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in low-water conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of desert ecosystems and a subject of interest in ecological and horticultural studies.</p>
