<p>Hilgeria serpylloides, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions. The plant has a compact rosette of fleshy, grayish-green leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences.</p>
<p>Hilgeria serpylloides is adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry, sunny locations.</p>
