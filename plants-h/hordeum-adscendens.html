<p>Hordeum adscendens, commonly known as the ascending barley, is a grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains, typical of the Poaceae family. Hordeum adscendens is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, temperate climates.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject in studies of alpine flora and plant adaptation.</p>
