                    <h1>Hydrocotyle umbellata var. bonariensis</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle umbellata var. bonariensis, commonly known as the Brazilian water shield, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. The plant produces white, umbrella-like clusters of flowers that bloom above the water surface. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes.</p>
<p>Its roots help stabilize sediment, making it ecologically important in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
