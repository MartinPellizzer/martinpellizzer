                            <h1>Hieracium Amplexicaule Subsp. Petraeum</h1>
<p>Rock groundsel, scientifically known as Hieracium amplexicaule subsp. petraeum, is a unique plant species that thrives in rocky and arid environments. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive leaf structure that clings tightly to the rock surface. This subspecies is native to regions with harsh climates, where it has adapted to survive with minimal water and nutrients. Its flowers, typically yellow or white, add a touch of color to its rugged habitat. Despite its resilience, Rock groundsel remains a rare and often overlooked member of the dandelion family.</p>
