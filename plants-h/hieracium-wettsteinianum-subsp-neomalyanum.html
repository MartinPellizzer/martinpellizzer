<p>Hieracium wettsteinianum subsp.</p>
<p>neomalyanum, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it forms dense, low-growing rosettes.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow composite flowers, which are characteristic of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are usually spoon-shaped and covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems.</p>
