<p>Huernia campanulata var. denticoronata, commonly known as the Cape foveolata, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, ribbed stems and produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is particularly noted for its unique, toothed corona surrounding the flower.</p>
<p>It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value.</p>
