                    <h1>Halenbergia</h1>
<p>Halenbergia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that often appear to be suspended in the air, giving it its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Halenbergia typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its ecological role and its status as a symbol of biodiversity in fragile ecosystems.</p>
