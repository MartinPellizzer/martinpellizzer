                    <h1>Hydranthelium humifusum</h1>
<p>Hydranthelium humifusum, commonly known as the ground liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leafy, thalloid structure that grows close to the ground, often in moist, shaded environments. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a protonema stage that develops into a gametophyte. Hydranthelium humifusum reproduces via spores, which are released from sporangia formed on the upper surface of its thallus.</p>
<p>This species is an important indicator of undisturbed, humid habitats and plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling.</p>
