                    <h1>Hibiscus submaritimus</h1>
<p>Hibiscus submaritimus, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Pacific and Indian Oceans.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its waxy, broad leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, and yellow, which bloom throughout the year. Hibiscus submaritimus thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tidal zones and mangrove areas.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to saltwater makes it an important species in coastal ecosystems.</p>
