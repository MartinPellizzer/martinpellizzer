<p>Haplodiscus humilis, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically features prostrate or decumbent stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually blue or violet in color, often with a white throat. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy surface, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Haplodiscus humilis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas.</p>
