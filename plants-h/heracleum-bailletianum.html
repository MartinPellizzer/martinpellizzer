<p>Heracleum bailletianum, commonly known as the Baillet's giant hogweed, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its large, umbrella-like inflorescence and hollow stems.</p>
<p>It is native to central and eastern Europe and is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as riverbanks and meadows. The plant can grow up to 3 meters tall, with large, heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed. Its flowers are white to pale green and are followed by small, brownish fruits.</p>
<p>Due to its potential to cause skin irritation, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions.</p>
