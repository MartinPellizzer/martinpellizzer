<p>Hesperantha pilosa subsp.</p>
<p>pilosa, commonly known as the hairy spider lily, is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to South Africa, particularly the Western Cape region, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a purple or red throat. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in fine hairs, giving it the "hairy" descriptor in its common name.</p>
<p>This subshrub is typically found in coastal and mountainous areas, and it blooms during the spring and summer months.</p>
