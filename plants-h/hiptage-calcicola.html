                    <h1>Hiptage calcicola</h1>
<p>Hiptage calcicola, commonly known as the limestone hiptage, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom throughout the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in drought-tolerant gardens.</p>
