The plant typically has basal leaves that are broadly ovate to lanceolate, with rough, hairy surfaces. Its flowers are yellow, arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and are often visited by various pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a wide range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
