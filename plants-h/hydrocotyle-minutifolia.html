                    <h1>Hydrocotyle minutifolia</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle minutifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved water pennywort, is a small aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and wetlands. The plant has finely divided, almost fern-like leaves that float on the water surface or emerge from the water. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters and bloom from spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle minutifolia plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
