                    <h1>Heteropterys arenaria</h1>
<p>Heteropterys arenaria, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in spring and early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Heteropterys arenaria plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
