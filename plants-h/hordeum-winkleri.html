<p>Hordeum winkleri, commonly known as the Winkler's barley, is a species of grass native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Hordeum winkleri is adapted to cold and arid environments, often growing in rocky or alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.</p>
