<p>Hieracium nigrescens subsp.</p>
<p>pseudophyllodes, commonly known as the false yarrow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves that are lanceolate in shape.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish to brownish composite flowers, which are typically arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its morphological similarity to other hawkweeds, making it challenging to distinguish without careful examination.</p>
