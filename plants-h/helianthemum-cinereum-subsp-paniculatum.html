<p>Helianthemum cinereum subsp.</p>
<p>paniculatum, commonly known as the silver thrift, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight, helping it thrive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>The subspecies paniculatum is distinguished by its more branched inflorescences compared to other subspecies of Helianthemum.</p>
