<p>Hydrocotyle gummifera, commonly known as the gummed arrowhead, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. The plant features heart-shaped leaves that are often floating or submerged, with a distinctive waxy coating. Its small, white flowers bloom in clusters and are followed by berries that contain toxic seeds.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle gummifera is valued for its ornamental appeal but requires careful handling due to its poisonous properties.</p>
