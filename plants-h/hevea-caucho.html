                    <h1>Hevea caucho</h1>
<p>Hevea caucho, commonly known as rubber tree, is a tropical plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is renowned for producing natural rubber through the latex it secretes from its bark. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil. Its leaves are large, glossy, and arranged alternately along the stems.</p>
<p>The latex is harvested by making incisions in the bark, allowing the milky sap to flow.</p>
