                    <h1>Habranthus</h1>
<p>Habranthus, commonly known as the blue-eyed grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to South America, particularly Brazil, and are characterized by their small, grass-like leaves and striking blue or violet flowers. Habranthus species typically grow in wetland or marshy habitats, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The flowers are usually clustered in dense inflorescences and bloom during the wet season.</p>
<p>Due to their unique appearance and ecological significance, some species of Habranthus are of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
