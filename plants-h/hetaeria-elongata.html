<p>Hetaeria elongata, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are long and narrow, often with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hetaeria elongata is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
