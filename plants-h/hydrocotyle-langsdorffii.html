<p>Hydrocotyle langsdorffii, commonly known as the swamp spurge or water pennywort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the Americas.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of rounded, succulent leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in diameter, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist to aquatic habitats, including marshes, ponds, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle langsdorffii is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality.</p>
