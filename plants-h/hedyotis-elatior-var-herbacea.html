                    <h1>Hedyotis elatior var. herbacea</h1>
<p>Hedyotis elatior var. herbacea, commonly known as the creeping marsh woundwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland and marshy environments.</p>
<p>It features small, opposite, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its stems are prostrate or ascending, often rooting at the nodes, which helps it spread across moist ground.</p>
<p>It is often found in disturbed wetlands and is valued for its ability to stabilize soil in such habitats.</p>
