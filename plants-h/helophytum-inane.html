<p>Helophytum inane, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, pale green stems that resemble ghostly limbs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance and low maintenance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
