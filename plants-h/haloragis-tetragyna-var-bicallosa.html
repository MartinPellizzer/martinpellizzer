                    <h1>Haloragis tetragyna var. bicallosa</h1>
<p>Haloragis tetragyna var. bicallosa, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline and coastal environments.</p>
<p>It features small, ovate leaves with a waxy coating that reduces water loss and salt accumulation. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. Its root system is extensive, helping to stabilize sandy or salty soils.</p>
<p>This variant is particularly resilient to high salinity and wind exposure, making it a valuable plant for coastal rehabilitation projects.</p>
