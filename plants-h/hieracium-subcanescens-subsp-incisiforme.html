<p>Hieracium subcanescens subsp.</p>
<p>incisiforme, commonly known as the cut-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lanceolate leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils.</p>
<p>Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences, particularly in leaf shape and hairiness, compared to other members of the *Hieracium* genus.</p>
