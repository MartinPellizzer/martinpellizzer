<p>Hydrobryopsis sessilis, commonly known as the sessile liverwort, is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as on rocks or soil near streams and wetlands. The plant has a thalloid structure, with a flattened, ribbon-like body that is often covered in tiny, leaf-like structures called phyllidia. It lacks true leaves and roots, relying instead on its thallus for absorption of water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Hydrobryopsis sessilis is an important indicator species for wetland ecosystems due to its specific environmental requirements.</p>
