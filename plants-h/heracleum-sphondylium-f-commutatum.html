                    <h1>Heracleum sphondylium f. commutatum</h1>
<p>Heracleum sphondylium f. commutatum, commonly known as the lesser cow parsley, is a variant of the common hogweed.</p>
<p>It is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and umbrella-shaped inflorescences. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. It grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its similarity to more toxic hogweeds, it requires careful identification to avoid confusion.</p>
