                    <h1>Hemiarrhena plantaginea</h1>
<p>Hemiarrhena plantaginea, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branched stems and small, bright yellow flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Hemiarrhena plantaginea is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils.</p>
