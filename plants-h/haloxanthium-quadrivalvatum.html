                    <h1>Haloxanthium quadrivalvatum</h1>
<p>Haloxanthium quadrivalvatum, commonly known as the four-lobed sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and its leaves are usually four-lobed, giving it its scientific name. It has adapted to survive in harsh environments through its succulent stems and reduced leaf surfaces.</p>
<p>The species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soils in dry habitats.</p>
