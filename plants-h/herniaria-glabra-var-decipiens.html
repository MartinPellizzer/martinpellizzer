                    <h1>Herniaria glabra var. decipiens</h1>
<p>Herniaria glabra var. decipiens, commonly known as the false sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its succulent stems and leaves allow it to store water, making it well adapted to rocky and sandy soils.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished from the typical form by its slightly different leaf shape and habitat preferences.</p>
