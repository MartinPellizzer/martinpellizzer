                    <h1>Hordeum kronenburgii</h1>
<p>Hordeum kronenburgii, commonly known as the Kronenburg barley, is a rare and ancient species of grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and has adapted to harsh alpine environments. Its seeds are small and hardy, often surviving in cold climates and poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, Hordeum kronenburgii is considered a valuable subject for botanical and genetic research.</p>
