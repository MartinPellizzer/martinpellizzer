<p>Hieracium subcrassescens, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads made up of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, exhibiting a rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves. Its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces seeds in achenes that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Hieracium subcrassescens is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature.</p>
