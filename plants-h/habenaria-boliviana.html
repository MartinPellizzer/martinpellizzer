                    <h1>Habenaria boliviana</h1>
<p>Habenaria boliviana, commonly known as the Bolivian marsh orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to South America.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in wet, marshy habitats, often near rivers or in swampy areas. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with three sepals and three petals, characteristic of many orchid species. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a rare and threatened species in its native range.</p>
