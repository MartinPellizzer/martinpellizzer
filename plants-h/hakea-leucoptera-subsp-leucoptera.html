<p>Hakea leucoptera subsp.</p>
<p>leucoptera, commonly known as the white-leaf hakea, is an evergreen shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces spikes of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in heathlands and open woodlands.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in coastal regions.</p>
