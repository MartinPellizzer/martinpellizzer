<p>Hieracium prostratum subsp.</p>
<p>lavernellei, commonly known as the prostrate hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous slender, often reddish stems that lie close to the ground.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish to orange flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are broadly ovate to lanceolate, with a rough, hairy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
