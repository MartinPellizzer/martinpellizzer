<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers are short-lived, typically lasting only a few hours, and are pollinated by nocturnal insects such as moths.</p>
<p>Hylocereus tricae is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine.</p>
