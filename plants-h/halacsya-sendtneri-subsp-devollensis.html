<p>Halacsya sendtneri subsp.</p>
<p>devollensis, commonly known as the Devollensis bellflower, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Albania. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of blue or violet.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, seed-like fruits that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
