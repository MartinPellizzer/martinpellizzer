                    <h1>Haworthia papillaris</h1>
<p>Haworthia papillaris, commonly known as the woolly Haworthia, is a compact, rosette-forming succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, fleshy leaves covered in white, woolly tubercles that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers on slender stalks during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique texture and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
