<p>Herniaria glabra var. scabrida, commonly known as the rough bladderwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, rough hairs. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous or coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations allow it to survive in harsh, cold environments where few other plants can grow.</p>
