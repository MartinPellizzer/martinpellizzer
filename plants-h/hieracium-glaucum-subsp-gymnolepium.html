<p>Hieracium glaucum subsp.</p>
<p>gymnolepium, commonly known as the silver hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and typically hairy stems.</p>
<p>The plant features basal rosettes of silver- or grayish-green leaves with a woolly texture, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in composite inflorescences, producing small seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in dry meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
