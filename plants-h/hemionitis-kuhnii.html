                    <h1>Hemionitis kuhnii</h1>
<p>Hemionitis kuhnii, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats along rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Hemionitis kuhnii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens.</p>
