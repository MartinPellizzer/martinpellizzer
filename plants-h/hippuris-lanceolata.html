                    <h1>Hippuris lanceolata</h1>
<p>Hippuris lanceolata, commonly known as the narrowleaf water-plantain, is a freshwater aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving waters, often in muddy or sandy substrates. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are usually submerged, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, appearing in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Hippuris lanceolata plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for invertebrates and stabilizing sediment.</p>
