<p>Hieracium niphobium subsp.</p>
<p>calodes, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a flowering stem that bears yellow composite flowers.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in rocky and open habitats, often at high altitudes where conditions are harsh. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in cold, dry environments.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter, more compact growth form compared to other members of the Hieracium genus.</p>
