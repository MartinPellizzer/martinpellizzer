<p>Haegiela tatei, commonly known as the Japanese spider fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lacy fronds that resemble spider legs, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of its fronds, typical of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, Haegiela tatei is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
