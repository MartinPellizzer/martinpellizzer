                    <h1>Heracleum pubescens var. glabratum</h1>
<p>Heracleum pubescens var. glabratum, commonly known as the smooth cow parsnip, is a flowering plant in the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with a hairy underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its resemblance to toxic plants, it is sometimes mistaken for poison hemlock, requiring careful identification.</p>
