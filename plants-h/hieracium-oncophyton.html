<p>Hieracium oncophyton, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its roots are fibrous and spread out to anchor the plant.</p>
<p>Hieracium oncophyton is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it both a persistent weed and a colonizer of open habitats.</p>
