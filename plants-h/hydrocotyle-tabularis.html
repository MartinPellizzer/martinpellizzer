<p>Hydrocotyle tabularis, commonly known as the marsh pennywort, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marsh environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that float on the surface of water, with a waxy coating that helps repel water. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in shallow, still waters and is often found in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle tabularis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
