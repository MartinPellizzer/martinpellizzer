<p>Hakea polyacida, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and cylindrical, pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Its woody stems are often covered in a thick layer of resinous exudate, which provides protection against herbivores.</p>
<p>Hakea polyacida is also noted for its ability to thrive in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
