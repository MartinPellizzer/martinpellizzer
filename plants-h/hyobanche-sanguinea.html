                    <h1>Hyobanche sanguinea</h1>
<p>Hyobanche sanguinea, commonly known as red Indian smokeplant, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of woody species. The plant produces showy, red-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine, though its parasitic nature makes it a challenging subject for study.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is classified in the family Orobanchaceae, which includes other hemiparasitic species.</p>
