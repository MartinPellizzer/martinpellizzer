<p>Holcus racemosus, commonly known as the tufted hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, cylindrical inflorescence that bears numerous small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, grassy habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fine, hairy texture that gives it its common name.</p>
<p>Holcus racemosus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
