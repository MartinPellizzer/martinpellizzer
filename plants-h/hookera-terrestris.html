                    <h1>Hookera terrestris</h1>
<p>Hookera terrestris, commonly known as the creeping hooker, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Andean regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming habit with dense, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread easily across rocky or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Hookera terrestris is well adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine meadows.</p>
