                    <h1>Hypericum scabrum var. hyssopifolium</h1>
<p>Hypericum scabrum var. hyssopifolium, commonly known as the rough-stemmed St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, yellow, four-petaled flowers that bloom in summer, typically from June to August. The leaves are narrow, elliptical, and covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a slightly rough texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in woodland edges and rocky areas.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its hyssop-like leaves, which are broader and more lobed than those of the typical H. scabrum.</p>
