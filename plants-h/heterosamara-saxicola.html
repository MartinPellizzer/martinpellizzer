                    <h1>Heterosamara saxicola</h1>
<p>Heterosamara saxicola, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a composite organism consisting of a fungal component and a photosynthetic algal partner.</p>
<p>It thrives in harsh, rocky environments, often found on exposed limestone or granite surfaces. The plant's structure is typically crust-like, forming a dense, mat-like growth that adheres tightly to its substrate. It is capable of surviving in extreme conditions due to its ability to retain moisture and withstand temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>This lichen plays a vital role in soil formation and provides habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
