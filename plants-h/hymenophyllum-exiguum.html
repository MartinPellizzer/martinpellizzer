                    <h1>Hymenophyllum exiguum</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum exiguum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hound's-tongue, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It possesses delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant's fronds are covered in fine, scale-like structures that help reduce water loss in its humid, shaded habitats. It produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in small, spore-bearing clusters called sori.</p>
<p>This species is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in moist, shaded environments.</p>
