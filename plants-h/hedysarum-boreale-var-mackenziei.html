                    <h1>Hedysarum boreale var. mackenziei</h1>
<p>Hedysarum boreale var. mackenziei, commonly known as Mackenzie's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for studying plant adaptations to extreme conditions.</p>
