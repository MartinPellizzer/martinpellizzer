                    <h1>Hybridella globosa var. myriophylla</h1>
<p>Hybridella globosa var. myriophylla, commonly known as the mountain snowflake, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high alpine regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of silver-white, woolly leaves that help it retain heat in cold environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its growth habit is low and compact, often forming dense mats that stabilize soil in rocky habitats.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to harsh conditions, including strong winds, intense sunlight, and nutrient-poor soils.</p>
