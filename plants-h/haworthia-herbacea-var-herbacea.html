<p>Haworthia herbacea var. herbacea, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of thick, fleshy, pale green leaves with distinct white or yellow markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant produces tall, slender flowering stems with clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pale purple flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and rock gardens.</p>
