                    <h1>Hydrocotyle eccentrica</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle eccentrica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water shield, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has delicate, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with smaller leaves submerged underwater. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbels, often appearing in late summer.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle eccentrica plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
