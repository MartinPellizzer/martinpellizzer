The leaves are covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white during the warmer months.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires minimal watering, making it ideal for indoor cultivation.</p>
