<p>Habenaria robinsonii, commonly known as the Robinson's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the soil.</p>
<p>The orchid's morphology includes a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in less favorable conditions.</p>
