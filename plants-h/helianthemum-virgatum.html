<p>Helianthemum virgatum, commonly known as the pink rockrose, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in sunny, well-drained environments. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer, adding color to its rugged habitat. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Helianthemum virgatum is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
