                    <h1>Hieracium farinosum</h1>
<p>Hieracium farinosum, commonly known as the dusty hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant is distinguished by its finely hairy, grayish-green leaves and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in some regions and can outcompete native plant species.</p>
