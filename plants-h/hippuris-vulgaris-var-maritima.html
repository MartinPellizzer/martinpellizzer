                    <h1>Hippuris vulgaris var. maritima</h1>
<p>Hippuris vulgaris var. maritima, commonly known as sea maiden, is a perennial aquatic plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in brackish or freshwater environments, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant has elongated, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, with small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late summer. It plays a role in stabilizing water margins and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate varying salinity levels makes it an important component of coastal wetland ecosystems.</p>
