<p>Heywoodiella oligocephala, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and narrow, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species.</p>
