                    <h1>Hemionitis dalhousiae</h1>
<p>Hemionitis dalhousiae, commonly known as the Dalhousie's hemionitis, is a rare and delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
