                    <h1>Helichrysum horridum</h1>
<p>Helichrysum horridum, commonly known as the African firecracker, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow, papery bracts that resemble small flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than true flowers. The plant thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its aromatic, resinous scent is released when the bracts are disturbed, attracting pollinators like bees and birds.</p>
<p>Helichrysum horridum is also popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
