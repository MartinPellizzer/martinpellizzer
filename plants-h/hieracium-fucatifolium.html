<p>Hieracium fucatifolium, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, rough-textured leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a woolly appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows.</p>
<p>Hieracium fucatifolium is often found in association with other members of the Asteraceae family, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations.</p>
