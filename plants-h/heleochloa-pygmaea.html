<p>Heleochloa pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf hairgrass, is a small, mat-forming grass species native to wetland and marshy environments.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, a common feature among grasses. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in coastal or freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>Its dense growth habit makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
