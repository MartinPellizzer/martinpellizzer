<p>Hemimunroa andina, commonly known as the Andean hemimunroa, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, adapted to the cold and harsh conditions of the Andes. Its leaves are often narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Hemimunroa andina is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and potential ecological significance in high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
