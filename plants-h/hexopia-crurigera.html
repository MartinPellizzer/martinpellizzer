                    <h1>Hexopia crurigera</h1>
<p>Hexopia crurigera, commonly known as the creeping marsh grass, is a perennial herb native to wetland and marsh environments.</p>
<p>It features slender,匍匐 (creeping) stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Hexopia crurigera plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms.</p>
