<p>Hieracium praefrondescens, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features a sprawling growth habit with rhizomatous stems that allow it to spread aggressively in moist, disturbed soils. Its basal leaves are broadly lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow with a central disk.</p>
<p>Hieracium praefrondescens is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations.</p>
