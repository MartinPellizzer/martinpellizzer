<p>Hieracium hemiplecoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It features lance-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it can outcompete native vegetation and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
