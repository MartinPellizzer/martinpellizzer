                    <h1>Helianthus annuus var. apicalis</h1>
<p>Helianthus annuus var. apicalis, commonly known as the apical sunflower, is a variant of the common sunflower characterized by its unique floral structure.</p>
<p>This plant typically features a single, large, showy flower head at the tip of a sturdy stem, distinguishing it from the more branched forms of Helianthus annuus. The flower head is composed of numerous ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, which are rich in pollen and nectar. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and agricultural settings.</p>
<p>The apical sunflower is also valued for its seeds, which are used in food and oil production.</p>
