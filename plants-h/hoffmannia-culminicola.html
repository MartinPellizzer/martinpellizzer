<p>Hoffmannia culminicola, commonly known as the highland hoffmannia, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy leaves, which help it withstand cold and windy conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
