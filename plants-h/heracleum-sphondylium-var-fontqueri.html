                    <h1>Heracleum sphondylium var. fontqueri</h1>
<p>Heracleum sphondylium var. fontqueri, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cow parsnip, is a biennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, palmately lobed leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbrella-like clusters, which develop into small, smooth, oval fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest understories.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially allergenic due to its pollen.</p>
