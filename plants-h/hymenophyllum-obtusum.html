<p>Hymenophyllum obtusum, commonly known as the broad-leaved filmy fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum obtusum plays an important ecological role in forest understories by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for small organisms.</p>
