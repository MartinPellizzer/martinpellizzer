                    <h1>Hydnora triceps</h1>
<p>Hydnora triceps, commonly known as the triple-stalked hydnora, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Hydnoraceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of woody plants. The plant produces a unique, fleshy, and often foul-smelling inflorescence that attracts pollinators such as flies. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female structures, and it relies on insects for pollination.</p>
<p>Hydnora triceps is native to southern Africa and is known for its unusual morphology and lack of visible leaves.</p>
