                    <h1>Hydrocotyle bracteata</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle bracteata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water pennywort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams, where it forms dense mats on the water surface. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a valuable habitat for aquatic life and a potential invasive species in non-native regions.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle bracteata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality.</p>
