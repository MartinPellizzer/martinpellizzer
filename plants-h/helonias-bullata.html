                    <h1>Helonias bullata</h1>
<p>Helonias bullata, commonly known as the purple bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic insects, allowing the plant to obtain nutrients from its nutrient-poor environment. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as marshes and ponds. Its leaves are submerged, while its stems and flowers rise above the water surface.</p>
<p>Helonias bullata plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling insect populations and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
