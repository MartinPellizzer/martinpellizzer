                    <h1>Habenella ligulata</h1>
<p>Habenella ligulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf false nettle, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes stinging nettles, and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces tiny, dry fruits called cypselae.</p>
<p>Although it lacks the stinging hairs of true nettles, it is often mistaken for them due to its similar appearance.</p>
