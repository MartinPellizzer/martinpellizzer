<p>Hieracium laevigatum subsp.</p>
<p>subconfertum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and basal leaves that are broadly ovate to lanceolate in shape.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats such as meadows and roadsides.</p>
<p>Its subspecies status reflects subtle differences in morphology, particularly in the density and structure of its hairy foliage.</p>
