<p>Hieracium pseudexilentum, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and hairy, with yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The species is often mistaken for true dandelions due to its similar appearance, but it can be distinguished by its shorter stems and smaller leaves.</p>
