<p>Huidobria fruticosa, commonly known as the silverleaf shrub, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Huidobria fruticosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
