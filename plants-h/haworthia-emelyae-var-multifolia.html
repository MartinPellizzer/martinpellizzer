                    <h1>Haworthia emelyae var. multifolia</h1>
<p>Haworthia emelyae var. multifolia, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, rosette-forming succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves with distinctive white to light green markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant produces tall, slender flower stems with small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
