                    <h1>Hymenoclea salsola var. pentalepis</h1>
<p>Hymenoclea salsola var. pentalepis, commonly known as the coastal sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming annual or perennial herb with small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves and stems are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats.</p>
