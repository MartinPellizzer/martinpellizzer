                    <h1>Hemionitis windhamii</h1>
<p>Hemionitis windhamii, commonly known as the Windham's hemionitis, is a rare and delicate fern native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in crevices or on cliff faces. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
