<p>Habrothamnus purpureus, commonly known as the purple sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense cushions or mats, which help it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, clustered in tight inflorescences, and bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in alpine and tundra habitats.</p>
