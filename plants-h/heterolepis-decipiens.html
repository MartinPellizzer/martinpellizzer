<p>Heterolepis decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive grass, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in panicles, which are typically wind-pollinated. Heterolepis decipiens thrives in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and pond edges.</p>
<p>Its name "deceptive grass" likely refers to its ability to mimic other grasses, making it difficult to identify without close examination.</p>
