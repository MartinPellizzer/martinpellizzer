                    <h1>Hydnophytum orichalcum</h1>
<p>Hydnophytum orichalcum, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from its host through specialized structures called haustoria.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and is often found growing on the branches of dipterocarp trees. The plant has small, elliptical leaves and produces yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its habitat.</p>
