<p>Heracleum lecoquii, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a tall, herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It can grow up to 5 meters in height, with large, umbrella-like inflorescences and deeply lobed leaves. The plant is characterized by its thick, hairy stems and clusters of small, white flowers. It thrives in moist, sunny habitats such as riverbanks and meadows.</p>
