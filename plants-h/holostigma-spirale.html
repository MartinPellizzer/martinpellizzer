                    <h1>Holostigma spirale</h1>
<p>Holostigma spirale, commonly known as the spiral liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pterygopariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, spiral-shaped thallus that forms a dense, carpet-like growth on moist, shaded surfaces. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead consists of a leafy structure that absorbs water and nutrients directly from the environment. Holostigma spirale thrives in humid environments, often found in shaded rock crevices or on decaying wood.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
