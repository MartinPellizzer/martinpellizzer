                    <h1>Hardwickia trapeziformis</h1>
<p>Hardwickia trapeziformis, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and thick, fissured bark that provides protection against fire and insect infestation. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, elliptical seeds. It is well adapted to dry conditions, making it a resilient species in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its hard, heavy wood is highly valued for construction and tool-making, though its slow growth rate makes it a conservation concern.</p>
