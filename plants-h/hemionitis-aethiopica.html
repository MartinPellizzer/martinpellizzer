                    <h1>Hemionitis aethiopica</h1>
<p>Hemionitis aethiopica, commonly known as the African rock fern, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant features small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss, and it produces spore-bearing structures called sorus. Hemionitis aethiopica thrives in rocky soils and is often found in mountainous or semi-desert areas.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and resilience make it an important component of its native ecosystems.</p>
