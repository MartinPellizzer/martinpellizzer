                    <h1>Habenaria secundiflora</h1>
<p>Habenaria secundiflora, commonly known as the secondary-flowered orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often in the understory where it can receive indirect sunlight. The plant produces a single stem with several flowers, each featuring a distinctive three-lobed lip. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil, which is essential for its growth in nutrient-poor habitats.</p>
<p>The orchid's flowering period usually occurs during the wet season, enhancing its chances of pollination by insects.</p>
