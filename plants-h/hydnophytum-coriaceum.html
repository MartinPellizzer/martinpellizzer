                    <h1>Hydnophytum coriaceum</h1>
<p>Hydnophytum coriaceum, commonly known as the sticky root epiphyte, is a tropical plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique ability to form symbiotic relationships with certain fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the air and rain. The plant has a dense, velvety covering of fine hairs that gives it a sticky texture, aiding in capturing moisture and particles. Its roots are specialized for anchoring to host trees and can secrete substances that enhance nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Hydnophytum coriaceum is typically found in humid, shaded environments in Southeast Asia and parts of Africa.</p>
