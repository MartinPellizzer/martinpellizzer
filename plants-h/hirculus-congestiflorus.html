                    <h1>Hirculus congestiflorus</h1>
<p>Hirculus congestiflorus, commonly known as the clustered hornplant, is a rare flowering species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, waxy flowers that bloom in shades of violet and white. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor in rocky soil, allowing it to thrive in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.</p>
