                    <h1>Hevea membranacea var. leiogyne</h1>
<p>Hevea membranacea var. leiogyne, commonly known as the rubber vine, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its climbing habit and heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its latex, similar to that of the rubber tree, has been used in traditional applications.</p>
<p>However, it is less commercially significant compared to other Hevea species.</p>
