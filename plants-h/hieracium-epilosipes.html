<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous tiny florets. The plant features a basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers.</p>
<p>Hieracium epilosipes is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
