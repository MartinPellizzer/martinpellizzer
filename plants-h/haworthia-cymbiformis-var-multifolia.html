                    <h1>Haworthia cymbiformis var. multifolia</h1>
<p>Haworthia cymbiformis var. multifolia, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves with distinctive white or yellowish markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The leaves are typically short and thick, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers on a tall stem during the growing season.</p>
<p>This plant is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance.</p>
