<p>Caspian saltwort, scientifically known as Halocnemum caspicum, is a hardy halophyte native to the arid regions of the Caspian Sea basin. This unique plant thrives in saline and alkaline soils where few other species can survive. Its ability to accumulate salt in its tissues makes it an important component of coastal and desert ecosystems. The plant's robust structure and salt tolerance have made it a subject of interest for ecological and agricultural research. Despite its harsh environment, Caspian saltwort plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting biodiversity in its native habitat.</p>
