                    <h1>Haloschoenus capillaris var. descendens</h1>
<p>Haloschoenus capillaris var. descendens, commonly known as the slender swamp grass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, thriving in environments with consistent hydration. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet-like structure that produces small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its slightly shorter stature compared to the typical form of Haloschoenus capillaris.</p>
