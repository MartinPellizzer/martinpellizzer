                    <h1>Huperzia sieboldii</h1>
<p>Huperzia sieboldii, commonly known as the Japanese clubmoss, is a perennial evergreen plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Huperziaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces sporangia on specialized structures called strobila, which are typically found at the base of the leaves. Huperzia sieboldii thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
