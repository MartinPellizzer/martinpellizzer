                    <h1>Haplopappus illinitus</h1>
<p>Haplopappus illinitus, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous, silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by tufts of feathery pappus that aid in wind dispersal. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in dry, well-drained soils, making it well adapted to desert environments.</p>
<p>Haplopappus illinitus is often found in grasslands, shrublands, and along rocky slopes in its native range.</p>
