                    <h1>Hemionitis neglecta</h1>
<p>Hemionitis neglecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a small aquatic fern native to parts of Asia and Australia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds that are often submerged or floating. Its rhizomes form a dense network that helps stabilize the sediment in its environment.</p>
<p>Hemionitis neglecta is characterized by its lack of true roots and its ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
