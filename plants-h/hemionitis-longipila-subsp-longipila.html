<p>Hemionitis longipila subsp.</p>
<p>longipila, commonly known as the long-leaf hemionitis, is a rare and specialized aquatic plant found in specific wetland habitats. It is characterized by its finely divided, linear leaves that form dense, floating mats on the water surface.</p>
<p>The plant has small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish in color, adapted for pollination by wind or insects. It thrives in nutrient-poor, freshwater environments and is sensitive to water quality changes.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental degradation, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
