<p>Hieracium rubiginosum var. peccense, commonly known as the rusted hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellowish to reddish flowers and hairy, lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and is often found in moist environments. It produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal, aiding in its spread.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many regions where it has been introduced.</p>
