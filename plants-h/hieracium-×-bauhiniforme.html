<p>Hieracium × bauhiniforme, commonly known as the hybrid hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Hieracium piloselloides and Hieracium aurantiacum, leading to a variety of morphological characteristics. The plant typically has dark green, hairy leaves and produces yellow or orange flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence.
