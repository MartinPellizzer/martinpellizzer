<p>Hypolepis stolonifera, commonly known as the running shield fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, with stolons that allow it to spread and form dense mats. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with a distinctive shield-shaped appearance, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its ability to propagate through rhizomes makes it a resilient and adaptable species in its native habitat.</p>
