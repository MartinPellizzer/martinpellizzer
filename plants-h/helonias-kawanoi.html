<p>Helonias kawanoi, commonly known as the Kawano's bladderwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, inflated leaves that function as bladders to trap tiny aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and wetlands. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, often arranged in a dense cluster at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Helonias kawanoi is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive.</p>
