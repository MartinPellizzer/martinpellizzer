<p>Hemicarex thunbergii, commonly known as Thunberg's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, wet meadows, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower spikes during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Hemicarex thunbergii is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
