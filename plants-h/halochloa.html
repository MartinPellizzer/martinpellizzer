                    <h1>Halochloa</h1>
<p>Halochloa, commonly known as saltgrass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in saline or coastal environments, where they tolerate high salt concentrations in the soil. Halochloa species are characterized by their narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. They play an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing soil erosion.</p>
<p>Due to their salt tolerance, they are often used in ecological restoration projects in arid and coastal regions.</p>
