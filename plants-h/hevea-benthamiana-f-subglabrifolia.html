                    <h1>Hevea benthamiana f. subglabrifolia</h1>
<p>Hevea benthamiana f. subglabrifolia, commonly known as the subglabrifoliate rubber tree, is a botanical variant of the rubber tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reduced leaf pubescence, giving it a smoother appearance compared to the typical form. The plant is primarily cultivated for its latex-producing capabilities, which are essential in the rubber industry. Its botanical features include alternate, simple leaves with a slightly elliptical shape.</p>
<p>This form is often used in genetic research due to its ease of cultivation and genetic stability.</p>
