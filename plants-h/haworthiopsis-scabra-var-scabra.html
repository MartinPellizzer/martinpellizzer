                    <h1>Haworthiopsis scabra var. scabra</h1>
<p>Haworthiopsis scabra var. scabra, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of thick, fleshy, light green leaves with distinct white or pale longitudinal markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
