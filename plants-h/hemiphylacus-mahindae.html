                    <h1>Hemiphylacus mahindae</h1>
<p>Hemiphylacus mahindae, commonly known as the Mahindae's orchid, is a rare and unique species native to the tropical rainforests of Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>This orchid exhibits a distinctive growth habit, with its pseudobulbs and long, slender leaves adapted to thrive in the shaded understory of its habitat. It produces striking, fragrant flowers with intricate patterns, often in shades of yellow and green, which attract specific pollinators. The plant's botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptations to the humid and nutrient-poor conditions of its native environment.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Hemiphylacus mahindae is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
