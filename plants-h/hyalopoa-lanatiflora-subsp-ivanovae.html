                    <h1>Hyalopoa lanatiflora subsp. ivanovae</h1>
<p>Hyalopoa lanatiflora subsp.</p>
<p>ivanovae, commonly known as the Ivanov's woolly hyalopoa, is a rare and specialized plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that provides insulation against the cold and arid conditions of its habitat.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. It thrives in rocky soils and requires well-drained conditions to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
