                    <h1>Haloxylon aphyllum</h1>
<p>Haloxylon aphyllum, commonly known as the screwbean, is a shrub native to arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, bean-like fruits that contain a high concentration of sugars. The plant is adapted to extreme drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater. Its leaves are reduced to small scales, minimizing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Haloxylon aphyllum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
