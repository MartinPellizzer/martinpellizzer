                    <h1>Herniaria polygonoides var. diffusa</h1>
<p>Herniaria polygonoides var. diffusa, commonly known as the hairy sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and coastal environments.</p>
<p>It features small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, typically arranged in dense, compact inflorescences. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to stabilize loose, sandy soils.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other members of the Caryophyllaceae family, sharing similar morphological traits.</p>
