<p>Hypobathrum venulosum, commonly known as the veined bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves and specialized structures called bladders, which it uses to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its flowers are small and usually pink or purple, arranged in a spike-like inflorescence.</p>
<p>Hypobathrum venulosum is a carnivorous plant that supplements its nutrient intake by digesting trapped prey.</p>
