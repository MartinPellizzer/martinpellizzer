<p>Hendecandra maritima, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in tidal zones and along shorelines. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and fluctuating water levels makes it well adapted to maritime environments.</p>
<p>Hendecandra maritima plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
