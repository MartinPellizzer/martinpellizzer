<p>Hemidictyum ceterach, commonly known as the narrowleaf water plantain, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that helps it resist water loss. Its flowers, which appear in late summer, are small and inconspicuous, arranged in dense clusters.</p>
<p>Hemidictyum ceterach plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians.</p>
