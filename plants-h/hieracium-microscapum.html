<p>Hieracium microscapum, commonly known as the small-stemmed hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. It has small, often inconspicuous flowers that are yellow to reddish in color, and its leaves are usually lance-shaped with rough textures.</p>
<p>Due to its low-growing habit and modest appearance, it is often overlooked despite its ecological significance in supporting pollinators.</p>
