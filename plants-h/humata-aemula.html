                    <h1>Humata aemula</h1>
<p>Humata aemula, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves that resemble tendrils and its striking, pale pink or white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees rather than in soil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Humata aemula has small, specialized roots that absorb moisture and nutrients from the air, making it highly dependent on its surroundings.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its delicate nature, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
