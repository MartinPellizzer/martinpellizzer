                    <h1>Hedysarum glutinosum</h1>
<p>Hedysarum glutinosum, commonly known as sticky vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by bean-like pods containing edible seeds. Hedysarum glutinosum is adapted to rocky and dry soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Its sticky hairs on the stems and leaves help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
