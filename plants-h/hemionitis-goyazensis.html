                    <h1>Hemionitis goyazensis</h1>
<p>Hemionitis goyazensis, commonly known as the Goyazensis rock fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery spores. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in rocky outcrops and forested areas. Its reproductive structures are closely clustered, and it produces spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemionitis goyazensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
