                    <h1>Hypericum schlosseri</h1>
<p>Hypericum schlosseri, commonly known as the creeping St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, woody stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or gravelly ground. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture.</p>
<p>Hypericum schlosseri is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
