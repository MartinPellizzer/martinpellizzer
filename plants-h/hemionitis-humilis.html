<p>Hemionitis humilis, commonly known as the lesser hemionitis, is a small, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and low moisture conditions. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters during the spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, Hemionitis humilis is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
