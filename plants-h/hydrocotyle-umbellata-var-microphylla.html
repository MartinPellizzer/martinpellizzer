<p>Hydrocotyle umbellata var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved water pennywort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and ditches. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are often floating or submerged, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbels, which are characteristic of the Araliaceae family.</p>
