<p>Horridocactus horridus, commonly known as the thorned cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in dense clusters of sharp, backward-pointing spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which bloom at the tips of the stems. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to desert environments.</p>
<p>Horridocactus horridus is a slow-growing plant that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil.</p>
