                    <h1>Hymenophyllum francavillei</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum francavillei, commonly known as the Frenchman's fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum francavillei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or terrariums.</p>
