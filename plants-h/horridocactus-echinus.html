                    <h1>Horridocactus echinus</h1>
<p>Horridocactus echinus, commonly known as the spiny hedgehog cactus, is a distinctive member of the Cactaceae family native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, sharp spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and adaptations make it a notable species in desert ecosystems.</p>
