<p>Hieracium marinum, commonly known as sea hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy, lobed leaves that help it withstand salty and windy conditions. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. Its life cycle is adapted to the harsh maritime environment, with rapid growth and flowering during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Hieracium marinum plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
