<p>Hymenodictyon austroafricanum, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and has small, leathery leaves that are often clustered in dense, flat sprays. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, followed by small, fleshy berries. Its roots form haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ecological role in supporting various bird species that feed on its berries.</p>
