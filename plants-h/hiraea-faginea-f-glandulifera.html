<p>Hiraea faginea f. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular-fruited hiraea, is a variant of the hiraea plant characterized by its distinctive glandular structures on its leaves and fruits.</p>
<p>This plant is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. Its leaves are typically compound, with a feathery appearance, and the plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels.
