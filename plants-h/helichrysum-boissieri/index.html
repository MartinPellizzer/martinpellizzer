                            <h1>Helichrysum Boissieri</h1>
<p>Golden everlasting, scientifically known as Helichrysum boissieri, is a strikingly beautiful plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. Its name derives from the golden color of its dried flowers, which retain their vibrant hue even after being harvested. This resilient plant thrives in harsh conditions, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. With its compact growth habit and long-lasting blooms, it adds both visual interest and ecological value to any landscape. Its ability to survive with minimal water has made it a favored plant among gardeners seeking low-maintenance, drought-tolerant species.</p>
