<p>Hieracium racemosum subsp.</p>
<p>alismatifolium, commonly known as the waterleaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are broadly ovate to heart-shaped, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, tall flowering stem that bears a dense cluster of yellow flowers, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are often mistaken for those of waterleaf (Lithospermum officinale) due to their similar appearance.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and wetlands.</p>
