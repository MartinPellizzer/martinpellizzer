<p>Haplophyllum viridulum, commonly known as the green sandwort, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, glossy green leaves that form a mat-like structure on the ground. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the late spring and early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to maritime climates with high salt exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in coastal gardens.</p>
