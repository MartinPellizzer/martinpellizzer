<p>Hieracium viscosum subsp.</p>
<p>scariolifolium, commonly known as the sticky hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodlands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are sticky due to the presence of glandular trichomes, which secrete a viscous substance.</p>
<p>The subspecies scariolifolium is distinguished by its narrower, more elongated leaves compared to other varieties of Hieracium viscosum.</p>
