                    <h1>Hymenolepis mucronata</h1>
<p>Hymenolepis mucronata, commonly known as the spiny-headed worm, is a parasitic plant that belongs to the family Dendrostaeniaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a spiny, segmented body that allows it to attach to the intestinal walls of its host. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead relies on its specialized structure for nutrient absorption. It is primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it infects various hosts, including mammals and birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its host environment.</p>
