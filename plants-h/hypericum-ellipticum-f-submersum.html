<p>Hypericum ellipticum f. submersum, commonly known as the submerged St. John's wort, is a unique variant of the St. John's wort species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its semi-aquatic growth habit, often found in wetland environments. The plant features small, elliptical leaves that are typically submerged or partially submerged in water. Its flowers are yellow and resemble those of the standard St. John's wort, though they may be less showy.</p>
<p>This form is adapted to aquatic conditions, with specialized structures that aid in buoyancy and nutrient absorption.</p>
