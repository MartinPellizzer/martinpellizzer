                    <h1>Hakea falcata var. subuninervis</h1>
<p>Hakea falcata var. subuninervis, commonly known as the narrow-veined hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces cylindrical, red-brown flower spikes that bloom in late winter to early spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody structure and drought tolerance make it well adapted to the harsh, dry environments of its native range.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its reduced number of veins in the leaves compared to other hakea species.</p>
