<p>Holosteum umbellatum subsp.</p>
<p>umbellatum, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as along riverbanks and in seasonally flooded areas.</p>
<p>The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale green. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in suitable environments.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its compact inflorescence and specific geographic distribution.</p>
