                    <h1>Halocnemum arabicum</h1>
<p>Halocnemum arabicum, commonly known as the desert sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments, often found in coastal dunes and salt marshes. The plant has small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, and its leaves are succulent, adapted to store water. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate extreme conditions makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects.</p>
