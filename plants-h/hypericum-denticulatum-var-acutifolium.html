<p>Hypericum denticulatum var. acutifolium, commonly known as the sharp-leaved St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in summer, which are attractive to pollinators. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or coastal environments.</p>
<p>Its medicinal properties are similar to other Hypericum species, though it is less commonly used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
