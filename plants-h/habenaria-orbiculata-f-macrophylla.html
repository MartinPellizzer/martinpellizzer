                    <h1>Habenaria orbiculata f. macrophylla</h1>
<p>Habenaria orbiculata f. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species characterized by its robust, grass-like foliage.</p>
<p>It features showy, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with prominent, spurred petals. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, preferring shaded to semi-shaded conditions. Its roots are fibrous, and it often forms dense colonies in suitable environments.</p>
<p>The morphological traits of this form, including its larger leaves and floral structure, distinguish it from the typical form of Habenaria orbiculata.</p>
