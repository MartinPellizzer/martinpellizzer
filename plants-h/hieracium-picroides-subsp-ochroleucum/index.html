                            <h1>Hieracium Picroides Subsp. Ochroleucum</h1>
<p>Hieracium picroides subsp. ochroleucum is a lesser-known member of the dandelion family known for its delicate yellow flowers and hairy stems. This subspecies thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands across parts of Europe. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a rough texture, while its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Despite its modest appearance, it plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this plant from habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
