                    <h1>Halothamnus heptapotamicus var. hispidulus</h1>
<p>Halothamnus heptapotamicus var. hispidulus, commonly known as the hispid halothamnus, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline and arid environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant exhibits a low-growing habit with dense, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss. It thrives in coastal and inland salt marshes, often forming dense stands in disturbed or saline soils.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures are small and clustered, typical of many halophytes, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat.</p>
