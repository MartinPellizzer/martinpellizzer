<p>Haplopteris yakushimensis, commonly known as the Yakushimense Haplopteris, is a rare fern species native to Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Haplopteraceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
