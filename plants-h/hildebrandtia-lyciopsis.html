<p>Hildebrandtia lyciopsis, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family, characterized by its twining stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, pale yellow or white flowers that open in the early morning and close by midday, adapting to the extreme heat of its environment. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Hildebrandtia lyciopsis is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access underground water sources.</p>
