                    <h1>Hordeum taganrocense</h1>
<p>Hordeum taganrocense, commonly known as the Tanganroos barley, is a grass species native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Hordeum taganrocense is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for drought resistance and genetic diversity.</p>
