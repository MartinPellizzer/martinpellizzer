<p>Habenaria elegans var. maritima, commonly known as the sea orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to coastal regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or along rocky shores. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomes are adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it well-suited to its harsh maritime environment.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this species is considered threatened in many areas.</p>
