                    <h1>Holcus avenaceus var. bulbosus</h1>
<p>Holcus avenaceus var. bulbosus, commonly known as the bulbous meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and dense, tufted foliage.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil.</p>
<p>The variety is distinguished by its bulbous base, which allows it to survive in fluctuating environmental conditions.</p>
