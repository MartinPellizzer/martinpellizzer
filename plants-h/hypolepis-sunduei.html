The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or swampy areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of root hairs, which aid in water absorption.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a distinctive, almost lace-like appearance that contributes to its ornamental value.</p>
