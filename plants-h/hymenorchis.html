                    <h1>Hymenorchis</h1>
<p>Hymenorchis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a genus of orchids native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>These plants are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Hymenorchis species typically have small, delicate flowers that are often white or pale in color, with intricate patterns that resemble ghostly shapes. They thrive in humid, shaded environments and require specific conditions to bloom.</p>
<p>Due to their rarity and habitat specificity, many species of Hymenorchis are threatened by habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
