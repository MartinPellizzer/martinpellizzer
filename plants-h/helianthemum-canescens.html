                    <h1>Helianthemum canescens</h1>
<p>Helianthemum canescens, commonly known as the silver thyme or woolly rockrose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to a thick layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and coastal gardens.</p>
