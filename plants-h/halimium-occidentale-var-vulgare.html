<p>Halimium occidentale var. vulgare, commonly known as the Western sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise sparse foliage. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to harsh climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its natural habitat.</p>
