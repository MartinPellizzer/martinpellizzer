<p>Hypolepis glandulosopilosa, commonly known as the hairy-leaf sword fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in small, glandular hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the undersides of the mature fronds.</p>
