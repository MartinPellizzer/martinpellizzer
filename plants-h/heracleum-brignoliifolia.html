                    <h1>Heracleum brignoliifolia</h1>
<p>Heracleum brignoliifolia, commonly known as the Sicilian cow parsnip, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbrella-shaped inflorescences and aromatic foliage.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Europe, particularly Sicily, and thrives in moist, calcareous soils. The plant features large, pinnately divided leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length, and its flowers are typically white or pale green. It is often found in wetlands, riverbanks, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
