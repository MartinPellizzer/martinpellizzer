                    <h1>Hoodia langii</h1>
<p>Hoodia langii, commonly known as the desert lily, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, minimizing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Hoodia langii is also noted for its potential medicinal properties, particularly in relation to appetite suppression.</p>
