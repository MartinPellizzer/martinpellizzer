<p>Hedysarum obscurum var. boutignyanum, commonly known as the dark-hedysarum or Boutigny's hedysarum, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features compound leaves with stipules and small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant produces slender, cylindrical pods containing several seeds, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
