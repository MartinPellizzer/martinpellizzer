                    <h1>Hesperocodon hederaceus</h1>
<p>Hesperocodon hederaceus, commonly known as the ivy-like dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Convolvulaceae and produces small, inconspicuous white or yellow flowers. The plant has slender, thread-like stems that twine around its hosts, often forming dense mats. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it can thrive in a variety of environments where suitable hosts are present.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can be a concern for agricultural and horticultural crops.</p>
