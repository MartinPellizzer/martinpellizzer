                    <h1>Hippomarathrum cristatum var. pauciradiatum</h1>
<p>Hippomarathrum cristatum var. pauciradiatum, commonly known as the spiny cactus or desert cactus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a splash of color to the desert landscape. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>The species is adapted to high temperatures and low precipitation, making it a hardy example of desert flora.</p>
