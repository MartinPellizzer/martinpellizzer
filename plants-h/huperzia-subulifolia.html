                    <h1>Huperzia subulifolia</h1>
<p>Huperzia subulifolia, commonly known as the needle fern, is a species of clubmoss belonging to the family Huperziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Native to various regions in the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant reproduces via spores rather than seeds, typical of its ancient lineage of vascular plants.</p>
<p>Its simple, primitive structure reflects its evolutionary history as a member of the lycophytes.</p>
