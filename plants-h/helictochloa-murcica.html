<p>Helictochloa murcica, commonly known as the Murcian needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe, particularly found in Spain and southern France.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or semi-arid habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
