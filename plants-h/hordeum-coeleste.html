<p>Hordeum coeleste, commonly known as blue barley, is a species of wild barley native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue-green coloration, which is due to the presence of a unique pigment called coelestin. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a panicle, with each spikelet containing two to three florets.</p>
<p>Hordeum coeleste is not only ornamental but also has been studied for its potential medicinal properties.</p>
