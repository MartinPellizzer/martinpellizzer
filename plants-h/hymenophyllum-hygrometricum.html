<p>Hymenophyllum hygrometricum, commonly known as the moisture-sensitive moss, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are covered with a dense layer of rhizoids, which help anchor it to substrates and absorb moisture.</p>
<p>The plant is notable for its ability to respond to changes in humidity, closing its leaves when dry and opening them when wet.</p>
