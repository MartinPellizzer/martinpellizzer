                    <h1>Habenaria carnea var. nivosa</h1>
<p>Habenaria carnea var. nivosa, commonly known as the snow-lip orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers with a distinctive, lip-like structure that resembles a snowy lip, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments such as cloud forests and alpine meadows. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, clustered blooms during the spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
