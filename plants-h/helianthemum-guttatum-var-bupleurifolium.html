                    <h1>Helianthemum guttatum var. bupleurifolium</h1>
<p>Helianthemum guttatum var. bupleurifolium, commonly known as the bupleurifolium stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a bright touch to rocky or gravelly habitats. Its compact growth habit makes it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The variety is distinguished by its broader, more lobed leaves compared to the typical form of Helianthemum guttatum.</p>
