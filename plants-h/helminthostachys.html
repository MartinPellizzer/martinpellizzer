                    <h1>Helminthostachys</h1>
<p>Helminthostachys, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Helminthostachys is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
