<p>Hoodia annulata, commonly known as the desert cabbage, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the early morning. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Hoodia annulata is also known for its potential appetite-suppressing properties, making it a subject of interest in scientific research.</p>
