                    <h1>Hedeoma quercetora</h1>
<p>Hedeoma quercetora, commonly known as the redroot sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. The plant has small, clustered leaves and produces clusters of pink or white flowers in the spring. Its root system is fibrous and can spread to form dense mats, which helps it colonize poor soils effectively.</p>
<p>Hedeoma quercetora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid environments.</p>
