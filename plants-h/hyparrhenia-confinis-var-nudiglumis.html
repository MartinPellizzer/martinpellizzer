                    <h1>Hyparrhenia confinis var. nudiglumis</h1>
<p>Hyparrhenia confinis var. nudiglumis, commonly known as the slender flat sedge, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and seasonally flooded areas, where it forms dense, grass-like clumps. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming extensive mats.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its smooth, glabrous lemma, contributing to its unique botanical appearance.</p>
