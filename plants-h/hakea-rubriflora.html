<p>Hakea rubriflora, commonly known as the red-flowered hakea, is a shrub native to the southwestern region of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage and striking red flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant produces woody, cone-like structures called follicles, which contain the seeds. Hakea rubriflora is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing features such as thick, waxy leaves to reduce water loss.</p>
