<p>Hieracium mollitum var. enginense, commonly known as the soft hawkweed, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, low-growing stems and clusters of small, yellowish to reddish flowers. The leaves are typically broad, lobed, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its soft texture. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides.</p>
