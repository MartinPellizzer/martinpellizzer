<p>Hypochaeris variegata var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, bright yellow flowers with four petals, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. The plant has a rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine, white hairs. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, roadsides, and other sunny, open areas.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to self-seed make it a common weed in cultivated landscapes.</p>
