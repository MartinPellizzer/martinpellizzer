The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its leaves are typically narrow, gray-green, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Hymenopappus niveus is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
