                    <h1>Hydnophytum tortuosum</h1>
<p>Hydnophytum tortuosum, commonly known as the spiral pitcher plant, is a unique epiphytic plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive spiral-shaped inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, pitcher-like structures that trap and digest insects, contributing to its nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor environments. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing its ability to thrive in shaded, humid conditions.</p>
<p>Hydnophytum tortuosum is also notable for its ability to retain water in its leaves, aiding in survival during dry periods.</p>
