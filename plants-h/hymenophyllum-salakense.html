<p>Hymenophyllum salakense, commonly known as the Salakense filmy fern, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective membrane.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum salakense is notable for its intricate leaf structure and is often found in rainforests across Southeast Asia.</p>
