<p>Hammada eriantha, commonly known as the desert holly, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, spiny leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water, featuring a deep root system and waxy leaf surfaces to reduce water loss. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Hammada eriantha is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
