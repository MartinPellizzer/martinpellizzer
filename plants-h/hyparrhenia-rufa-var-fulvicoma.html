<p>Hyparrhenia rufa var. fulvicoma, commonly known as the yellow panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a yellowish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands.</p>
<p>Its fibrous root system makes it drought-tolerant and suitable for erosion control in certain environments.</p>
