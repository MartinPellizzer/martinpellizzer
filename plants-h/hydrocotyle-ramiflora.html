<p>Hydrocotyle ramiflora, commonly known as the creeping water pennywort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are often floating or submerged, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered near the water's surface. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle ramiflora is often used in ornamental water gardens due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various water conditions.</p>
