                    <h1>Hypericum hircinum var. minus</h1>
<p>Hypericum hircinum var. minus, commonly known as lesser St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has opposite, linear to oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and can be found in woodland edges, meadows, and rocky areas.</p>
<p>This variety is similar to the more common Hypericum hircinum but is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact growth habit.</p>
