                    <h1>Hoya elegans</h1>
<p>Hoya elegans, commonly known as the "Wax Plant" or "Floral Crown," is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of star-shaped flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without being parasitic. Hoya elegans thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
