<p>Hibiscus aridicola var. glabratus, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and dark green, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the cooler months. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its leaves and stems.</p>
<p>This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates.</p>
