                    <h1>Hippuris vulgaris</h1>
<p>Hippuris vulgaris, commonly known as the water cowpea, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that grow in dense mats on the water surface. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by distinctive, horse-chestnut-like fruits that split open to release seeds. Its root system helps stabilize sediments, making it valuable in wetland restoration.</p>
<p>Hippuris vulgaris is also used in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from contaminated water.</p>
