                    <h1>Helianthemum × siberi</h1>
<p>Helianthemum × siberi, commonly known as the Siberian rockrose, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wool, which helps to reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Helianthemum × siberi is also valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in colder climates.</p>
