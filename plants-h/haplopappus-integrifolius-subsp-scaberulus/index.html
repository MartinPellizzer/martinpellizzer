                            <h1>Haplopappus Integrifolius Subsp. Scaberulus</h1>
<p>Smoothleaf haplopappus, scientifically known as Haplopappus integrifolius subsp. scaberulus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. This subspecies is characterized by its smooth, waxy leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this unique plant from habitat loss and climate impacts.</p>
