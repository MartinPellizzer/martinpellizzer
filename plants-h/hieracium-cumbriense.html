<p>Hieracium cumbriense, commonly known as the Cumbrian hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the British Isles, particularly found in the Lake District and other upland areas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic grasslands and rocky soils, preferring cool and shaded environments. It produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers from June to August, and its leaves are rough and hairy, often with a serrated margin.</p>
<p>Hieracium cumbriense is a relatively rare species, and its conservation status is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution.</p>
