                    <h1>Halocnemum nodulosum</h1>
<p>Halocnemum nodulosum, commonly known as the saltbush, is a halophytic shrub adapted to arid and saline environments.</p>
<p>It thrives in coastal areas, salt lakes, and other regions with high salinity. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss and help it survive in harsh conditions. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Halocnemum nodulosum plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in saline ecosystems.</p>
