<p>Hoarea triphylla, commonly known as the three-leaf hoba, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences.
