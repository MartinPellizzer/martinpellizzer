<p>Heteromalla paniculata f. velutina, commonly known as the velvet panicled bellflower, is a rare and striking plant native to specific regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its velvety, hairy foliage and striking clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests or rocky slopes. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its natural range.</p>
