                    <h1>Hemionitis tomentosa</h1>
<p>Hemionitis tomentosa, commonly known as the wooly bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to the northeastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of fine hairs on its leaves, which help reduce water loss and protect against herbivores. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and bogs. Its leaves are submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface.</p>
<p>Hemionitis tomentosa produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
