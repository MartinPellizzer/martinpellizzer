<p>Hieracium nigrescens subsp.</p>
<p>dubiosum, commonly known as the doubtful hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and basal rosette of leaves.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as meadows and roadsides. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in leaf shape and flower structure.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that can spread through rhizomes, making it somewhat invasive in certain regions.</p>
