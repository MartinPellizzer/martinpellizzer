<p>Hieracium subtilissimum subsp.</p>
<p>penninicola, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, including rocky slopes and grasslands at high altitudes.</p>
<p>The plant features a rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow flower heads with ray florets. It is characterized by its small stature and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species of alpine environments.</p>
