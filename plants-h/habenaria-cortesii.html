                    <h1>Habenaria cortesii</h1>
<p>Habenaria cortesii, commonly known as the Cortes's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it can receive adequate light without direct sun exposure. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with a unique coloration pattern, featuring a white lip and purple or pink sepals. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the forest floor, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for successful germination and growth.</p>
<p>This orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitats.</p>
