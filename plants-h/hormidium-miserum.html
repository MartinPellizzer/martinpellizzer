                    <h1>Hormidium miserum</h1>
<p>Hormidium miserum, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hormidium miserum has adapted to extreme drought conditions through a deep root system and reduced leaf surface area.</p>
<p>Its resilience makes it an important component of desert ecosystems and a subject of study in xerophyte botany.</p>
