                    <h1>Heliamphora purpurascens</h1>
<p>Heliamphora purpurascens, commonly known as the purple pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the tepuis of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a sticky liquid to trap and digest insects. The plant thrives in high-altitude, nutrient-poor environments, relying on insect prey for essential nutrients. Its vibrant purple coloration is due to high concentrations of anthocyanins, which also help protect the plant from intense sunlight.</p>
<p>The structure of its pitchers is adapted for both water retention and efficient prey capture, making it a unique example of botanical adaptation.</p>
