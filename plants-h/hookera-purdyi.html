                    <h1>Hookera purdyi</h1>
<p>Hookera purdyi, commonly known as the Purdy's hooker, is a rare alpine plant native to the Andes Mountains.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in dense, white, woolly hair, which helps to insulate it from cold temperatures. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hookera purdyi is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
