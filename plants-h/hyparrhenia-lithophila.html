<p>Hyparrhenia lithophila, commonly known as the rock grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.

Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically arranged in spikelets, and it produces small, three-angled fruits.</p>
<p>Hyparrhenia lithophila is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in restoration projects due to its resilience.</p>
