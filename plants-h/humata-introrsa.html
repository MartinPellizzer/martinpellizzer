                    <h1>Humata introrsa</h1>
<p>Humata introrsa, commonly known as the inward-facing humata, is a unique flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that face inward, a feature that aids in pollination by specific insect species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are broad and glossy, often with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Humata introrsa is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
