                    <h1>Heterothalamus</h1>
<p>Heterothalamus, commonly known as the "false morel," is a type of fungus rather than a plant, so it does not have botanical aspects in the traditional sense.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gyromitraceae and is characterized by its distinctive, irregular cap shape and spore-producing structure. The fungus contains toxic compounds, including gyromitrin, which can be harmful to humans and animals. It is typically found in forested areas, growing on decaying wood or soil.</p>
<p>Despite its name, it is not related to true morels and is often confused with them due to similar appearance.</p>
