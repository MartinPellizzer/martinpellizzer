                            <h1>Hypericum Impunctatum</h1>
<p>Common st. john's wort, scientifically known as Hypericum impunctatum, is a hardy perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and glossy green leaves that thrive in sunny to partially shaded environments. This plant is often found in meadows, woodlands, and rocky areas, where it spreads through its rhizomatous roots. Its medicinal properties have been studied for centuries, with potential uses in treating mild depression and anxiety. Despite its benefits, it is important to note that it can be toxic to livestock if ingested in large quantities.</p>
