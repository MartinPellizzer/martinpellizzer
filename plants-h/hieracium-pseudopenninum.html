<p>Hieracium pseudopenninum, commonly known as the Alpine groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
