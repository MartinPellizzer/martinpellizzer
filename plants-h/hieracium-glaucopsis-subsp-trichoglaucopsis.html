<p>Hieracium glaucopsis subsp.</p>
<p>trichoglaucopsis, commonly known as the glaucous hawkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in a whitish or bluish waxy coating, known as a glaucous bloom.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the daisy family. It is typically found in moist meadows and along stream banks in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in the density and structure of its pubescence.</p>
