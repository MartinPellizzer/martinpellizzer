                    <h1>Haplopappus ferrisiae</h1>
<p>Haplopappus ferrisiae, commonly known as the desert pappus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and adaptive features for survival in harsh environments. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and has a low, sprawling growth habit to minimize water loss. Its small, yellowish flowers are followed by fluffy pappus structures that aid in wind dispersal of its seeds.</p>
<p>Haplopappus ferrisiae is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
