<p>Hedysarum prostratum, commonly known as creeping sainfoin, is a low-growing perennial legume native to regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its trifoliate leaves consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
<p>Hedysarum prostratum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and soil-stabilizing properties.</p>
