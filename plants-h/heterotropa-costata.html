<p>Heterotropa costata, commonly known as the serrated bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rootless, floating stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are thin and ribbon-like, often with a serrated edge, and it produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers.</p>
<p>Heterotropa costata is a carnivorous plant that supplements its nutrient intake by digesting trapped prey.</p>
