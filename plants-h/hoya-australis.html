                <h1>Hoya australis</h1>
<p>Hoya australis, commonly known as the wax plant or Australian wisteria, is a tropical vine native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often variegated with white and green patterns. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink, which bloom in late winter or early spring. Hoya australis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
