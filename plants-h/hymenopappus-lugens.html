<p>Hymenopappus lugens, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive bract structures. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Hymenopappus lugens is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils with minimal water availability.</p>
