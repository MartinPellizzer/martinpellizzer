<p>Helianthemum glaucum var. procumbens, commonly known as the creeping sunflower, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that are typically covered in a whitish, powdery coating called a bloom, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and coastal gardens.</p>
