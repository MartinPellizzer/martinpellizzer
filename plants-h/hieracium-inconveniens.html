                    <h1>Hieracium inconveniens</h1>
<p>Hieracium inconveniens, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. The plant is native to Europe and has been introduced to other parts of the world, often becoming invasive in certain regions. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it a notable weed in agricultural and natural settings.</p>
