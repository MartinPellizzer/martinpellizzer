                    <h1>Hopia</h1>
<p>Hopia, commonly known as the hop plant, is a climbing shrub native to Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Humulus, which includes two species: Humulus lupulus and Humulus japonicus. The plant is characterized by its long, twisting stems and clusters of small, cone-like flowers called strobiles. These strobiles contain lupulin, a substance rich in bitter compounds used in brewing beer.</p>
<p>Hopia is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p>
