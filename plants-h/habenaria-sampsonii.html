                    <h1>Habenaria sampsonii</h1>
<p>Habenaria sampsonii, commonly known as the Sampson's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in seasonal habitats. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>The species is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
