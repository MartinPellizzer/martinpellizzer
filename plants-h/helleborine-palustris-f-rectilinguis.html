<p>Helleborine palustris f. rectilinguis, commonly known as the swamp helleborine, is a rare and striking orchid species native to wetland habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and pale greenish-white flowers with intricate markings. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as bogs and marshes, where it thrives in acidic soils. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is known for its delicate, spurred petals that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
