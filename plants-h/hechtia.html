                    <h1>Hechtia</h1>
<p>Hechtia, commonly known as the "Mexican hat" or "false heather," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Bromeliaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to Mexico and Central America, where they typically grow in shaded, humid environments. Hechtia species are characterized by their rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, a feature common among bromeliads. The flowers, which are often brightly colored, emerge from the center of the rosette and can last for several weeks.</p>
<p>They are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
