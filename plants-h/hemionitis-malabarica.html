                    <h1>Hemionitis malabarica</h1>
<p>Hemionitis malabarica, commonly known as the Malabar fern, is a rare and endangered plant native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brownish spores. Its reproductive structures are located on the underside of the fronds, and it relies on specific microclimatic conditions for successful growth.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
