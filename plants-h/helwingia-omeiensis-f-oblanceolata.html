<p>Helwingia omeiensis f. oblanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed helwingia, is a rare evergreen shrub native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, glossy leaves that are often tinged with red on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
