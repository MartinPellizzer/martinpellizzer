<p>Hydrocotyle trachycarpa, commonly known as the roughleaf water shield, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has floating leaves that are round and covered with tiny, rough-textured hairs, which give it its common name. Its small white flowers bloom in late summer, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by water.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle trachycarpa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
