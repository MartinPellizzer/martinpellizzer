                    <h1>Herschelianthe lugens var. nigrescens</h1>
<p>Herschelianthe lugens var. nigrescens, commonly known as the black-hued desert shrub, is a perennial plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its striking contrast between its dark foliage and bright floral display.</p>
