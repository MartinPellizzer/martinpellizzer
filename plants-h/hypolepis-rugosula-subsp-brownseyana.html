<p>Hypolepis rugosula subsp.</p>
<p>brownseyana, commonly known as the Brownsey's shield fern, is a fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a rough, textured surface.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, and it reproduces primarily through spore dispersal.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its distinctive appearance and is a common sight in the native flora of New Zealand's forests.</p>
