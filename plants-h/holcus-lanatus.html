                    <h1>Holcus lanatus</h1>
<p>Holcus lanatus, commonly known as hairy bittercress, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, hairy stems and alternate leaves that are typically lance-shaped with a hairy underside. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal, it is considered a common weed in many regions.</p>
