                    <h1>Haemocarpus paniculatus</h1>
<p>Haemocarpus paniculatus, commonly known as the swamp grass or swamp panic, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, white to pale green flowers, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common component of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems.</p>
