<p>Hieracium corynodes, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellow flowers and is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it can form dense mats due to its rhizomatous growth habit. It has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces numerous small, daisy-like flowers in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Hieracium corynodes is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
