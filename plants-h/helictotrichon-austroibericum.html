<p>Helictotrichon austroibericum, commonly known as the Spanish bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to southern Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>
