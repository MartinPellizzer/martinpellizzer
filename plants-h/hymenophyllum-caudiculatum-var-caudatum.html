<p>Hymenophyllum caudiculatum var. caudatum, commonly known as the slender toothed fern, is a member of the Hymenophyllaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, linear leaves with finely toothed margins, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It is native to regions of Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in some areas.</p>
