                    <h1>Holcus redolens</h1>
<p>Holcus redolens, commonly known as the sweet vernal grass, is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands.</p>
<p>It features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its leaves emit a sweet, honey-like scent, especially when crushed, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>Holcus redolens is an important plant for pollinators and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
