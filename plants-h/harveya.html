<p>Harveya, commonly known as the "painted orchid," is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to the Andes Mountains in South America, where they thrive in high-altitude environments. Harveya species are characterized by their striking, often brightly colored flowers that resemble orchids, though they are not closely related to true orchids. The plants typically grow as terrestrial or epiphytic herbs, with fleshy roots and narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>Their unique floral structures and vibrant hues make them popular among orchid enthusiasts and botanists alike.</p>
