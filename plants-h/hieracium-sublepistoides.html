                    <h1>Hieracium sublepistoides</h1>
<p>Hieracium sublepistoides, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which help reduce water loss in its native habitats. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typical of the dandelion family. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain regions.</p>
