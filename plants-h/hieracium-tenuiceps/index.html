                            <h1>Hieracium Tenuiceps</h1>
<p>Hieracium tenuiceps, commonly known as the slender-headed hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and ragworts. This species is characterized by its tall, slender stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. It often grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Despite its modest appearance, it plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance.</p>
