                    <h1>Holcus grurnosus</h1>
<p>Holcus grurnosus, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and silver-gray foliage due to the presence of dense pubescence on its leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Its flowers are small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny seeds.</p>
<p>Holcus grurnosus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its ability to thrive in shaded conditions.</p>
