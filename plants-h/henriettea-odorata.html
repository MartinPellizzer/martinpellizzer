                    <h1>Henriettea odorata</h1>
<p>Henriettea odorata, commonly known as the sweet-scented fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that emit a subtle, fragrant aroma. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its unique scent is attributed to the presence of volatile organic compounds in its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Henriettea odorata is considered an endangered species.</p>
