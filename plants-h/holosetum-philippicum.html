<p>Holosetum philippicum, commonly known as the Philippine water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, and is often found in shaded, still waters. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Holosetum philippicum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water quality through its filtration capabilities.</p>
