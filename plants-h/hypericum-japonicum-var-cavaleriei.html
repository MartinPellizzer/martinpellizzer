<p>Hypericum japonicum var. cavaleriei, commonly known as the Japanese St. John's Wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its compact form. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for temperate climates.</p>
<p>Its medicinal properties, similar to other Hypericum species, have also been studied for potential therapeutic uses.</p>
