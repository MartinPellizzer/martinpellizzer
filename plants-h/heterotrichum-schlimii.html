<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, greenish-yellow stems that are often covered in a layer of tiny, translucent cells. The leaves are linear, with a narrow, elongated shape and a slightly curled tip, and they are arranged closely along the stem. This moss thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions with cool, humid climates.</p>
<p>Its delicate structure and ability to retain moisture make it an important component of forest floor ecosystems.</p>
