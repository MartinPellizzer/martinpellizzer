                    <h1>Holcoglossum junceum</h1>
<p>Holcoglossum junceum, commonly known as the golden humphead orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, yellowish-green pseudobulbs and its distinctive, showy flowers that resemble a humpbacked head. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, contributing to its common name, while its flowers bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
