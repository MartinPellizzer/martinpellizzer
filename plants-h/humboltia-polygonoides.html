                    <h1>Humboltia polygonoides</h1>
<p>Humboltia polygonoides, commonly known as the white-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of white, tubular flowers. The plant attaches to its host trees through specialized roots called haustoria, which extract water and nutrients. It produces small, fleshy fruits that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Humboltia polygonoides is typically found in arid and semi-arid environments, growing on the branches of various host trees.</p>
