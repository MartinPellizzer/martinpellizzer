                    <h1>Heterogonium rufescens</h1>
<p>Heterogonium rufescens, commonly known as the red heterogonium, is a species of algae belonging to the order Rhodophyta.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reddish pigmentation due to the presence of phycoerythrin, which allows it to absorb light at deeper water levels. The plant typically forms filamentous structures with branching thallus, and its cells are multinucleate. It thrives in marine environments, particularly in coastal areas with moderate to high salinity.</p>
<p>Heterogonium rufescens plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and serving as a food source for various marine organisms.</p>
