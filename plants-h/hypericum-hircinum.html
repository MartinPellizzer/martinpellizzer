                    <h1>Hypericum hircinum</h1>
<p>Hypericum hircinum, commonly known as goatweed, is a flowering plant in the family Hypericaceae.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in summer, and it is often adorned with red or orange stamens that give it a striking appearance. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are woody and somewhat branched.</p>
<p>Hypericum hircinum is also known for its historical use in traditional medicine, though its medicinal properties are not as well-documented as those of Hypericum perforatum.</p>
