                    <h1>Herniaria hartungii</h1>
<p>Herniaria hartungii, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and rocky habitats in southern Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces tiny, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in loose, mineral-rich soils.</p>
<p>Herniaria hartungii is often found in disturbed or barren areas, showcasing its resilience to extreme conditions.</p>
