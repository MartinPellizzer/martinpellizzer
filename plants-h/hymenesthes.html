                    <h1>Hymenesthes</h1>
<p>Hymenesthes, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a genus of aquatic plants native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their floating leaves and showy, pink or white flowers that bloom above the water surface. Hymenesthes species are often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Their leaves are thick and waxy, helping them float and resist water damage.</p>
<p>The flowers are pollinated by insects and produce small, round fruits that contain seeds.</p>
