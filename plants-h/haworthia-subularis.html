                    <h1>Haworthia subularis</h1>
<p>Haworthia subularis, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of thick, fleshy, light green leaves with distinctive white to pale blue markings that resemble zebra stripes. The plant produces small, star-shaped white flowers on tall, thin stems during the warmer months. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
