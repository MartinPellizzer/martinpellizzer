<p>Hieronymiella aurea, commonly known as the golden moss cushion, is a rare and delicate plant belonging to the family Lejeuneaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and vibrant golden-yellow coloration, which is most prominent in its mature leaves. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in high-altitude cloud forests. Its small, intricate leaves are covered in fine, papillae-like structures that aid in water retention.</p>
