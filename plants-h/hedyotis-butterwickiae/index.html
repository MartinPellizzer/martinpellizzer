                            <h1>Hedyotis Butterwickiae</h1>
<p>Hedyotis butterwickiae is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of New Zealand. This evergreen shrub is known for its vibrant, showy flowers that bloom in shades of red and orange. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in forested areas with rich, well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive. Its unique beauty and ecological importance make it a valuable subject for botanical study and preservation.</p>
