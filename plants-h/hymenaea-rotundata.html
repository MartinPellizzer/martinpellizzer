                    <h1>Hymenaea rotundata</h1>
<p>Hymenaea rotundata, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, dark brown seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its rich color and fine grain, though it is now protected due to overharvesting.</p>
<p>The plant also has medicinal uses in traditional medicine, particularly for its anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
