                    <h1>Herniaria fruticosa var. hemistemon</h1>
<p>Herniaria fruticosa var. hemistemon, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant characterized by its small, succulent leaves and clusters of tiny white flowers.</p>
<p>It is typically found in sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or arid environments. The plant has a dense root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which reduces water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
