                    <h1>Hemionitis wrightii</h1>
<p>Hemionitis wrightii, commonly known as Wright's hemionitis, is a rare and delicate fern native to the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in rocky crevices or along streambanks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health.</p>
