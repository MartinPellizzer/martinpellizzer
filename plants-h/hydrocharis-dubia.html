<p>Hydrocharis dubia, commonly known as the lesser water clover, is a small aquatic plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. The plant has floating leaves that are divided into small, oval-shaped segments, giving it a clover-like appearance. Its flowers are small, white, and borne on short stalks, often emerging above the water surface.</p>
<p>Hydrocharis dubia plays a role in water purification by absorbing nutrients and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
