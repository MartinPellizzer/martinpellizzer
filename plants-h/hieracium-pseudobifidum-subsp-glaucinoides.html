<p>Hieracium pseudobifidum subsp.</p>
<p>glaucinoides, commonly known as the glaucous hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands, and it is known for its distinctive blue to purple flower heads. Its leaves are usually hairy and have a rough texture, while the stems are upright and branching.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its glaucous (waxy, bluish) coating on the leaves and bracts, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
