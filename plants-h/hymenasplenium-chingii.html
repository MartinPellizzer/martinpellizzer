<p>Hymenasplenium chingii, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a rare aquatic fern species native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and rice fields, where it forms dense floating mats. The plant has finely divided, needle-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption from the water.</p>
<p>Hymenasplenium chingii plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering impurities and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
