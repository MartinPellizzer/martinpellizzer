                    <h1>Hemianemia pyrenea</h1>
<p>Hemianemia pyrenea, commonly known as the fire blight of hemlock, is a fungal disease caused by the pathogen *Pseudomonas syringae* pv.</p>
<p>*hemlyca*. It primarily affects the foliage and branches of hemlock trees, leading to discoloration, wilting, and eventual dieback.</p>
<p>The disease is characterized by the appearance of blackened, necrotic lesions on the bark and foliage, often resembling a scorched or burned appearance. It spreads through rain splashes and contaminated tools, making it a significant threat to hemlock populations in forested areas.</p>
<p>Management strategies include pruning infected branches, applying bactericides, and planting resistant species to mitigate its impact.</p>
