                    <h1>Hymenochaeta lacustris</h1>
<p>Hymenochaeta lacustris, commonly known as the water stinkhorn, is a unique fungus that thrives in moist, decaying organic matter near water bodies.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, foul-smelling cap that attracts flies for spore dispersal. The fungus has a short life cycle, typically appearing in late summer and early autumn. Its fruiting bodies are often found in damp soil or on decaying wood near lakes and rivers.</p>
<p>Hymenochaeta lacustris plays a role in decomposing organic material and recycling nutrients in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.</p>
