                    <h1>Heracleum argaeum</h1>
<p>Heracleum argaeum, commonly known as the Caucasian cow parsnip, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, umbrella-like compound leaves.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia, where it thrives in moist, temperate climates. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in complex umbels, which are typical of the carrot family. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>However, like many members of its genus, it can be toxic if ingested in large quantities.</p>
