                    <h1>Haworthia venusta</h1>
<p>Haworthia venusta, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact rosette of fleshy, bluish-green leaves with distinctive white or yellow markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant produces tall, slender flower stems with tubular white or yellow flowers during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
