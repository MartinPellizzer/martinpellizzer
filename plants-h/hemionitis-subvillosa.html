                    <h1>Hemionitis subvillosa</h1>
<p>Hemionitis subvillosa, commonly known as the woolly hemionitis, is a rare and delicate fern native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, hairy fronds that give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are pollinated by wind, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
