                    <h1>Herniaria paniculata</h1>
<p>Herniaria paniculata, commonly known as the sand pearl or sea sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes and coastal cliffs, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. The plant features small, bright green, succulent-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of tiny white or pink flowers arranged in panicles.</p>
<p>Herniaria paniculata is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in harsh coastal environments.</p>
