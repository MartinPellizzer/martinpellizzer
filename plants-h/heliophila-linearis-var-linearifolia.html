<p>Heliophila linearis var. linearifolia, commonly known as slender waterplantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, linear leaves that are typically less than 2 cm wide, arranged in a basal rosette and often submerged or floating in shallow water. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in spikes during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams.</p>
<p>Heliophila linearis var. linearifolia plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for invertebrates and contributing to water filtration.</p>
