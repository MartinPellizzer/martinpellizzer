<p>Hesperevax caulescens, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Hesperevax caulescens plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in disturbed or sandy soils.</p>
