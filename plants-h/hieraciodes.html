                    <h1>Hieraciodes</h1>
<p>Hieraciodes, commonly known as alpine lady's-mantle, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in alpine and arctic regions, where they thrive in cold, rocky environments. They are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to insulate the plant and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Hieraciodes species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in rock gardens.</p>
