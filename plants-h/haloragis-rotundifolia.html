                    <h1>Haloragis rotundifolia</h1>
<p>Haloragis rotundifolia, commonly known as the roundleaf water-starwort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and wet meadows. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces tiny, greenish flowers that bloom in early summer. Its roots help stabilize sediment, contributing to water clarity and habitat for aquatic life.</p>
<p>Haloragis rotundifolia is adapted to fluctuating water levels and can tolerate both submerged and emergent conditions.</p>
