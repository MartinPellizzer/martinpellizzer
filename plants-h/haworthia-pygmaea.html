<p>Haworthia pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf Haworthia, is a small, compact succulent native to South Africa.</p>

The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the spring or early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and rock gardens.</p>
