                    <h1>Hymenotheca cotinifolia</h1>
<p>Hymenotheca cotinifolia, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage in the fall, which is a result of the breakdown of chlorophyll and the expression of pigments like anthocyanins. The plant has opposite, palmately lobed leaves that are typically 5â€“9 cm in length. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters, while the fruit is a samara, a type of winged seed pod.</p>
<p>The tree is well-adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in forested areas.</p>
