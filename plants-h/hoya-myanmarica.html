                    <h1>Hoya myanmarica</h1>
<p>Hoya myanmarica, commonly known as the Myanmar Waffleplant, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and clusters of waxy, waffle-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming during the summer months. Hoya myanmarica thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
