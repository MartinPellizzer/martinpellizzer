                    <h1>Heteranthia</h1>
<p>Heteranthia, commonly known as the heteranthous condition, refers to a botanical feature where a flower has stamens of different sizes or shapes.</p>
<p>This variation is often observed in certain plant families, such as the Fabaceae. The heteranthous condition can play a role in pollination by attracting specific pollinators through visual or structural cues. It is a result of genetic diversity and evolutionary adaptations within the plant species.</p>
<p>This trait contributes to the overall reproductive strategy and ecological success of the plant.</p>
