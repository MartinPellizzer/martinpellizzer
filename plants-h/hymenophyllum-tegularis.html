                    <h1>Hymenophyllum tegularis</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum tegularis, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, moss-like fronds that are often covered in a thin layer of fine, hairy structures. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and they are protected by a specialized covering known as a hymenium.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its ability to tolerate low light and high moisture, making it a unique addition to moist, shaded gardens.</p>
