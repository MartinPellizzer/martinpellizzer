                    <h1>Hapalochilus immobilis</h1>
<p>Hapalochilus immobilis, commonly known as the immobile lichen, is a unique species of lichen that exhibits a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga.</p>
<p>This plant, though not a true plant in the botanical sense, is often studied for its ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on tree bark or rocks in temperate regions. The structure of Hapalochilus immobilis consists of a dense, crust-like thallus that is resistant to environmental stress.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and specialized adaptations make it an important indicator species for assessing environmental health.</p>
