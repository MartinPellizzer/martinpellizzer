                    <h1>Huperzia rostrifolia</h1>
<p>Huperzia rostrifolia, commonly known as the rostrifoliate huperzia, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in strobila, a structure typical of many ferns. Huperzia rostrifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
