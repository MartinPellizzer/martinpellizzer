<p>Huperzia marsupiiformis, commonly known as the broad-leaf huperzia, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are often clustered at the base of the plant. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas, and is native to regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. Its spore-bearing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in small, cup-like formations on the underside of the fronds.</p>
