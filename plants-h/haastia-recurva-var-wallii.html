                    <h1>Haastia recurva var. wallii</h1>
<p>Haastia recurva var. wallii, commonly known as the Wallis Haastia, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, rosette-shaped foliage that forms a tight, water-holding structure. The leaves are typically broad, stiff, and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing small, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish.</p>
