<p>Hicorius porcina var. reniformis, commonly known as the broadleaf hedgehog mushroom, is a variant of the hedgehog mushroom species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, irregularly shaped cap that often has a broad, kidney-like appearance. The cap is typically covered with small, spine-like projections, giving it a unique texture. The gills are attached to the stem and are initially pale but darken with age.</p>
<p>This variant is often found in association with certain tree species, particularly oaks, in forested areas.</p>
