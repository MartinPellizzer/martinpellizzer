                    <h1>Hymenophyllum microsorum</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum microsorum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the leaves in small, clustered structures called sori.</p>
