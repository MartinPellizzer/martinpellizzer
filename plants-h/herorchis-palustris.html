                    <h1>Herorchis palustris</h1>
<p>Herorchis palustris, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows up to 30â€“60 cm tall, with narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, showy spike of pale pink to purple flowers. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers bloom from June to August, and the plant plays an important role in supporting local pollinator populations.</p>
<p>Herorchis palustris is also valued for its ornamental appeal in wetland gardens.</p>
