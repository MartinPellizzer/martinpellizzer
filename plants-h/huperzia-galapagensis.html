                    <h1>Huperzia galapagensis</h1>
<p>Huperzia galapagensis, commonly known as the Galápagos huperzia, is a species of fern that is native to the Galápagos Islands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Huperziaceae and is characterized by its simple, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a unique component of the Galápagos flora.</p>
