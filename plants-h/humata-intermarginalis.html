<p>Humata intermarginalis, commonly known as the narrow-margin humata, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and finely divided, feather-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in late summer. Native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
