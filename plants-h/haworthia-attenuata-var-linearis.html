The leaves are typically linear and pointed, giving the plant a unique, geometric appearance. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers on tall, slender stalks during the growing season.</p>
<p>This species is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light.</p>
