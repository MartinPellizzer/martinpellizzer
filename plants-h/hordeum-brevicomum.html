                    <h1>Hordeum brevicomum</h1>
<p>Hordeum brevicomum, commonly known as dwarf barley, is a species of grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and short, sturdy stalks, typically reaching heights of less than 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing two-rowed grains, which are similar in structure to those of other barley species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Hordeum brevicomum is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
