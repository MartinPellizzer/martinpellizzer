<p>Hemicarpha schraderi, commonly known as Schrader's hemicarpha, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowering period usually occurs during the rainy season, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment.</p>
<p>Hemicarpha schraderi is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to thrive in degraded lands.</p>
