                    <h1>Helianthemum apenninum var. argentatum</h1>
<p>Helianthemum apenninum var. argentatum, commonly known as the silver-flowered rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, often in clusters at the ends of its branches. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone areas.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in landscaping.</p>
