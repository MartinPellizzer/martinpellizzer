<p>Hymenophyllum eriophorum, commonly known as the slender brake, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>

The plant belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is known for its unique, translucent spore cases called sporangia. It prefers to grow on rocks, tree trunks, or soil in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in humid, shaded forest understories.</p>
