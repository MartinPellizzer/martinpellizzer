                    <h1>Hydrocotyle ligulata</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle ligulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water shield, is a small aquatic plant found in freshwater wetlands.</p>
<p>It has heart-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize sediment and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle ligulata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits.</p>
