                    <h1>Hyparrhenia cymbaria</h1>
<p>Hyparrhenia cymbaria, commonly known as the African grass or dwarf couch grass, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Hyparrhenia cymbaria thrives in well-drained soils and is often used for erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive mats in suitable environments.</p>
