<p>Hieracium subcrassiforme, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and produces yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in some regions and can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
