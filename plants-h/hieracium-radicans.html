<p>Hieracium radicans, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a sprawling growth habit with rhizomatous stems that allow it to spread across the ground. The plant produces yellow composite flowers, which are made up of many small florets arranged in a flattened head. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture.</p>
<p>Hieracium radicans is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade.</p>
