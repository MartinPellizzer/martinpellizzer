The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in loose, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Hieraciodes depressa is often found in disturbed sites and is considered a characteristic species of desert scrub ecosystems.</p>
