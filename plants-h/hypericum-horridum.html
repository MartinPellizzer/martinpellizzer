<p>Hypericum horridum, commonly known as rough-stemmed St. John's wort, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant features yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, and its stems and leaves are covered in stiff, glandular hairs, giving it a rough texture. It has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, red-orange berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful.</p>
<p>Hypericum horridum is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antidepressant properties.</p>
