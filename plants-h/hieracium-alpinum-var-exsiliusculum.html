<p>Hieracium alpinum var. exsiliusculum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it forms dense mats or low-growing clumps. Its leaves are usually basal, with a rough, hairy texture, and its flowers are yellow, often with a reddish tinge at the base.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its smaller, more compact inflorescence compared to other members of the Hieracium genus.</p>
