                    <h1>Huernia clavigera var. maritima</h1>
<p>Huernia clavigera var. maritima, commonly known as the coastal horned cactus, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branching structure with fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>This variety is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found growing in coastal dunes or rocky outcrops.</p>
