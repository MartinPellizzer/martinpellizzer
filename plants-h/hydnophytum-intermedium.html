                    <h1>Hydnophytum intermedium</h1>
<p>Hydnophytum intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate hydnophytum, is a climbing plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its unique symbiotic relationship with ants. The plant produces specialized structures called "pseudopods" that house ant colonies, providing them with shelter and food. These ants, in turn, protect the plant from herbivores and competing plants.</p>
<p>Hydnophytum intermedium is often found in moist, shaded environments such as tropical forests.</p>
