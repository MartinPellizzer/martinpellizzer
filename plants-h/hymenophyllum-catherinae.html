<p>Hymenophyllum catherinae, commonly known as the cat's tail fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble the tail of a cat, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum catherinae is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant.</p>
