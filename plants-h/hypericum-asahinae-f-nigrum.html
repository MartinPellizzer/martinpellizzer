                    <h1>Hypericum asahinae f. nigrum</h1>
<p>Hypericum asahinae f. nigrum, commonly known as the black-stemmed St. John's wort, is a rare and unique variant of the St. John's wort genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black stems, which distinguish it from the typical green stems of other Hypericum species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with four petals, typical of the genus, and has elliptical, narrow leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique features, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
