<p>Haplopappus racemosus var. pinetorum, commonly known as the pinebrush horsebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in early spring. The plant has finely divided, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and pine forests.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various insects and small animals.</p>
