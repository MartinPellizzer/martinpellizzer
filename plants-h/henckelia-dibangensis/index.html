<p>Henckelia dibangensis is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the rainforests of Cameroon. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, known for its diverse and often ornamental species. This plant is notable for its striking, tubular flowers that bloom in vibrant shades of red and orange. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and faces threats from deforestation and climate change. Conservation efforts are crucial to ensure its survival in the wild.</p>
