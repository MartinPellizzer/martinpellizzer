                    <h1>Heteropolygonatum</h1>
<p>Heteropolygonatum, commonly known as the variable clubmoss, is a genus of primitive vascular plants belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are typically clustered at the tips of its branches. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Heteropolygonatum species are known for their ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils due to their efficient root systems.</p>
<p>These plants play an important role in ecological succession and soil stabilization in their habitats.</p>
