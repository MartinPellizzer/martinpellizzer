                    <h1>Hexarrhena</h1>
<p>Hexarrhena, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical Africa and is characterized by its nocturnal blooming habit, with large, showy white flowers that open at night. The flowers emit a strong, sweet fragrance to attract pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with smooth, often thornless stems.</p>
<p>Its leaves are opposite and ovate, often with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
