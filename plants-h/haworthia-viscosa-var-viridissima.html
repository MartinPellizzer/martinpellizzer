                    <h1>Haworthia viscosa var. viridissima</h1>
<p>Haworthia viscosa var. viridissima, commonly known as the Jade Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense rosettes of thick, fleshy, dark green leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces tall, sparsely branched stems with white flowers in late winter or early spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
