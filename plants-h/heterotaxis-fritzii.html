                    <h1>Heterotaxis fritzii</h1>
<p>Heterotaxis fritzii, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a unique fern species characterized by its distinctive, undulating fronds.</p>
<p>Its leaves are arranged in a spiral pattern, creating a zigzag appearance that sets it apart from other ferns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a rare trait among ferns, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
