<p>[WRONG START] Hymen Orchis tanii, commonly known as the Tanii's Orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a spurred lip and intricate petal arrangements. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its small, fragrant flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, adapted for pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Hymenorchis tanii is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
