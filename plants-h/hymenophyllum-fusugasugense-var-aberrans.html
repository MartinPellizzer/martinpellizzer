                    <h1>Hymenophyllum fusugasugense var. aberrans</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum fusugasugense var. aberrans, commonly known as the aberrant shield fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, moss-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found growing on rock surfaces or in dense forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the undersides of its leaves, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
