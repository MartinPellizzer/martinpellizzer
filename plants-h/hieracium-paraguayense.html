<p>Hieracium paraguayense, commonly known as Paraguay hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grasslands and disturbed soils, exhibiting a robust growth habit with hairy stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves.
