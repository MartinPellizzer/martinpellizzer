<p>Helichrysum chilense, commonly known as the Chilean everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, yellow-orange flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant produces small, tubular flowers surrounded by pale yellow ray florets, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature.</p>
<p>Helichrysum chilense is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in dry, sunny conditions.</p>
