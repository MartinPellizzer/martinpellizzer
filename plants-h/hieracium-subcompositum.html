<p>Hieracium subcompositum, commonly known as the composite hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its clustered inflorescence, which consists of numerous small yellow flowers arranged in a composite head. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Hieracium subcompositum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to colonize various habitats.</p>
