<p>Herminium alpinum, commonly known as the alpine twayblade, is a perennial orchid native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, preferring cool and moist conditions. Its rhizome system allows it to survive in harsh environments, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
<p>Herminium alpinum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
