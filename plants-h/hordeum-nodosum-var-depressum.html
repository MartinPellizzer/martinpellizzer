                    <h1>Hordeum nodosum var. depressum</h1>
<p>Hordeum nodosum var. depressum, commonly known as the nodding barley, is a variant of the barley species characterized by its distinctive nodding inflorescence.</p>
<p>This plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is typically found in grasslands and disturbed soils. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-like flowers that bend downward, giving it its characteristic appearance. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for studying grassland biodiversity and adaptation strategies.</p>
