<p>Hexadesmia crurigera, commonly known as the swamp morning glory, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in tropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant typically grows in marshy areas and is often found in association with other aquatic or semi-aquatic flora. Its vines can climb or trail along the ground, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds.</p>
<p>Hexadesmia crurigera plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
