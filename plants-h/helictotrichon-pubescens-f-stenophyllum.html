<p>Helictotrichon pubescens f. stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bluegrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its slender, dark green leaves that are narrower than the typical form.</p>
<p>It produces small, blue-green spikelets that are densely packed along the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is native to the northeastern United States and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks, where it forms dense, low-growing mats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens.</p>
