<p>Hystrix longe-aristata, commonly known as the long-spined hogweed, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its distinctive, branched stems and large, umbrella-like compound leaves.</p>
<p>The plant features long, stiff bristles along its stem and leaves, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in complex inflorescences, typical of the carrot family. The roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties.</p>
<p>Hystrix longe-aristata is native to arid and semi-arid regions, where it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats.</p>
