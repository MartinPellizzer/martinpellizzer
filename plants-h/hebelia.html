                    <h1>Hebelia</h1>
<p>Hebelia, commonly known as the rock heather, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or mountainous regions. Hebelia species are characterized by their low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, evergreen leaves. They produce clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple.</p>
<p>Due to their hardiness and ornamental value, Hebelia species are cultivated in gardens, especially in regions with mild, dry climates.</p>
