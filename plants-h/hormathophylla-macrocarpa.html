<p>Hormathophylla macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant waterfern, is a unique aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant has a specialized root system that allows it to anchor itself in muddy or sandy substrates in slow-moving or still water. Its fronds are divided into numerous small, finger-like segments called pinnae, which increase the surface area for photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Hormathophylla macrocarpa plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and shelter for various aquatic organisms.</p>
