<p>Homalosciadium homalocarpum, commonly known as the golden cup-moss, is a rare and unique liverwort species belonging to the family Ptilidiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, thalloid structure with a distinct, cup-shaped reproductive structure called a perianth. The plant exhibits a complex arrangement of gametophytic and sporophytic stages, typical of bryophytes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
