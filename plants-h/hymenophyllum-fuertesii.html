<p>Hymenophyllum fuertesii, commonly known as the Fuertes' filmy fern, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided leaves that are often covered in a thin, waxy layer, which helps reduce water loss. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called soruses, are embedded in the leaf margins.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum fuertesii is notable for its intricate morphology and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
