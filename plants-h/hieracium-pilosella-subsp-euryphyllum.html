<p>Hieracium pilosella subsp.</p>
<p>euryphyllum, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates.</p>
<p>The plant features basal rosettes of broadly ovate to lanceolate leaves with hairy surfaces, and its flowering stems bear yellow composite flowers. It has a taproot system and produces seeds in small, dry fruits called achenes.</p>
<p>The subspecies is characterized by its broader leaves compared to the typical H. pilosella, which contributes to its distinct botanical appearance.</p>
