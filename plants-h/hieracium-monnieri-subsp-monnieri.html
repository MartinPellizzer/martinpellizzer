<p>Hieracium monnieri subsp.</p>
<p>monnieri, commonly known as the lesser hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and flowering stems that bear yellowish to reddish composite flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and meadows, across Europe and parts of Asia. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, oval-shaped achenes as its seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its low-growing habit and ability to spread vegetatively, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
