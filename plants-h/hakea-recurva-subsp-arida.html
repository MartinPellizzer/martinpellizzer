<p>Hakea recurva subsp.</p>
<p>arida, commonly known as the arid hakea, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. It produces woody, cone-like structures that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its resilience and is often used in landscaping in semi-arid environments.</p>
