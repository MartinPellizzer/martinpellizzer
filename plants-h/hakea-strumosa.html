                    <h1>Hakea strumosa</h1>
<p>Hakea strumosa, commonly known as the red hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red, tubular flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant has needle-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its woody structure and dense foliage make it well adapted to coastal and sandy soils.</p>
<p>Hakea strumosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.</p>
