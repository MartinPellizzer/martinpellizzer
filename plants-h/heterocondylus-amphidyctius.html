                <h1>Heterocondylus amphidyctius</h1>
<p>Heterocondylus amphidyctius, commonly known as the red sand dollar, is a marine bivalve mollusk found in shallow coastal waters.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Molluscidae and is characterized by its distinctive, flattened, disc-shaped shell. The shell features a fine, granular surface with a reddish-brown coloration, which helps it blend with the sandy seabed. This species plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by contributing to sediment stabilization and serving as a food source for various marine animals.</p>
<p>Its life cycle involves a planktonic larval stage before settling onto the substrate to mature.</p>
