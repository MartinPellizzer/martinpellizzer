<p>Hippotis antioquiana, commonly known as the Antioquian bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Colombia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters and has thin, ribbon-like leaves. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged or just at the water's surface.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
