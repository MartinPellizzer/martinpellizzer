<p>Hammada articulata subsp.</p>
<p>scoparia, commonly known as the desert holly, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and North Africa. It is characterized by its compact, spiny structure and small, fleshy leaves that reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
