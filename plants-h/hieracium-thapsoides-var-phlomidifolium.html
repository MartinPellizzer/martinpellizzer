<p>Hieracium thapsoides var. phlomidifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow disk flowers surrounded by narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it can spread aggressively through rhizomes.
