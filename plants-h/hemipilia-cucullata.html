<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive hood-like bracts that encase the inflorescence. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, with a unique structure that aids in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
