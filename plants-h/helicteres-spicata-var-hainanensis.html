<p>Helicteres spicata var. hainanensis, commonly known as Hainan hollyhock, is a variant of the species native to southern China, particularly Hainan Island.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its compound leaves and showy, spiky inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, giving it its common name. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The botanical features of this variant make it a unique subject for study in plant morphology and ecological adaptation.</p>
