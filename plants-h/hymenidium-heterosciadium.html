                    <h1>Hymenidium heterosciadium</h1>
<p>Hymenidium heterosciadium, commonly known as the mountain hellebore, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a distinctive, thick, and fleshy rootstock that supports its growth in harsh mountainous environments. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are large, lobed, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Hymenidium heterosciadium is valued for its medicinal properties, though its use is limited due to its toxicity and conservation status.</p>
