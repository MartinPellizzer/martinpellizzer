                    <h1>Hemionitis ceterachoides</h1>
<p>Hemionitis ceterachoides, commonly known as the narrow-leafed hemionitis, is a rare and delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
