<p>Hedysarum volubile, commonly known as sweet vetch, is a climbing legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features trifoliate leaves with tendrils that help it攀援 on supports. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in racemes, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Hedysarum volubile is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and ornamental appeal.</p>
