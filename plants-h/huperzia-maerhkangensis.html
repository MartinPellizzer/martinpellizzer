                    <h1>Huperzia maerhkangensis</h1>
<p>Huperzia maerhkangensis, commonly known as the Maerhkang clubmoss, is a rare and lesser-known species of the Huperzia genus.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial, evergreen plant characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, scale-like leaves. Native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces sporangia on specialized structures called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of its stems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Huperzia maerhkangensis is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
