<p>Hoepfneria africana, commonly known as the African waterwheel, is a perennial aquatic plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette at the water's surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Hoepfneria africana thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
