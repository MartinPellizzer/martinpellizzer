<p>Hypericum alpestre var. giganteum, commonly known as the Alpine St. John's Wort, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features upright, branching stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, covered in dense, yellow-orange flowers during the summer months. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine climates.</p>
