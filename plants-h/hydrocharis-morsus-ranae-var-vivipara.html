                    <h1>Hydrocharis morsus-ranae var. vivipara</h1>
<p>Hydrocharis morsus-ranae var. vivipara, commonly known as the aquatic frog lily or the water frog lily, is a variant of the water shield plant.</p>
<p>It is a floating aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia, typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. One of its notable botanical features is its viviparous reproduction, where the seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant.</p>
<p>This adaptation allows it to spread efficiently in aquatic environments.</p>
