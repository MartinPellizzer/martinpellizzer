                    <h1>Habenaria obsoleta</h1>
<p>Habenaria obsoleta, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green, leaf-like appearance and its delicate, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows on the bark of trees in moist, shaded environments, often in wetlands or swamps. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
