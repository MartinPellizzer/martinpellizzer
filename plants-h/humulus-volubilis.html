                    <h1>Humulus volubilis</h1>
<p>Humulus volubilis, commonly known as hops, is a climbing herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vigorous growth habit, with long, flexible stems that twine around supports. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-yellow flowers that develop into cone-like structures called strobiles. These cones are the primary part used in brewing beer, containing compounds that contribute to flavor, aroma, and preservation.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the Cannabaceae family and is closely related to hemp and other Cannabis species.</p>
