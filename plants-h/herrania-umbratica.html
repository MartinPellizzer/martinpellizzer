<p>Herrania umbratica, commonly known as the shade vine, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its climbing habit and heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas.</p>
