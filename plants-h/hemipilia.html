                    <h1>Hemipilia</h1>
<p>Hemipilia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, exhibiting an epiphytic growth habit. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, and it produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Hemipilia is considered a conservation concern in many regions.</p>
