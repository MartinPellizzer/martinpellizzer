<p>Helleborus viridis var. cupreus is a rare and striking plant known for its unique foliage and subtle blooms. Native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, it thrives in cool, shaded environments with well-drained soil. Its leaves are a vibrant green, often edged with a coppery hue that adds to its visual appeal. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that contrast beautifully with its foliage.
