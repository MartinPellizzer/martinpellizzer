<p>Hartia sichuanensis, commonly known as the Sichuan hartia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 2,000 meters. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Hartia sichuanensis is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
