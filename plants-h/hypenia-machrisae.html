<p>Hypenia machrisae, commonly known as the desert holly, is a shrub native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, blue-green leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Hypenia machrisae is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and hardy nature.</p>
