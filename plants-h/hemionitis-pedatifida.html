                    <h1>Hemionitis pedatifida</h1>
<p>Hemionitis pedatifida, commonly known as the broadleaf spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, fleshy, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Hemionitis pedatifida is also known for its ability to accumulate toxic compounds, which deter herbivores and contribute to its ecological resilience.</p>
