                    <h1>Hymenophyllum macrocarpum</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum macrocarpum, commonly known as the giant toothed moss, is a fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in dense, stalked groups on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an important species in ecological studies of epiphytic flora.</p>
