                    <h1>Heliamphora tatei var. macdonaldae</h1>
<p>Heliamphora tatei var. macdonaldae, commonly known as the Macdonald's sun pitcher, is a carnivorous plant native to the tepuis of Venezuela.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, tubular pitchers that secrete a sticky liquid to trap insects. The plant thrives in high-altitude, nutrient-poor environments, relying on its specialized morphology for survival. Its leaves form a rosette, and the pitchers are often covered in fine hairs that aid in trapping prey.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its striking appearance and ecological adaptation to its unique habitat.</p>
