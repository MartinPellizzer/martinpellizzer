<p>Hyphaene taprobanica, commonly known as the coconut palm, is a tall, slender tree native to the coastal regions of the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pinnate leaves and a single, unbranched trunk that grows from a fibrous root system. The plant produces large, fibrous fruits that contain a single seed surrounded by a white, fleshy mesocarp. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility.</p>
<p>The plant plays a crucial role in coastal ecosystems and is widely cultivated for its economic and ecological value.</p>
