<p>Hornungia alpina subsp.</p>
<p>alpina, commonly known as the alpine hornungia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically forms dense cushions or mats, which help it survive in harsh alpine environments.</p>
<p>The plant has small, needle-like leaves that are covered in a thick layer of fine hairs, providing protection against cold and desiccation. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, appearing in late summer, and are clustered in short inflorescences.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to rocky and gravelly soils, often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes.</p>
