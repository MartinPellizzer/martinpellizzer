                    <h1>Hydnophytum spathulatum</h1>
<p>Hydnophytum spathulatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is native to tropical regions of Asia, Africa, and Australia. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it photosynthesizes to some extent. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are often overlooked, but they produce fleshy, berry-like fruits that attract birds for seed dispersal.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and providing food for wildlife.</p>
