                    <h1>Hydnophytum dolichophyllum</h1>
<p>Hydnophytum dolichophyllum, commonly known as the long-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Viscaraceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in tropical rainforests, often growing on the branches of trees such as dipterocarps. The plant has a unique structure with a short stem and elongated, fleshy leaves that are adapted for photosynthesis while also absorbing water and nutrients from its host. Its small, white or yellowish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and specific habitat requirements, it plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
