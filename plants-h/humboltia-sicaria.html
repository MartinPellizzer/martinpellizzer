                    <h1>Humboltia sicaria</h1>
<p>Humboltia sicaria, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub characterized by its woody stems and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has adapted to harsh desert conditions with thick, fleshy leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Humboltia sicaria plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small animals.</p>
