                    <h1>Halogeton articulatus</h1>
<p>Halogeton articulatus, commonly known as the saltbush, is a halophyte plant adapted to thrive in saline and arid environments.</p>
<p>It has succulent, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, green to yellowish flowers, typically in clusters, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its leaves are reduced to small scales, minimizing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Halogeton articulatus is often found in desert regions and is used in some areas for forage or soil stabilization.</p>
