                    <h1>Hemionitis griffithii var. pinnatifida</h1>
<p>Hemionitis griffithii var. pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hemionitis, is a rare and specialized fern species native to the arid regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnatifid (bipinnate) fronds that are adapted to thrive in dry, rocky habitats. The plant has a unique growth form, with creeping rhizomes and small, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery trichomes. It is primarily found in high-altitude environments, where it forms dense mats on rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
