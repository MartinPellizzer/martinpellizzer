                            <h1>Hieracium Sagittatum Subsp. Molybdinum</h1>
<p>Hieracium sagittatum subsp. molybdinum is a lesser-known member of the dandelion family known for its unique leaf shape and striking yellow flowers. This subspecies is often found in moist, calcareous soils across northern Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges, where it can receive ample sunlight. The plant's name refers to its arrowhead-shaped leaves and its association with metallic minerals. Despite its modest appearance, it plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance.</p>
