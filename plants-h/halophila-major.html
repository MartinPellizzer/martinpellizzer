                    <h1>Halophila major</h1>
<p>Halophila major, commonly known as the seagrass species found in coastal regions, is a marine flowering plant belonging to the Alismataceae family.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, warm, tropical waters and is often found in sandy or muddy substrates. The plant has long, ribbon-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water resistance in aquatic environments. Halophila major plays a crucial role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for various marine organisms.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important component of seagrass meadows in coastal ecosystems.</p>
