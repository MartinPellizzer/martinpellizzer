<p>Heracleum sphondylium subsp.</p>
<p>montanum, commonly known as mountain hogweed, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, umbrella-shaped compound leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers.</p>
<p>The plant contains phototoxic compounds in its sap, which can cause severe skin irritation upon exposure to sunlight. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions.</p>
