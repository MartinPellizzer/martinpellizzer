                    <h1>Halostachys nodulosa</h1>
<p>Halostachys nodulosa, commonly known as the nodular sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Halostachys nodulosa plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
