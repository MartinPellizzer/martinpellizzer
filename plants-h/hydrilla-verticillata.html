                    <h1>Hydrilla verticillata</h1>
<p>Hydrilla verticillata, commonly known as waterweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has long, flexible stems that branch at the nodes, forming dense clusters of whorled leaves. The leaves are typically narrow and ribbon-like, with a smooth surface and a pointed tip. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, followed by dark, spherical fruits.</p>
<p>Hydrilla is highly invasive and can rapidly colonize water bodies, impacting aquatic ecosystems and water quality.</p>
