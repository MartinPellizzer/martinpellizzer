<p>Hedysarum mackenziei var. canescens, commonly known as the Mackenzie's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, ascending stems with small, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, followed by elongated pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is characterized by its pale, bluish-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
