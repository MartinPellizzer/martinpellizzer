                    <h1>Heterotaenia bourgaei</h1>
<p>Heterotaenia bourgaei, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant yellow petals and a distinctive star-shaped pattern on its lip, which is a key feature in its classification. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Heterotaenia bourgaei is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
