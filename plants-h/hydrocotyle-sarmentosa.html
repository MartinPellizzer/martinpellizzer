<p>Hydrocotyle sarmentosa, commonly known as the creeping marshweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats.</p>
<p>It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in diameter. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. Its stems are often prostrate, allowing it to spread across the surface of wet soils.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle sarmentosa is adapted to moist environments and plays a role in stabilizing aquatic and riparian ecosystems.</p>
