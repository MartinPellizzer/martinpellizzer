                    <h1>Haplophyllum leiocarpum</h1>
<p>Haplophyllum leiocarpum, commonly known as the white-fruit cycad, is a unique cycad species native to eastern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, round, white to yellowish fruits that mature over several months. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, a common trait among cycads.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
