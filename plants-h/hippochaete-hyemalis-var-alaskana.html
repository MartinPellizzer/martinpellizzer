<p>Hippochaete hyemalis var. alaskana, commonly known as the Alaska winter dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh, cold climates. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments.</p>
<p>The flowers produce small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in the plant's survival in its extreme habitat.</p>
