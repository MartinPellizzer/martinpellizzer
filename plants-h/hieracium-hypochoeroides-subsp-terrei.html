<p>Hieracium hypochoeroides subsp.</p>
<p>terrei, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosettes of leaves, which help it survive in cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in several European countries.</p>
