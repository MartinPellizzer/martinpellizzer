                    <h1>Hoya lii</h1>
<p>Hoya lii, commonly known as the "Hoya of the Philippines," is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features waxy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a slight sheen. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Hoya lii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for hanging baskets or as a tabletop plant.</p>
