<p>Herniaria glabra var. genuina, commonly known as the smooth bladderwort, is a small, mat-forming plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Halocarpaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, green, bladder-like structures called pseudostems. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, moist environments such as tundra and rocky soils. Its leaves are simple and often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to cold climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments.</p>
