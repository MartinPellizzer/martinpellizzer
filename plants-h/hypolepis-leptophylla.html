                    <h1>Hypolepis leptophylla</h1>
<p>Hypolepis leptophylla, commonly known as the slender-leaf huperzia, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Huperziaceae and is characterized by its delicate, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and habitat make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
