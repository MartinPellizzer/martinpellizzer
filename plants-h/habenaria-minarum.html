                    <h1>Habenaria minarum</h1>
<p>Habenaria minarum, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forest understories and mountainous regions. The plant features a slender, upright stem with a single or few flowers that are usually white or pale pink in color. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The orchid's morphology reflects its adaptation to low-light environments, with broad, leathery leaves that help retain moisture.</p>
