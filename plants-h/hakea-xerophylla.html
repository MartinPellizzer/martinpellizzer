                    <h1>Hakea xerophylla</h1>
<p>Hakea xerophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems and narrow, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces cylindrical, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Hakea xerophylla is well-suited to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland heathlands.</p>
<p>Its structure and adaptations make it a typical example of a xerophyte, thriving in arid environments.</p>
