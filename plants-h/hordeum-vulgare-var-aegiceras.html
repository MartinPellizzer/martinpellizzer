                    <h1>Hordeum vulgare var. aegiceras</h1>
<p>Hordeum vulgare var. aegiceras, commonly known as the sea barley, is a variant of barley adapted to coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its salt-tolerant properties, making it suitable for growth in saline soils and maritime climates. The plant typically exhibits a compact growth habit with shorter stems and reduced leaf size compared to common barley. Its seeds are small and hardy, often used in traditional agriculture or as a forage crop in coastal regions.</p>
<p>This variety plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and preventing erosion due to its robust root system.</p>
