                    <h1>Heteroderis pusilla var. chaetocephala</h1>
<p>Heteroderis pusilla var. chaetocephala, commonly known as the small root knot nematode, is a species of plant-parasitic nematode belonging to the family Heteroderidae.</p>
<p>It primarily infects the roots of a wide range of host plants, causing galls or knots to form as a result of its feeding activities. The nematode's life cycle involves several stages, including egg, four juvenile stages, and an adult stage, with the second-stage juveniles being the infective stage. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in soil with high organic matter content.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to cause significant damage to crops, it is a major concern in agricultural pest management.</p>
