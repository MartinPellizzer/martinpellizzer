                    <h1>Helianthemon polyanthum</h1>
<p>Helianthemon polyanthum, commonly known as the yellow mangrove, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fibrous root system that helps stabilize shorelines and prevent erosion. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically opposite and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss in saline environments.</p>
<p>Helianthemon polyanthum plays an important ecological role in mangrove ecosystems by providing habitat and supporting biodiversity.</p>
