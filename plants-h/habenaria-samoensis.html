                    <h1>Habenaria samoensis</h1>
<p>Habenaria samoensis, commonly known as the Samoan butterfly orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the islands of Samoa and nearby regions in the South Pacific.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, butterfly-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas, where it thrives on the nutrients of decaying organic matter. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the soil, while its leaves are narrow and grass-like.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
