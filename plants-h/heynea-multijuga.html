<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray-brown bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers followed by elliptical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood used in furniture and construction.</p>
