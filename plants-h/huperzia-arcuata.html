                    <h1>Huperzia arcuata</h1>
<p>Huperzia arcuata, commonly known as the curl-leaf clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its distinctive, arching leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically forms dense mats on rocky or shaded forest floors, often in temperate regions. Its sporophytes produce spores in cup-like structures called sporangia, which are clustered in strobili.</p>
<p>Huperzia arcuata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
