                    <h1>Haplochorema decus-silvae</h1>
<p>Haplochorema decus-silvae, commonly known as the silvan ornament, is a rare and striking plant native to the dense forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spiraling inflorescence that resembles decorative patterns, giving it its common name. The plant belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is known for its small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in complex arrangements. Its leaves are alternate and lanceolate, often with a waxy coating that aids in moisture retention.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
