                    <h1>Hydrocotyle polyrhiza</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle polyrhiza, commonly known as water pennywort, is a floating aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and Australia.</p>
<p>It has small, rounded leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in diameter, with a waxy surface that helps it float on water. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often submerged or just at the water's surface. It is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle polyrhiza is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
