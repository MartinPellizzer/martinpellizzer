                    <h1>Hyoscyamus agrestis var. sinuatus</h1>
<p>Hyoscyamus agrestis var. sinuatus, commonly known as the sinuous thornapple, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its spiny stems and lobed, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers that give way to spherical, spiny fruits containing toxic seeds. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a weed in agricultural areas and requires caution when handling.</p>
