                    <h1>Heracleum likiangense</h1>
<p>Heracleum likiangense, commonly known as the Yunnan cowparade, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, compound leaves.</p>
<p>It is native to China, particularly in Yunnan province, and thrives in moist, temperate environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family. Its foliage is often used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
<p>However, it contains phototoxic compounds, making it potentially harmful if handled without protection.</p>
