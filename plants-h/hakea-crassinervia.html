                    <h1>Hakea crassinervia</h1>
<p>Hakea crassinervia, commonly known as the broad-veined hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Its woody structure and specialized leaf anatomy make it well-suited to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Hakea crassinervia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to local wildlife.</p>
