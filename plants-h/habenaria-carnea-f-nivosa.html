                    <h1>Habenaria carnea f. nivosa</h1>
<p>Habenaria carnea f. nivosa, commonly known as the Snowy Habenaria, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers, which are often covered in a fine, silky texture that gives it a frost-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and the plant produces a single, elongated inflorescence bearing several flowers.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a delicate and endangered species.</p>
