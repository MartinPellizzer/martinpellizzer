                    <h1>Helianthemum glaucum var. stoechadifolium</h1>
<p>Helianthemum glaucum var. stoechadifolium, commonly known as the coastal helianthemum, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of Scotland and northern England.</p>
<p>It features dense, silver-green foliage with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery bloom. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is highly tolerant of coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
