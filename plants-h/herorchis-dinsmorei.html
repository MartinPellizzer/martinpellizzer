<p>Herorchis dinsmorei, commonly known as the Dinsmore's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant grows in moist, shaded habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands, often in association with specific host plants. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which is essential for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
