<p>Hieracium megapalentinum, commonly known as the giant hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant features a robust, upright stem that can grow up to 1 meter in height, supporting large, lobed leaves with a rough texture. Its showy yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
