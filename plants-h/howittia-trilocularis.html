                    <h1>Howittia trilocularis</h1>
<p>Howittia trilocularis, commonly known as the three-chambered bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in wet, nutrient-poor environments such as swamps and marshes. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its flowering stems rise above the water surface.</p>
<p>Howittia trilocularis plays an important ecological role in its habitat by controlling insect populations and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
