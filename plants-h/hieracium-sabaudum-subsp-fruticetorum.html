<p>Hieracium sabaudum subsp.</p>
<p>fruticetorum, commonly known as the shrubby hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are broadly ovate with a hairy surface, and it produces yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its flowering stems are usually shorter than the leaves, and the flowers are surrounded by a series of leaf-like bracts.</p>
<p>This subspecies is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often mistaken for other hawkweed species due to its similar appearance.</p>
