                    <h1>Halimium argenteum</h1>
<p>Halimium argenteum, commonly known as silver germander, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Halimium argenteum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators.</p>
