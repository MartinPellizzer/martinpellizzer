                    <h1>Herreria coriacea</h1>
<p>Herreria coriacea, commonly known as the rough herreria, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are covered in a rough, textured bark, which provides structural support and protection against herbivores.</p>
<p>Herreria coriacea is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
