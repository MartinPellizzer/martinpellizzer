<p>Heloniopsis orientalis var. purpurea, commonly known as the purple spiral grass, is a striking ornamental plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiral-like arrangement of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a compact, mound-shaped growth habit. The plant produces small, fluffy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its unique foliage and seasonal blooms make it a valuable addition to both garden landscapes and botanical collections.</p>
