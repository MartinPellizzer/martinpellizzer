<p>Hieracium piloselloides subsp.</p>
<p>megalomastix, commonly known as the giant meadow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its erect stems and basal rosettes of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which attract various pollinators. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain habitats.</p>
