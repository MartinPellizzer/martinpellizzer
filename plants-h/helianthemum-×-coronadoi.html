<p>Helianthemum × coronadoi, commonly known as Coronado's rockrose, is a hybrid shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscaping projects in dry climates.</p>
