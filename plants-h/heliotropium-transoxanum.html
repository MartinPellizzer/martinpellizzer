<p>Heliotropium transoxanum, commonly known as the Transoxiana heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showing adaptations to drought conditions. Its flowers are usually purple or pink, and they open in response to sunlight, a trait known as heliotropism.</p>
<p>It is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its botanical significance is more ecological than medicinal.</p>
