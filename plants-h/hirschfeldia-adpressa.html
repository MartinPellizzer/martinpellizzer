                    <h1>Hirschfeldia adpressa</h1>
<p>Hirschfeldia adpressa, commonly known as the flat sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It has small, pale green, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well adapted to sandy and rocky soils.</p>
<p>Hirschfeldia adpressa is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, where it plays a minor but ecologically significant role.</p>
