<p>Hyphaene multiformis subsp.</p>
<p>compressa, commonly known as the African fan palm, is a distinctive palm species native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of fan-shaped leaves that give it a unique appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with both male and female flowers, typical of many palm species. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional practices in its native regions.</p>
