                    <h1>Heterocondylus penninervius</h1>
<p>Heterocondylus penninervius, commonly known as the narrow-veined fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds with a distinctive arrangement of veins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
