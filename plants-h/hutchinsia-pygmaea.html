<p>Hutchinsia pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf hutchinsia, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its rugged appearance. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate periods of drought.</p>
<p>Due to its unique characteristics, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes.</p>
