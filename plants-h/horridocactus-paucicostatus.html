<p>Horridocactus paucicostatus, commonly known as the spiny barrel cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stem that is covered in sharp, spiny tubercles, which provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged structure.
