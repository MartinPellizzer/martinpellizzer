                    <h1>Hymenophyllum pedicellatum</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum pedicellatum, commonly known as the lace fern, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of hair-like structures. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually bright green and have a leathery texture, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a thin, membranous cover.</p>
