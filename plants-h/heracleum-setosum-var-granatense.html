<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into spherical, dry fruits known as schizocarps. It is notable for its finely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a rough, textured appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and naturalized areas.</p>
