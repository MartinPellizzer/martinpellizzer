                    <h1>Hoffmannseggella liliputana</h1>
<p>Hoffmannseggella liliputana, commonly known as the dwarf dandelion, is a small flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and is characterized by its delicate, yellow composite flowers and basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that allow it to colonize new areas easily.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and widespread distribution, it is often overlooked but plays a role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
