                    <h1>Heterochiton fruticosa</h1>
<p>Heterochiton fruticosa, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, succulent stems and small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers, which bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to thrive in harsh conditions with minimal rainfall and high sunlight exposure.</p>
<p>Heterochiton fruticosa is often found in coastal and inland desert regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
