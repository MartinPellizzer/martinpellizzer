                    <h1>Haplocoelum</h1>
<p>Haplocoelum, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a genus of aquatic ferns belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their delicate, translucent fronds that often appear as ghostly shapes on submerged rocks. They typically grow in shaded, humid environments, such as stream beds and forest floors. Haplocoelum species are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on other plants or rocks rather than in soil.</p>
<p>Their unique morphology and habitat preferences make them an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
