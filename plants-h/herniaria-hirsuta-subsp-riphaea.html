<p>Herniaria hirsuta subsp.</p>
<p>riphaea, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in sandy and gravelly soils. It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves and clusters of tiny white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to harsh environments, often found in coastal dunes and arid regions. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against strong winds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
