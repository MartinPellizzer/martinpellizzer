                    <h1>Haloschoenus capillaris</h1>
<p>Haloschoenus capillaris, commonly known as the slender saltgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, often found in dune environments and along the edges of salt lakes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sandy soils, making it an important pioneer species in coastal restoration.</p>
<p>Haloschoenus capillaris plays a crucial role in preventing erosion and supporting local biodiversity in its habitat.</p>
