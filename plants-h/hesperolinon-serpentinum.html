                    <h1>Hesperolinon serpentinum</h1>
<p>Hesperolinon serpentinum, commonly known as the serpentine hesperolinon, is a rare and unique plant species adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, magnesium-rich soils found in serpentine habitats.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic and edible plants, though this species is not typically consumed by humans. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, delicate white or pale yellow flowers. It is often found in rocky or gravelly areas, thriving in environments with low soil fertility and high levels of heavy metals.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of serpentine soil conditions.</p>
