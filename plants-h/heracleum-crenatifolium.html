                    <h1>Heracleum crenatifolium</h1>
<p>Heracleum crenatifolium, commonly known as the rough cowparsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage.</p>
<p>It is a biennial or perennial herb that can grow up to 2 meters tall, with large, serrated leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small white or greenish flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, which are followed by brown, dry fruits. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, disturbed habitats such as meadows and riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its tall stature and distinctive appearance, it is often mistaken for other members of the carrot family.</p>
