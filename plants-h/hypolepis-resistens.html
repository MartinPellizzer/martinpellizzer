                    <h1>Hypolepis resistens</h1>
<p>Hypolepis resistens, commonly known as the hardy water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into smaller segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water bodies such as streams and swamps. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to wet soil or submerged substrates.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
