                    <h1>Hydrophyllum capitatum var. pumilum</h1>
<p>Hydrophyllum capitatum var. pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf blueweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and rocky slopes. The plant has small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is smaller than the typical Hydrophyllum capitatum, with a more compact growth habit.</p>
