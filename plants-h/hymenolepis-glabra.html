<p>Hymenolepis glabra, commonly known as the smooth liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid body composed of a flattened, ribbon-like structure called a thallus. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having specialized structures for absorption and reproduction.</p>
<p>Hymenolepis glabra reproduces both sexually through spores and asexually through gemmae, which are small, vegetative propagules.</p>
