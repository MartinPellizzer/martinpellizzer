                    <h1>Horridocactus paucicostatus var. viridis</h1>
<p>Horridocactus paucicostatus var. viridis, commonly known as the green spineless cactus, is a unique cacti species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and prominent, green spines that provide both protection and a striking visual appearance. The plant thrives in arid environments, requiring minimal water and well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is typically a vibrant green, which helps it photosynthesize efficiently in low-nutrient conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its resilience and ornamental value in xeriscaping and desert gardens.</p>
