<p>Hymenolepis validinervis, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small organisms. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are usually reduced to scale-like structures, and it reproduces through the production of motile zoospores.</p>
<p>Hymenolepis validinervis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microscopic life.</p>
