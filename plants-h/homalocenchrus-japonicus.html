                    <h1>Homalocenchrus japonicus</h1>
<p>Homalocenchrus japonicus, commonly known as the Japanese sand rat, is a species of grass that thrives in sandy and coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted structure with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to arid conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitats.</p>
