                    <h1>Hammatolobium</h1>
<p>Hammatolobium, commonly known as the desert star or desert flax, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, often spiny stems and showy, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow, orange, or red. The plants are adapted to hot, dry environments, with deep root systems that allow them to survive in poor soil conditions. Hammatolobium species are often found in rocky habitats and are important for local pollinators.</p>
<p>Their botanical features make them well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects in desert landscapes.</p>
