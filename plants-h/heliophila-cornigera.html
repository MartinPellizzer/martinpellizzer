<p>Heliophila cornigera, commonly known as the marsh woundwort, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its flowers bloom in clusters at the top of the stems.</p>
<p>Heliophila cornigera is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
