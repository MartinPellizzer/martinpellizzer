                    <h1>Hemionitis plantaginea</h1>
<p>Hemionitis plantaginea, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white spore-bearing structures called sorus on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is often studied for its role in desert ecosystems.</p>
