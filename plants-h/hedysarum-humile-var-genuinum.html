                    <h1>Hedysarum humile var. genuinum</h1>
<p>Hedysarum humile var. genuinum, commonly known as the small trefoil, is a low-growing perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features trifoliate leaves with three small, rounded leaflets and produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in loose clusters. The plant is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and its ability to thrive in well-drained, alkaline soils. It is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and nitrogen-fixing capabilities.</p>
<p>This variety is distinct from other Hedysarum species due to its compact growth habit and specific geographic distribution.</p>
