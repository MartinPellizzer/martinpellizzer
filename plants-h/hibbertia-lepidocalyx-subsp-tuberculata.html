<p>Hibbertia lepidocalyx subsp.</p>
<p>tuberculata, commonly known as the woolly golden bush, is a shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring.</p>
<p>The plant has small, elliptical leaves covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its flowers are typically arranged in clusters and are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and birds.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to rocky soils and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands.</p>
