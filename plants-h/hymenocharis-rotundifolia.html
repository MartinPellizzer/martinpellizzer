                    <h1>Hymenocharis rotundifolia</h1>
<p>Hymenocharis rotundifolia, commonly known as the red-eyed cycad, is a striking member of the Zamiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its distinctive, palm-like leaves that are often tinged with red at the base. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are typically borne on the trunk. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, though it requires specific care to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild.</p>
