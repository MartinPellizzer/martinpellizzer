                    <h1>Hottonia sessiliflora</h1>
<p>Hottonia sessiliflora, commonly known as the water crown, is a aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense, floating mat on the water surface. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in shallow water environments.</p>
<p>H. sessiliflora is often found in ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
