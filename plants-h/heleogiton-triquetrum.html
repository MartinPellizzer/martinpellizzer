                    <h1>Heleogiton triquetrum</h1>
<p>Heleogiton triquetrum, commonly known as the three-angled bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest aquatic insects. The plant has a slender, branching stem with whorled leaves that are typically three-angled in cross-section. It thrives in still or slow-moving water, often in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>Its unique trapping mechanism allows it to supplement its nutrient intake in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
