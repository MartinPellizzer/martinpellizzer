                    <h1>Hosackia</h1>
<p>Hosackia, commonly known as the prairie clover, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to North America and are typically found in prairie and open woodland habitats. Hosackia species are characterized by their showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from yellow to reddish-brown. They have trifoliate leaves and are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Hosackia missouriensis and Hosackia stipulata, which vary in growth habits and flower morphology.</p>
