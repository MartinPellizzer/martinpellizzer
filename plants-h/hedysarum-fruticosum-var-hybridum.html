                    <h1>Hedysarum fruticosum var. hybridum</h1>
<p>Hedysarum fruticosum var. hybridum, commonly known as the hybrid broomrape, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its lack of true leaves, relying instead on chlorophyll-containing stems for photosynthesis. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in racemes, and it has a fibrous root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it can photosynthesize but also derives some nutrients from its host plants.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat.</p>
