<p>Heisteria nitida, commonly known as the velvetleaf heister, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, velvety pubescence, giving it a soft, textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Heisteria nitida is often found in woodland edges and disturbed sites, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun.</p>
