<p>Homalospermum firmum, commonly known as the desert holly, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months. Its root system is extensive, enabling it to access water deep underground.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to remain dormant during droughts is a key adaptation to its harsh habitat.</p>
