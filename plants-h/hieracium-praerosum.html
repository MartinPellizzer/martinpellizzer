<p>Hieracium praerosum, commonly known as the early hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by seed heads that disperse easily.</p>
<p>Hieracium praerosum is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators and maintaining soil stability.</p>
