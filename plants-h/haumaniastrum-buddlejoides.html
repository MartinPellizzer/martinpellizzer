<p>Haumaniastrum buddlejoides, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the milkweed family, Apocynaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant has opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Its flowers are typically tubular and produce nectar, making it an important food source for pollinators such as butterflies and bees.</p>
