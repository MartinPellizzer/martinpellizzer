                    <h1>Heterostemon impar</h1>
<p>Heterostemon impar, commonly known as the irregular stamen plant, is a unique species characterized by its distinct floral structure.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lamiaceae and is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves and produces showy, bilaterally symmetric flowers with two distinct types of stamens. Its botanical interest lies in its unusual floral morphology, which includes both long and short stamens.</p>
<p>This characteristic makes it a subject of study in plant morphology and evolutionary botany.</p>
