                    <h1>Hieracium laevigatum var. coronopifolioides</h1>
<p>Hieracium laevigatum var. coronopifolioides, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of broadly ovate to lanceolate leaves that are generally smooth or slightly hairy. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
