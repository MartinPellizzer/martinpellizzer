                    <h1>Hydrocotyle rotundifolia var. pauciflora</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle rotundifolia var. pauciflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh mallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It features rounded, palmate leaves that are typically smaller than those of the typical variety, with a smooth, waxy texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
