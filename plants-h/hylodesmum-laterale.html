                    <h1>Hylodesmum laterale</h1>
<p>Hylodesmum laterale, commonly known as the silver hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage, which is covered in minute, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant typically forms dense mats on moist, shaded soils in woodland areas. Its reproductive structures consist of small, club-shaped spikes that bear spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Hylodesmum laterale is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for microorganisms.</p>
