                    <h1>Hymenachne indica</h1>
<p>Hymenachne indica, commonly known as the Indian flat sedge, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats.</p>
<p>Hymenachne indica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
