<p>Hyperthelia cornucopiae, commonly known as the horned bellflower, is a unique flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. The plant produces a distinctive horn-like structure at the base of its stem, which is thought to play a role in seed dispersal. Hyperthelia cornucopiae thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a fascinating subject for study in both horticulture and evolutionary botany.</p>
