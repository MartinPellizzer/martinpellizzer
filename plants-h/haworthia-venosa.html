                    <h1>Haworthia venosa</h1>
<p>Haworthia venosa, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense rosettes of thick, fleshy leaves with distinctive white or yellow markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The leaves are typically a dark green color and have a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, white, star-shaped flowers on tall, slender stems during the warmer months.</p>
<p>This plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light.</p>
