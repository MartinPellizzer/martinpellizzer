<p>Hydnophytum macrophyllum, commonly known as the giant hydnophytum, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad leaves and unique ability to form symbiotic relationships with specific fungi. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its roots can develop into specialized structures called mycorrhizae, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Hydnophytum macrophyllum is also notable for its ability to trap and digest insects, contributing to its ecological role in nutrient cycling.</p>
