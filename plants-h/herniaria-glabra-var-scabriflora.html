                    <h1>Herniaria glabra var. scabriflora</h1>
<p>Herniaria glabra var. scabriflora, commonly known as the rough-flowered bladderwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and coastal areas.</p>
<p>It features small, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces tiny white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the summer months. It is adapted to harsh environments, with a shallow root system that helps it thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its slightly rough foliage compared to the smooth leaves of the typical Herniaria glabra.</p>
