                    <h1>Heptallon simplex</h1>
<p>Heptallon simplex, commonly known as the slender heather, is a low-growing shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for gardeners in Mediterranean climates.</p>
