                    <h1>Hydrocotyle colorata</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle colorata, commonly known as the silverleaf marsh plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of broad, silver-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers clustered in umbels, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in shallow water or moist soil.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle colorata is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along slow-moving streams.</p>
