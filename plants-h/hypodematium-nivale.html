                    <h1>Hypodematium nivale</h1>
<p>Hypodematium nivale, commonly known as the snow lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in cold, temperate climates.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale gray to white thallus, which is often covered in a fine, powdery layer. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship with a green alga and a fungus, contributing to its ability to survive in harsh environments. It is typically found on tree trunks, rocks, and soil in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for air quality and ecological health.</p>
