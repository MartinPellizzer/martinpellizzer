                    <h1>Heteropogon allionii var. secundus</h1>
<p>Heteropogon allionii var. secundus, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with silver or gray. The plant produces small, pale green to brown flowers in dense clusters, typically during the late spring and early summer. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its low-growing habit and drought tolerance, it is often found in Mediterranean climates.</p>
