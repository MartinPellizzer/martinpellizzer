                    <h1>Huperzia selago var. miyoshiana</h1>
<p>Huperzia selago var. miyoshiana, commonly known as the Japanese clubmoss, is a rare variant of the clubmoss genus Huperzia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing evergreen plant characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. Native to Japan, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant produces sporangia on specialized structures called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of its branches.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
