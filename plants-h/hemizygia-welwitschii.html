<p>Hemizygia welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitschia tree, is a unique succulent plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia and Angola.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its two large, leathery leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant has a thick, woody trunk that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>Hemizygia welwitschii is considered a living fossil due to its ancient lineage and distinctive morphology.</p>
