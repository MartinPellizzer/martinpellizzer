                    <h1>Heteromorpha papillosa</h1>
<p>Heteromorpha papillosa, commonly known as the pink ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with pale pink or white petals and a distinctive, elongated spur. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, adding a rare beauty to the forest canopy.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
