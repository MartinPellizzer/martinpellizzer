                    <h1>Haloragis heterophylla var. pinnatifida</h1>
<p>Haloragis heterophylla var. pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved waterwheel, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, opposite, pinnately divided leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and wetlands. It produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in whorls along the stems, and it is often used in ornamental water gardens.</p>
<p>Haloragis heterophylla var. pinnatifida is valued for its ability to provide habitat for aquatic invertebrates and its aesthetic appeal in aquatic landscapes.</p>
