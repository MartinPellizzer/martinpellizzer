                    <h1>Halocnemum caspicum</h1>
<p>Halocnemum caspicum, commonly known as the Caspian sea blite, is a halophytic plant adapted to thrive in saline environments.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Caspian Sea basin, including parts of Russia, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan. The plant has small, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. It produces yellow flowers and is often found growing in coastal dunes or salt marshes.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate high salt concentrations makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
