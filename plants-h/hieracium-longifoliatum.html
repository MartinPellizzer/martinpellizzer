<p>Hieracium longifoliatum, commonly known as the long-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in the summer months. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It has rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The plant is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habit and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
