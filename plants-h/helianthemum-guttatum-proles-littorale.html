                    <h1>Helianthemum guttatum proles littorale</h1>
<p>Helianthemum guttatum proles littorale, commonly known as the coastal dwarf sunflower, is a low-growing shrub native to coastal regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent leaves that are covered in a waxy coating, helping it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and rocky coastlines.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and salt tolerance make it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems.</p>
