                    <h1>Hydrocotyle modesta</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle modesta, commonly known as the small-leaved water shield, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and aquatic environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, with its rhizomes anchoring it in the substrate. The plant features heart-shaped, floating leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. Its small, white flowers bloom in clusters, and the plant produces small, berry-like fruits that disperse through water.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle modesta plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms.</p>
