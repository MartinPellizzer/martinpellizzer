<p>Hieracium saxifragum subsp.</p>
<p>hemipolium, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils at high altitudes. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity, it is often found in remote, high-altitude environments where competition from other plants is minimal.</p>
