<p>Hieracium glaciale subsp.</p>
<p>subglaciale, commonly known as the glacier hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in harsh, cold environments, often found in rocky or snow-covered areas. It has adapted to high-altitude conditions through its compact growth form and frost-resistant properties.</p>
<p>Its subspecies status reflects its distinct ecological and morphological traits compared to other Hieracium species.</p>
