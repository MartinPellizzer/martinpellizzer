<p>Herniaria caucasica, commonly known as Caucasian sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Caucasus region.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, sandy, or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or arid environments. Its compact growth habit and ability to survive in harsh conditions make it well-adapted to its native habitat.</p>
<p>Herniaria caucasica is also noted for its medicinal properties, though its use is less common compared to other members of its genus.</p>
