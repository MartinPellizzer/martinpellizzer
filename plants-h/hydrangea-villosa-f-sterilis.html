                    <h1>Hydrangea villosa f. sterilis</h1>
<p>Hydrangea villosa f. sterilis, commonly known as the sterile form of the hairy hydrangea, is a botanical variant characterized by its reduced flowering capability.</p>
<p>This cultivar typically exhibits dense, dark green foliage with a velvety texture due to its hairy stems and leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. The plant's ornamental value lies primarily in its foliage rather than its flowers.</p>
<p>It is often used in horticultural settings for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments.</p>
