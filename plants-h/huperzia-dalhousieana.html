<p>Huperzia dalhousieana, commonly known as the Dalhousie clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, creeping growth habit and its ability to form extensive mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces sporophylls that are clustered in cone-like structures, which contain the spores for reproduction. It is typically found in temperate regions, often in shaded, moist environments.</p>
<p>Huperzia dalhousieana plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
