<p>Hedysarum algidum, commonly known as the alpine vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Hedysarum algidum thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native environments.</p>
