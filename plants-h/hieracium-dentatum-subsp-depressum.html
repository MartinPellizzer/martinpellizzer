<p>Hieracium dentatum subsp.</p>
<p>depressum, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are typically lance-shaped with serrated edges. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
