                    <h1>Hieracium longipilum f. eglandulosum</h1>
<p>Hieracium longipilum f. eglandulosum, commonly known as the glandless hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Compositae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and bright yellow composite flowers. The plant is typically found in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It produces small, achene-like seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by the absence of glandular structures on its leaves, a key feature that sets it apart from other forms of Hieracium.</p>
