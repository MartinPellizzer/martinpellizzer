<p>Hieracium pseudopaltinae subsp.</p>
<p>stenobracteophorum, commonly known as the narrow-bract hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a flowering stem that bears yellow flowers in a single head.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its narrow bracts and relatively small flower heads compared to other Hieracium species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native habitat.</p>
