                    <h1>Hoffmannseggia melanosticta var. greggii</h1>
<p>Hoffmannseggia melanosticta var. greggii, commonly known as Gregg's desert-holly, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure is adapted to minimize water loss, with reduced leaf surfaces and a compact growth form.</p>
