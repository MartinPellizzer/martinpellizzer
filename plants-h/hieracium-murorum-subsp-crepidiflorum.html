<p>Hieracium murorum subsp.</p>
<p>crepidiflorum, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, often forming dense mats.</p>
<p>The plant features basal leaves that are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, while its flowering stems bear yellow composite flowers. It produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
