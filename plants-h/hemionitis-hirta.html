                    <h1>Hemionitis hirta</h1>
<p>Hemionitis hirta, commonly known as the hairy hemionitis, is a rare and specialized fern native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely hairy fronds that give it its common name. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in shaded, rocky habitats. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Hemionitis hirta is considered a sensitive indicator of ecological health.</p>
