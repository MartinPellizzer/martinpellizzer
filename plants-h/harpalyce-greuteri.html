                    <h1>Harpalyce greuteri</h1>
<p>Harpalyce greuteri, commonly known as the desert harpalyce, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its seeds are enclosed in hairy pods, which aid in dispersal by wind and animals.</p>
<p>Harpalyce greuteri plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
