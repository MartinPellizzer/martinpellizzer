                    <h1>Helianthemum montanum var. microphyllum</h1>
<p>Helianthemum montanum var. microphyllum, commonly known as the alpine sunflower or dwarf rock rose, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, upright stems covered in dense, silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight and reduces water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and dry, sunny environments due to its drought tolerance and hardy nature.</p>
