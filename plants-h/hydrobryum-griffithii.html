<p>Hydrobryum griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's water clover, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the family Pottioideae.</p>
<p>It is native to the wetlands of northern India and is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that form a rosette structure. The plant thrives in shallow, still waters and is often found in marshy environments with muddy substrates. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters at the water's surface.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and pollution, Hydrobryum griffithii is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
