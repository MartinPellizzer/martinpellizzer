<p>Habenaria leptocaulon, commonly known as the slender-stemmed marsh orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and forest floors. The plant features a slender, erect stem with a few leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers. Its roots are often found in dense, fibrous mats, which help in nutrient absorption from the soil.</p>
<p>The orchid's botanical structure reflects its adaptation to wet, nutrient-poor habitats.</p>
