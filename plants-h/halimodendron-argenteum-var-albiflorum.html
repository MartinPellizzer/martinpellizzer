<p>Halimodendron argenteum var. albiflorum, commonly known as silverleaf halimodendron, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring, adding ornamental value to its drought-tolerant appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
<p>Its adaptability makes it a resilient choice for landscaping in semi-arid climates.</p>
