                    <h1>Hadrolaelia brevipedunculata</h1>
<p>Hadrolaelia brevipedunculata, commonly known as the short-stemmed orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, spurred flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and green. The plant features a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its harsh, mountainous environment. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in the cold, arid conditions it inhabits.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
