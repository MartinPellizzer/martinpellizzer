                    <h1>Hedera hibernica var. maculata</h1>
<p>Hedera hibernica var. maculata, commonly known as the spotted ivy, is a variant of the common ivy characterized by its distinctive variegated foliage.</p>
<p>Its leaves are typically a mix of green and white or cream, creating a striking visual contrast. This plant is a climbing species that can grow on walls, trees, or trellises, often forming dense mats. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is relatively low maintenance.</p>
<p>The variegation is due to genetic mutations that affect chlorophyll production in certain leaf areas.</p>
