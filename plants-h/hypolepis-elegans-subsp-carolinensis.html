<p>Hypolepis elegans subsp.</p>
<p>carolinensis, commonly known as the Carolina sword fern, is a fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a delicate, sword-like appearance.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while facilitating vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, or sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
