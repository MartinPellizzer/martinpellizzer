                    <h1>Hieracium niphobium</h1>
<p>Hieracium niphobium, commonly known as the snow dandelion, is a perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces yellow, dandelion-like flowers that bloom in early spring, typically between March and May. Its leaves are basal, hairy, and arranged in a rosette, adapted to retain heat and moisture.</p>
<p>Hieracium niphobium is often found in rocky soils and is an important component of alpine flora.</p>
