                    <h1>Hymenophyllum horizontale</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum horizontale, commonly known as the horizontal fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, creeping rhizomes and dense, overlapping fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The fronds are usually dark green and covered with a fine, silky coating, which helps reduce water loss in its moist, shaded habitats. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices, often growing on decaying wood or stone.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and preference for specific microhabitats make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
