                            <h1>Hypericum Villosum</h1>
<p>Yellow st. john's wort, scientifically known as Hypericum villosum, is a flowering plant native to North America, particularly found in moist woodlands and shaded areas. It is recognized for its vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a splash of color to the underbrush. The plant has small, leafy stems covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive, rugged appearance. While it shares a name with the more well-known Hypericum perforatum, Hypericum villosum has unique ecological and medicinal properties. This lesser-known species plays an important role in supporting local biodiversity and has been studied for its potential herbal uses.</p>
