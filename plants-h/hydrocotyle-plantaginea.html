<p>Hydrocotyle plantaginea, commonly known as the water pennywort, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often floating or submerged, depending on the water level. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle plantaginea plays a role in stabilizing sediment and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
