                            <h1>Hieracium Hypophalacrum</h1>
<p>Hieracium hypophalacrum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the sunflower family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy stems. This plant often grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and open woodlands. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread. Its ecological impact and ornamental value make it a subject of both admiration and concern.</p>
