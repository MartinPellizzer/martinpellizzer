                    <h1>Herpestis occultans</h1>
<p>Herpestis occultans, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, showy white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and habitat loss, Herpestis occultans is considered critically endangered.</p>
