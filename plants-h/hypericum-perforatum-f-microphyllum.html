                    <h1>Hypericum perforatum f. microphyllum</h1>
<p>Hypericum perforatum f. microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved St. John's wort, is a botanical variant of the common St. John's wort.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reduced leaf size compared to the typical form, with leaves that are smaller and more densely packed. The plant retains the general features of Hypericum perforatum, including the presence of yellow flowers and the distinctive yellowish dots on the leaves. It is typically found in moist, sunny habitats such as meadows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>This form is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphological traits and potential ecological adaptations.</p>
