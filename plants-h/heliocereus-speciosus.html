<p>Heliocereus speciosus, commonly known as the sun cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, fragrant, night-blooming flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. These flowers open only during the night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths.</p>
<p>Heliocereus speciosus is adapted to arid environments, with thick, fleshy stems that store water and reduce transpiration.</p>
