                    <h1>Humata dryopteridifrons</h1>
<p>Humata dryopteridifrons, commonly known as the golden fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow fronds, which contrast sharply with its dark green base. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with a delicate, feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Humata dryopteridifrons is considered a conservation concern in many parts of its range.</p>
