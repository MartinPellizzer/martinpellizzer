                    <h1>Hordeum pusillum var. flexuosum</h1>
<p>Hordeum pusillum var. flexuosum, commonly known as the creeping barley, is a small annual grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its narrow, linear leaves are covered with fine hairs, and it produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers in spikelets.</p>
<p>This variety is often considered a weed but has historical significance in agricultural studies.</p>
