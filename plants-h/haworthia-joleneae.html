                    <h1>Haworthia joleneae</h1>
<p>Haworthia joleneae, commonly known as the "Jolene's Haworthia," is a compact, succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves with white tubercles and translucent tips, which help it store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, white to pale purple flowers during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and rockeries.</p>
