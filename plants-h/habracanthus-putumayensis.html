<p>Habracanthus putumayensis, commonly known as the Andean starflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Onagraceae, which includes species such as willows and evening primroses. The plant is characterized by its star-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Habracanthus putumayensis is often found growing in rocky soils and is adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its alpine habitat.</p>
