<p>Heldreichia rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leafed heldreichia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, rounded leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered vulnerable and requires protection.</p>
