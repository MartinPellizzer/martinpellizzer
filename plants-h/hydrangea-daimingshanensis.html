<p>Hydrangea daimingshanensis, commonly known as the Daimingshan hydrangea, is a rare species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Hydrangeaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy bracts that can range in color from white to pink depending on soil pH. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and thrives in temperate climates. Its flowers are often clustered in inflorescences, and it produces small, greenish flowers that are less showy than the bracts.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
