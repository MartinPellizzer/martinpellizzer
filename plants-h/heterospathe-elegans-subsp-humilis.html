<p>Heterospathe elegans subsp.</p>
<p>humilis, commonly known as the slender swamp fern, is a terrestrial fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into narrow segments, giving it a feathery appearance. Its rhizomes are usually short and creeping, allowing it to spread along the ground.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
