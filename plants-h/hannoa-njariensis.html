<p>Hannoa njariensis, commonly known as the Malagasy sandalwood, is a rare and endemic species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood, which is highly valued for its unique scent. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to the arid conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, Hannoa njariensis is considered critically endangered.</p>
