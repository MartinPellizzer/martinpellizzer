                    <h1>Hutera rupestris</h1>
<p>Hutera rupestris, commonly known as the rock hutera, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are adapted to store water, making it well-suited for arid environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hutera rupestris thrives in rocky soils and can often be found growing on cliffs or in rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
