<p>Hieracium gigantellum, commonly known as the giant hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are typically hairy and have a rough texture. It spreads primarily through rhizomes and can form dense colonies, often invading grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive nature, it is considered a problematic weed in many regions.</p>
