                    <h1>Hibiscus calcicola</h1>
<p>Hibiscus calcicola, commonly known as the limestone hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils, often found on rocky outcrops and limestone formations. Its flowering period typically occurs during the rainy season, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
<p>Hibiscus calcicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens.</p>
