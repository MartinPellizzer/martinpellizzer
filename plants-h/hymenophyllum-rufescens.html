<p>Hymenophyllum rufescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed filmy fern, is a species of polypodioid fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that are often covered in a fine, waxy layer. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are short and thick, often forming dense mats on rocky or humus-rich substrates.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an important component of epiphytic and lithophytic ecosystems.</p>
