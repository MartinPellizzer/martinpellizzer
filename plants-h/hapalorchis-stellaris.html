                    <h1>Hapalorchis stellaris</h1>
<p>Hapalorchis stellaris, commonly known as the starry liver fluke, is a parasitic trematode belonging to the family Opisthorchiidae.</p>
<p>It is primarily found in the bile ducts of its host, typically certain species of fish and mammals. The adult fluke has a distinctive, star-like appearance due to its branched, radiating structure. Its life cycle involves multiple hosts, including snails and freshwater fish, before reaching its definitive host.</p>
<p>The plant-like appearance of the fluke is a key feature in its identification and classification.</p>
