<p>Hieracium × obornyanum subsp.</p>
<p>nadravicum, commonly known as the Nadravicum hawkweed, is a hybrid species within the dandelion family (Compositae). It is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and lance-shaped leaves, typical of the genus Hieracium.</p>
<p>This subspecies is native to Central and Eastern Europe, often found in meadows and grassy areas. It produces numerous seeds dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread across various habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits variability in morphology and is often difficult to distinguish from closely related species.</p>
