<p>Hypericum repens, commonly known as creeping St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate or spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, oval, and slightly hairy, with a reddish underside.</p>
<p>Hypericum repens is often found in moist, sandy soils and is known for its medicinal properties, though it is also considered an invasive species in some regions.</p>
