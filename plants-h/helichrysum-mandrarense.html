                    <h1>Helichrysum mandrarense</h1>
<p>Helichrysum mandrarense, commonly known as the Cape golden bush, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of yellow, golden, or orange flowers that resemble small suns. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting flowers, which retain their color even when dried.</p>
