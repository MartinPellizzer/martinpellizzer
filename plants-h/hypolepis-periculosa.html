<p>Hypolepis periculosa, commonly known as the dangerous holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its fronds are typically dark green with a slightly glossy texture, and the plant can grow up to several feet in height.</p>
<p>Hypolepis periculosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it requires careful handling due to its potentially irritant properties.</p>
