                    <h1>Haageocereus weberbaueri var. horridispinus</h1>
<p>Haageocereus weberbaueri var. horridispinus, commonly known as the spiny night blooming cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in sharp, backward-pointing spines, which provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces large, fragrant, white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and cactus collections.</p>
