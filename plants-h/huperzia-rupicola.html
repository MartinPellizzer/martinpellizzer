                    <h1>Huperzia rupicola</h1>
<p>Huperzia rupicola, commonly known as the rock huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and is typically found growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its leaves. Huperzia rupicola is well adapted to rocky habitats, often thriving in areas with poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
