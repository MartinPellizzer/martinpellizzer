<p>Haworthia cooperi var. truncata, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a compact, rosette-forming succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features striking, fleshy leaves with white to yellowish markings that resemble a zebra's stripes, giving it its common name. The plant has a slow growth rate and is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance for low light and minimal water requirements. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers on slender stems during the warmer months.</p>
<p>The leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted for storing water, making it drought-tolerant and ideal for rock gardens or container planting.</p>
