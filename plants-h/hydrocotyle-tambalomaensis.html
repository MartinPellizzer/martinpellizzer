<p>Hydrocotyle tambalomaensis, commonly known as the Trinidadian water shield, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araliaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the island of Trinidad and is typically found in wetland habitats such as marshes and along the edges of freshwater bodies. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often floating or submerged, with a waxy surface that helps it thrive in aquatic environments. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its roots are adapted for absorbing nutrients from the water.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle tambalomaensis plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its wetland habitat by providing shelter and food for various aquatic organisms.</p>
