                    <h1>Hydrocotyle dregeana</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle dregeana, commonly known as the African water shield, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle dregeana is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of water bodies, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils.</p>
