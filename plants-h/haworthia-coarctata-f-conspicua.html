                    <h1>Haworthia coarctata f. conspicua</h1>
<p>Haworthia coarctata f. conspicua, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves with striking white to light green markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The leaves are short and upright, often covered in a fine layer of white wax that gives them a powdery appearance. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months.</p>
<p>This plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light.</p>
