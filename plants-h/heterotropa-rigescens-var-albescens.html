                    <h1>Heterotropa rigescens var. albescens</h1>
<p>Heterotropa rigescens var. albescens, commonly known as the white-flowered heterotropa, is a striking member of the Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are often borne on short pedicels and have five lobes, typical of the genus.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its pale coloration, which sets it apart from the more common green-flowered forms of the species.</p>
