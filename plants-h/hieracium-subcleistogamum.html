                    <h1>Hieracium subcleistogamum</h1>
<p>Hieracium subcleistogamum, commonly known as the cleistogamous hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its closed, self-fertile flowers that do not open, a reproductive strategy that ensures pollination even in adverse conditions. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique reproductive biology and ecological adaptations.</p>
