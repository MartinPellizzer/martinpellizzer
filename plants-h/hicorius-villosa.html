                    <h1>Hicorius villosa</h1>
<p>Hicorius villosa, commonly known as the hairy tamarisk, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, pink or reddish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are small, scale-like, and often appear as tufts at the base of the stems.</p>
<p>Hicorius villosa is adapted to poor soils and is often found in desert scrub and washland habitats.</p>
