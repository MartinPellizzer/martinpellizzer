                    <h1>Hemionitis pedata</h1>
<p>Hemionitis pedata, commonly known as the waterwheel plant, is a unique aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves that resemble the spokes of a wheel, giving it its common name. The plant has a distinctive floating structure called a "float" that helps it remain buoyant on the water's surface. Its leaves are thin and ribbon-like, with a waxy coating that reduces water loss.</p>
<p>Hemionitis pedata is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, where it plays a role in supporting aquatic ecosystems.</p>
