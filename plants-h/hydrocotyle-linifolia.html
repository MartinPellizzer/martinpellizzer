<p>Hydrocotyle linifolia, commonly known as marsh mallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a distinctive waxy surface. The plant produces white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in shallow water.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle linifolia is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality.</p>
