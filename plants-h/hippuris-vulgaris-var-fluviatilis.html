                    <h1>Hippuris vulgaris var. fluviatilis</h1>
<p>Hippuris vulgaris var. fluviatilis, commonly known as the river water-plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant that thrives in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It is commonly found in slow-moving streams, ponds, and marshy areas, where it forms dense vegetation.</p>
<p>Its presence is an indicator of good water quality and is valued for its ecological role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
