                    <h1>Hymenophyllum involucratum</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum involucratum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, soft, and velvety fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant is typically found growing on tree trunks or rocks in moist, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are closely packed and have a dense, moss-like texture, which helps it retain moisture.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and they are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
