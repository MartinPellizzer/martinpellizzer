<p>It has long, flexible stems that can grow up to several meters in length, often forming dense underwater mats. The leaves are narrow, elongated, and have a serrated margin, which distinguishes it from other hydrilla species. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically submerged, followed by small, round fruits.</p>
<p>This plant is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as lakes and ponds.</p>
