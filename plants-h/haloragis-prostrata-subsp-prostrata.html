<p>Haloragis prostrata subsp.</p>
<p>prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate waterplantain, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats near water bodies, such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams, where it thrives in moist to submerged conditions.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often submerged or floating, with small, white or pale flowers that appear in clusters. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize aquatic environments effectively.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sediments and improve water quality.</p>
