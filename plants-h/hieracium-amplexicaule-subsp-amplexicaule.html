<p>Hieracium amplexicaule subsp.</p>
<p>amplexicaule, commonly known as the clasping hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, lobed leaves that clasp the stem, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments.</p>
