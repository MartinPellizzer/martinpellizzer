                    <h1>Hieracium salense</h1>
<p>Hieracium salense, commonly known as the saltgrass hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is often found in saline or coastal soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid or salty environments.</p>
<p>Hieracium salense is an important pioneer species in coastal succession, helping to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion.</p>
