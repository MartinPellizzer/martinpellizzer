<p>Hieracium bupleurifolium subsp.</p>
<p>chaetothyrsoides, commonly known as the hairy thistle or chaetothyrsoid hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and leaves with a distinctive, often lobed structure.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides.</p>
<p>Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the nominate form, particularly in leaf and stem hair characteristics.</p>
