<p>Hordeum maritimum subsp.</p>
<p>pubescens, commonly known as sea barley, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and hairy leaves, which help it retain moisture in saline environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered at the tips of the stems, with small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shores and dunes, showing adaptability to harsh maritime conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of coastal vegetation and a subject of study in ecological and taxonomic research.</p>
