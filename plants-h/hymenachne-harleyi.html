<p>Hymenachne harleyi, commonly known as the narrowleaf flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are often hidden among the foliage. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Hymenachne harleyi plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and serving as a food source for some aquatic animals.</p>
