<p>Hedlundia buekkensis, commonly known as the Buekkensis flax, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. Hedlundia buekkensis is adapted to harsh, arid environments and requires well-drained soil and full sun.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
