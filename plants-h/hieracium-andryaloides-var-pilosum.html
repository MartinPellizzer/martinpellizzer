<p>Hieracium andryaloides var. pilosum, commonly known as the silky hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of basal, woolly, and often reddish leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its hairy foliage and showy flowers, it is both ornamental and ecologically significant in its native habitats.</p>
