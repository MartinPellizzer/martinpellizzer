                            <h1>Heliotropium Humile</h1>
<p>Humile heliotrope, scientifically known as Heliotropium humile, is a small flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of fragrant, violet-colored flowers that bloom throughout the warmer months. This species thrives in sandy soils and is often found in dune environments where it plays a vital role in stabilizing the ecosystem. Despite its modest size, the plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance. Its unique adaptations to coastal conditions make it a fascinating subject for botanical study.</p>
