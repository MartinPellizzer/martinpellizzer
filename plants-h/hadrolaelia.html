                    <h1>Hadrolaelia</h1>
<p>Hadrolaelia, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. They are characterized by their striking, golden-yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Hadrolaelia species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>Their botanical significance lies in their unique adaptations to high-altitude environments and their role in the biodiversity of the Andean cloud forests.</p>
