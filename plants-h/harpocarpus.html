<p>Harpocarpus, commonly known as the "cork tree," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique fruit structure, which consists of a woody, spiny capsule that encloses the seeds. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, well-drained soils. Harpocarpus species are known for their thick, cork-like bark, which provides structural support and helps in water retention.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually alternate and have a palmate or lobed shape, contributing to the plant's ornamental value.</p>
