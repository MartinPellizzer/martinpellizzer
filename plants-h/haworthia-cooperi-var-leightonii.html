<p>Haworthia cooperi var. leightonii, commonly known as the "Leighton's Haworthia," is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense rosettes of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically pale green to bluish-gray with white or yellowish markings. The leaves are covered in a fine, powdery coating that helps reduce water loss, a common adaptation in arid environments. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the spring or early summer.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
