                    <h1>Heloniopsis umbellata</h1>
<p>Heloniopsis umbellata, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Heloniopsis umbellata plays an important role in supporting pollinators and is often found in disturbed or rocky habitats.</p>
