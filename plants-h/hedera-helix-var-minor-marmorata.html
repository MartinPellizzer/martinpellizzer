                    <h1>Hedera helix var. minor-marmorata</h1>
<p>Hedera helix var. minor-marmorata, commonly known as the marble evergreen ivy, is a variant of the common ivy characterized by its distinctive variegated foliage.</p>
<p>Its leaves are typically smaller than those of the standard Hedera helix, with a mottled pattern of green, white, and sometimes yellow. This plant is a climbing evergreen vine that thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark berries, though these are less prominent than its ornamental foliage.</p>
<p>The marble evergreen ivy is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for ground cover or as a decorative climbing plant.</p>
