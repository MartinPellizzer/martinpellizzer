<p>Hieracium viscosum subsp.</p>
<p>pseudocerinthopsis, commonly known as the sticky hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which contribute to its sticky texture.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats.</p>
