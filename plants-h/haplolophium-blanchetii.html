<p>Haplolophium blanchetii, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers during the spring, which are fragrant and attract pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for gardeners in temperate climates.</p>
