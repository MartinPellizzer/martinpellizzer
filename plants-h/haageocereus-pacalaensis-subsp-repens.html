<p>Haageocereus pacalaensis subsp.</p>
<p>repens, commonly known as the creeping night-blooming cereus, is a cactus species native to southern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling stems that form a dense mat on the ground.</p>
<p>The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pale pink. These flowers emit a strong fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to arid environments, with thick, fleshy stems that store water and reduce transpiration.</p>
