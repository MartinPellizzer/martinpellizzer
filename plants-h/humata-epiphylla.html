<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in the canopy of rainforests. The plant is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage, which reflects light and helps reduce water loss. Its flowers, which appear in clusters, are typically white or pale purple and emit a subtle fragrance.</p>
