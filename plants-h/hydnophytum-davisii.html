                    <h1>Hydnophytum davisii</h1>
<p>Hydnophytum davisii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, leafless appearance and lack of true roots. The plant obtains nutrients through its specialized roots that form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria. It produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom during the wet season.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Hydnophytum davisii is listed as critically endangered.</p>
