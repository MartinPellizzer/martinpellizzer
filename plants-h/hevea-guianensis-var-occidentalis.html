                    <h1>Hevea guianensis var. occidentalis</h1>
<p>Hevea guianensis var. occidentalis, commonly known as the Western Guianese rubber tree, is a species native to South America, particularly found in regions of Guyana and Suriname.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and large, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant is notable for its latex-producing properties, which can be tapped for natural rubber, though it is less commercially significant than other hevea species.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes providing habitat for various wildlife species and contributing to the biodiversity of tropical rainforests.</p>
