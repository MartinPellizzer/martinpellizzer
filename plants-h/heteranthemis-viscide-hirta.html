                    <h1>Heteranthemis viscide-hirta</h1>
<p>Heteranthemis viscide-hirta, commonly known as the sticky-hairy heteranthemis, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, commonly referred to as the ice plant family, which is characterized by its succulent leaves and showy flowers. The plant is notable for its hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in a raceme, and display a range of colors from pink to purple.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
