                    <h1>Halgania viscosa</h1>
<p>Halgania viscosa, commonly known as the sticky thornapple, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems covered in a sticky resin, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by distinctive, spiny fruits. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Halgania viscosa is adapted to survive in harsh environments and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
