<p>tephraeum, commonly known as the volcanic hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to regions affected by volcanic activity. It typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in areas with high mineral content.</p>
<p>The plant features basal rosettes of lanceolate leaves and produces yellow composite flowers with showy ray florets. It is characterized by its robust growth and adaptability to harsh environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its resilience and role in ecological succession following volcanic eruptions.</p>
