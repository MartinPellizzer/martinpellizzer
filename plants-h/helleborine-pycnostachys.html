                    <h1>Helleborine pycnostachys</h1>
<p>Helleborine pycnostachys, commonly known as the narrow-leaved helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, narrow lance-shaped leaves and its striking, hooded flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple and green. The plant is epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning it can grow on trees or rocks, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly bees, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens.</p>
