<p>Heteranthera catharinensis, commonly known as the Brazilian water hyacinth, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating leaves and showy blue-violet flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer, aiding in buoyancy. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, three-lobed fruits that disperse via water.</p>
<p>Heteranthera catharinensis is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats.</p>
