<p>Haplopappus tasmanicus, commonly known as the Tasmanian burrweed, is a low-growing, annual plant native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately. Its distinctive characteristic is the presence of bristly, persistent pappus structures on the seeds, which aid in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>It is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, contributing to soil stabilization in its native range.</p>
