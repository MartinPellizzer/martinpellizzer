<p>Hieracium sparsiflorum subsp.</p>
<p>sparsiceps, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands, often in sunny locations.</p>
<p>The plant features upright stems with rough, hairy surfaces and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a dense cluster at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
