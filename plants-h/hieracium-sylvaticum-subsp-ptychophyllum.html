<p>Hieracium sylvaticum subsp.</p>
<p>ptychophyllum, commonly known as the woodland hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in its woodland habitat.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a rough texture, often with a bluish-green hue. This subspecies is native to parts of Europe and is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and contributes to the biodiversity of its ecosystem.</p>
