                    <h1>Huperzia pulcherrima</h1>
<p>Huperzia pulcherrima, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of clubmoss native to tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the undersides of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.</p>
<p>Huperzia pulcherrima is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems.</p>
