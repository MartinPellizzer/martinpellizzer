                    <h1>Hemionitis lemmonii</h1>
<p>Hemionitis lemmonii, commonly known as the Lemmon's hemionitis, is a rare and delicate fern native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hemionitidaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in desert environments where it can withstand extreme temperature fluctuations. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying plant adaptation to harsh climates.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Hemionitis lemmonii is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
