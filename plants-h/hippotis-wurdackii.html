<p>Hippotis wurdackii, commonly known as the Wurdack's bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves and specialized structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. It is a carnivorous plant, relying on the nutrients obtained from captured prey to supplement its nutrient intake.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range.</p>
