                    <h1>Hieracium fusculum</h1>
<p>Hieracium fusculum, commonly known as the lesser hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces yellowish to reddish composite flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. It has a fibrous root system and is often found in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its low-growing habit and flowering pattern, it is sometimes mistaken for other hawkweed species but can be distinguished by its leaf structure and flower color.</p>
