<p>Hedysarum velutinum, commonly known as the velvet vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, followed by small, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Hedysarum velutinum is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
