                    <h1>Hymenachne palustris</h1>
<p>Hymenachne palustris, commonly known as swamp grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense mats that help stabilize shorelines. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikes. Its rhizomes are fibrous and contribute to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions.</p>
<p>Hymenachne palustris plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and preventing erosion.</p>
