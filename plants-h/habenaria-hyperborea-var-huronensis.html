<p>Habenaria hyperborea var. huronensis, commonly known as the Huron bog orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. This plant typically grows in moist, acidic bogs and sphagnum moss habitats, thriving in cool, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are fibrous, and it reproduces through seed dispersal and vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many areas.</p>
