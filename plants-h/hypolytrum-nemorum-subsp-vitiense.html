<p>Hypolytrum nemorum subsp.</p>
<p>vitiense, commonly known as the New Zealand ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered plant species native to New Zealand. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that are often greenish-white in color.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rock crevices. It has a sympodial growth habit, with multiple stems arising from a central rhizome.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
