<p>Hymenolepis squamata var. borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean flatworm, is a species of flatworm found in tropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dendrocoelidae and is characterized by its flattened body and segmented structure. This organism is primarily found in moist soil and leaf litter, where it plays a role in decomposing organic matter. It lacks a true digestive system and absorbs nutrients through its skin.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and cryptic behavior, it is often overlooked in ecological studies.</p>
