                    <h1>Hydastylus parvus</h1>
<p>Hydastylus parvus, commonly known as the small water lily, is a aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features broad, floating leaves that provide shade for aquatic life and help reduce water temperature. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of water bodies, allowing it to thrive in still or slow-moving waters.</p>
<p>Hydastylus parvus plays a vital role in maintaining water quality and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
