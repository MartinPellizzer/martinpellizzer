                    <h1>Holographis pallida</h1>
<p>Holographis pallida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant is characterized by its pale, almost translucent leaves and a single, delicate white or greenish-white flower. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Holographis pallida is considered critically endangered.</p>
