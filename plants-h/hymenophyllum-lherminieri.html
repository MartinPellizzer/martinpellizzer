<p>Hymenophyllum lherminieri, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, velvety fronds covered in fine, silky hairs, which give it a soft, moss-like appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum lherminieri is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in specialty gardens.</p>
