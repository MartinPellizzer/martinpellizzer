<p>Helictotrichon altaicum, commonly known as the Alaska bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments, often found in tundra and alpine meadows. The plant has slender,丛生 (clumping) stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces tiny blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Helictotrichon altaicum plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic wildlife.</p>
