<p>Hieracium subbetuletorum, commonly known as the birchleaf hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the daisy family. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a bluish-green hue, which distinguishes it from other hawkweed species.</p>
<p>Native to Europe, it thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows.</p>
