<p>Haworthia fasciata var. caespitosa, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a compact, rosette-forming succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features striking, fleshy leaves with white to yellowish markings that resemble a zebra's stripes, giving it its common name. The plant is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and thick, waxy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. It produces small, greenish-white flowers on tall stems during the spring or early summer.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its low maintenance and unique appearance.</p>
