                    <h1>Hermione candidissima</h1>
<p>Hermione candidissima, commonly known as the moonlight lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking white petals that resemble moonlight, hence its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom during the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are broad and slightly hairy, adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its mountainous habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hermione candidissima is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
