                    <h1>Humboltia crepidophylla</h1>
<p>Humboltia crepidophylla, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on the branches of certain coniferous trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant produces small, white berries that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds. It is native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>Its unique life cycle and specialized adaptation to parasitic growth make it an interesting subject in botanical studies.</p>
