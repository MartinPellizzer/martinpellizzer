<p>Haworthia schuldtiana var. simplicior, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with distinct white or light-colored markings resembling a zebra's stripes. The leaves are usually short and have a waxy texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in arid conditions. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for rock gardens or as a potted plant due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements.</p>
