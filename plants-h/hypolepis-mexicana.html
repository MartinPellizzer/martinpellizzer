<p>Hypolepis mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican water fern, is a species of fern native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are often submerged or floating in water. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that allow it to spread across aquatic environments. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Hypolepis mexicana is often found in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats.</p>
