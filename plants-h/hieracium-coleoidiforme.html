                    <h1>Hieracium coleoidiforme</h1>
<p>Hieracium coleoidiforme, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features hairy, rough-textured leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense mats.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it can outcompete native flora and is sometimes considered a weed.</p>
