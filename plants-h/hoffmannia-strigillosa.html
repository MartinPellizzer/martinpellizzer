                    <h1>Hoffmannia strigillosa</h1>
<p>Hoffmannia strigillosa, commonly known as the hairy Hoffmannia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the arid regions of South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting various pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, Hoffmannia strigillosa is of interest to botanists studying xerophytic plants.</p>
