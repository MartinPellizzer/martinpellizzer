                    <h1>Heteroneuron × proliferum</h1>
<p>Heteroneuron × proliferum, commonly known as the hybrid sweet flag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments.</p>
<p>It features long, slender rhizomes that help it spread vegetatively and establish dense colonies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a wetland indicator species and its use in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>The hybrid nature of Heteroneuron × proliferum results from the cross between Heteroneuron juncoides and Heteroneuron proliferum, contributing to its adaptability and ecological resilience.</p>
