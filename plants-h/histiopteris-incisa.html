<p>Histiopteris incisa, commonly known as the cut-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing structures called sori.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually green and can develop a reddish hue when exposed to full sun.</p>
