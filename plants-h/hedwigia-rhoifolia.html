                    <h1>Hedwigia rhoifolia</h1>
<p>Hedwigia rhoifolia, commonly known as the desert hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a compact, shrub-like structure. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its adaptations to desert conditions include thick, fleshy stems for water storage and reduced leaves to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Hedwigia rhoifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in hot, dry environments.</p>
