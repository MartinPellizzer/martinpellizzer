                    <h1>Heliocarpus floribundus</h1>
<p>Heliocarpus floribundus, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or yellow ironwood, is a tropical tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, spiny fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and high demand, it is considered a threatened species in its native habitat.</p>
