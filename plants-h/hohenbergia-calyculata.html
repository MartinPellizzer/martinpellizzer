                    <h1>Hohenbergia calyculata</h1>
<p>Hohenbergia calyculata, commonly known as the silver rosette, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, dense rosette of narrow, silver-blue leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking white or pink flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, adding a dramatic visual contrast. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Hohenbergia calyculata is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its elegant appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
