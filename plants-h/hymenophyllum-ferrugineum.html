<p>Hymenophyllum ferrugineum, commonly known as the rusty fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its fronds are lance-shaped and covered with a dense layer of fine, hairy scales. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum ferrugineum is notable for its ability to tolerate low light and high humidity, making it a popular choice for tropical gardens.</p>
