<p>Hymenophyllum lingganum, commonly known as the linggan moss, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are closely clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum lingganum is notable for its unique morphology and ecological role in maintaining forest floor microhabitats.</p>
