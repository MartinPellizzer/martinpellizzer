                    <h1>Hakea rudis</h1>
<p>Hakea rudis, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces bright red or orange flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody structure and ability to thrive in sandy or coastal soils make it well adapted to harsh environments.</p>
<p>Hakea rudis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
