<p>Hemiorchis pantlingii, commonly known as the Pantling's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes a distinctive lip and column typical of many orchid genera. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it can receive adequate light for photosynthesis. Its flowers are usually small and fragrant, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Hemiorchis pantlingii is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts.</p>
