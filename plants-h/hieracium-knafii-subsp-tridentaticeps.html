<p>Hieracium knafii subsp.</p>
<p>tridentaticeps, commonly known as the three-lobed hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Its flowers are composed of numerous small florets arranged in a disk, typical of the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is considered a weed in some agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively.</p>
