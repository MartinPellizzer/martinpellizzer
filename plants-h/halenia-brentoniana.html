                    <h1>Halenia brentoniana</h1>
<p>Halenia brentoniana, commonly known as the Natal orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or wooded areas and thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.</p>
