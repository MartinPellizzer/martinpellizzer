<p>Hieracium atratum subsp.</p>
<p>sasellae, commonly known as the Black Hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, hairy leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from other Hieracium species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native range.</p>
