<p>Hakea ledifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to south-western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces striking red or orange flower spikes in spring, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Hakea ledifolia is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for coastal gardens.</p>
<p>Its unique foliage and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for landscaping in Mediterranean climates.</p>
