<p>Henslowia nivalis, commonly known as the snow henslowia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a low-growing habit with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in rocky crevices or on mountain slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Henslowia nivalis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
