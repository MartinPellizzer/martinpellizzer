<p>Hieracium onosmoides subsp.</p>
<p>geisenheyneri, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it forms dense mats or cushions.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is characterized by its compact growth form and is often found in mountainous habitats across the Alps.</p>
