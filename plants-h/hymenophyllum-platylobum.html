<p>Hymenophyllum platylobum, commonly known as the broad-lobed hymenophyllum, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on the bark of trees in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are delicate and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are enclosed in small, cup-like structures called sorus.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum platylobum is found in various regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India, China, and Indonesia.</p>
