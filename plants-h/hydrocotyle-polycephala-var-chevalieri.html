                    <h1>Hydrocotyle polycephala var. chevalieri</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle polycephala var. chevalieri, commonly known as the Chevalier's marsh mallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom during the warmer months. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common sight in marshy areas.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to saturated soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems.</p>
