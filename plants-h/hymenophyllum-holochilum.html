<p>Hymenophyllum holochilum, commonly known as the green moss-fern, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a unique reproductive structure called a sorus, which is clustered on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its intricate morphology and specialized habitat make it an important species in the study of fern biology and ecological diversity.</p>
