                    <h1>Halodendrum</h1>
<p>Halodendrum, commonly known as the saltbush, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia and the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>These plants are adapted to saline and drought conditions, featuring succulent leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. Halodendrum species typically have small, green or yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the cooler months. Their root systems are extensive, allowing them to access deep water sources in poor soils.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to thrive in harsh environments makes it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
