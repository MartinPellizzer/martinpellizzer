<p>Habenaria flexa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often near the base of trees or on rocky substrates. The plant produces slender, grass-like leaves and bears small, pale green or white flowers with intricate patterns. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
