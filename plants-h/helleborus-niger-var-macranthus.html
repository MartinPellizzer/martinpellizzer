<p>Helleborus niger var. macranthus, commonly known as the Christmas rose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Alps and central Europe.</p>
<p>It features thick, waxy, evergreen leaves that remain throughout the winter, providing structure to the garden even when other plants are dormant. The plant produces large, showy white to pale pink flowers in early spring, typically around Christmas time, hence its common name. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained, fertile soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>The flowers are highly fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
