                    <h1>Haworthia coriacea</h1>
<p>Haworthia coriacea, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped foliage with distinctive white to light green markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water, allowing the plant to thrive in arid conditions. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months.</p>
<p>Haworthia coriacea is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and unique appearance.</p>
