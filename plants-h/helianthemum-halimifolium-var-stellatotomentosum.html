<p>Helianthemum halimifolium var. stellatotomentosum, commonly known as the star-tomentose rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It features dense, woolly foliage covered in fine, star-shaped hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is well adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
