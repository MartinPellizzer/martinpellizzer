                    <h1>Hermione × biscrenata</h1>
<p>Hermione × biscrenata, commonly known as the hybrid ivy, is a vigorous climbing plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly waxy texture and a strong, clinging habit that allows it to scale walls and structures. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-white flowers in clusters during the late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to cover unsightly surfaces.</p>
<p>However, due to its aggressive growth, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive.</p>
