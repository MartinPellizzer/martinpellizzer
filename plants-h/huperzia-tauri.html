<p>Huperzia tauri, commonly known as the Taurian clubmoss, is a species of primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, scale-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Huperzia tauri is notable for its spore-producing structures called strobili, which are clustered at the tips of its branches.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists due to its ancient lineage and its role in studying the evolution of early land plants.</p>
