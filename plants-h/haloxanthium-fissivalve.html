                    <h1>Haloxanthium fissivalve</h1>
<p>Haloxanthium fissivalve, commonly known as the fissile sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and flies. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Haloxanthium fissivalve is well adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient component of xerophytic vegetation.</p>
