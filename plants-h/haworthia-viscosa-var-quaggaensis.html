                    <h1>Haworthia viscosa var. quaggaensis</h1>
<p>Haworthia viscosa var. quaggaensis, commonly known as the quagga haworthia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with white or translucent markings. The leaves are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or yellow during the warmer months.</p>
<p>This plant is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appearance.</p>
