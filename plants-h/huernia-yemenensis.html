                    <h1>Huernia yemenensis</h1>
<p>Huernia yemenensis, commonly known as the Yemen star cactus, is a succulent plant native to the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rounded stem with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces striking yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, which are borne on short, erect stems. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems to survive drought.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections.</p>
