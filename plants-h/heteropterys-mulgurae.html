                    <h1>Heteropterys mulgurae</h1>
<p>Heteropterys mulgurae, commonly known as the Mulgurae mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the rainforests of northeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its leafless stems and hemiparasitic growth habit, deriving some nutrients from its host tree while performing photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by the development of fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>It plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for birds and other wildlife, and its presence can indicate the health of the surrounding forest habitat.</p>
