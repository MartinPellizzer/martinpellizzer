<p>Herniaria ericifolia, commonly known as the heath herniaria, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers in early summer, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is often found in heathlands and tundra environments.</p>
<p>Herniaria ericifolia plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh climates and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds.</p>
