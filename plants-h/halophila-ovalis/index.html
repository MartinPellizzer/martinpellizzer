                            <h1>Halophila Ovalis</h1>
<p>Halophila ovalis is a seagrass species commonly found in shallow coastal waters around the world. It thrives in brackish and marine environments, often growing in dense underwater meadows. This plant plays a vital role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic species. Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important indicator of coastal water quality. Halophila ovalis is also valued for its contributions to sediment stabilization and carbon sequestration.</p>
