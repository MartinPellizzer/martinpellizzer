                    <h1>Hemicicca</h1>
<p>Hemicicca, commonly known as the desert holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Portulacaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants are typically low-growing shrubs with fleshy, often spiny stems and small, clustered leaves. Hemicicca species are adapted to harsh desert conditions, featuring succulent structures that store water.</p>
<p>They produce small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a touch of color to the otherwise stark desert landscape.</p>
