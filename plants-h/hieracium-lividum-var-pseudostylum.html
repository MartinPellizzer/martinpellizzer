<p>Hieracium lividum var. pseudostylum, commonly known as the pale hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces yellow flowers in a composite head, which are typically arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
