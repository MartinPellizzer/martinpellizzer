                    <h1>Humboltia hypnicola</h1>
<p>Humboltia hypnicola, commonly known as the coastal nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the western coast of the United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils near the coastline. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Humboltia hypnicola is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds.</p>
