                    <h1>Hydrocotyle umbellata</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle umbellata, commonly known as the water pennywort, is a floating aquatic plant native to various regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern on the water surface. The plant produces tiny white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its rhizomes allow it to spread rapidly in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle umbellata plays a role in stabilizing water surfaces and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
