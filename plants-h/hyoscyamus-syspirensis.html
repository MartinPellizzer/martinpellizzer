<p>Hyoscyamus syspirensis, commonly known as the desert jimsonweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its spiny stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, spherical berries containing toxic seeds.

<p>Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by livestock and humans.</p>
