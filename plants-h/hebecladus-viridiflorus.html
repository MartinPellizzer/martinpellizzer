                    <h1>Hebecladus viridiflorus</h1>
<p>Hebecladus viridiflorus, commonly known as the green-flowered hebe, is a member of the Asparagaceae family and is native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, which is an unusual feature for a hebe. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers a sunny to partially shaded location.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
