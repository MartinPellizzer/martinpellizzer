                    <h1>Hofmannia</h1>
<p>Hofmannia, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, most of which are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and southern Europe. The plants typically have succulent stems and leaves adapted to store water, allowing them to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Hofmannia species produce showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are often brightly colored, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds.</p>
<p>These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with warm, dry climates.</p>
