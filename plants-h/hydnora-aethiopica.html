                    <h1>Hydnora aethiopica</h1>
<p>Hydnora aethiopica, commonly known as the African starwood, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It grows exclusively on the roots of certain host plants, primarily in the Karoo region of South Africa. The plant produces a distinctive, fleshy, reddish structure that resembles a star, which is adapted for attracting pollinators. Its flowers are pollinated by flies, which are drawn to its strong, unpleasant odor.</p>
<p>Due to its unique biology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
