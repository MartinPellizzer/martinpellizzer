                    <h1>Hypolytrum heterophyllum</h1>
<p>Hypolytrum heterophyllum, commonly known as the variable hypolytrum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and vibrant, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as rainforests, where it thrives in the understory. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help reduce water loss and protect against herbivores.</p>
<p>The flowers, which are usually red or orange, attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bees, playing a role in the plant's reproductive success.</p>
