                    <h1>Homalomena sagittifolia var. angustifolia</h1>
<p>Homalomena sagittifolia var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf arrowhead plant, is a tropical evergreen perennial belonging to the Araceae family.</p>
<p>It features arrow-shaped, dark green leaves that are narrower than those of the typical variety, giving it a more refined appearance. The plant produces striking, spatulate-shaped inflorescences with small, white flowers surrounded by a colorful spathe. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil.</p>
<p>This variant is prized for its ornamental value and adaptability to indoor cultivation.</p>
