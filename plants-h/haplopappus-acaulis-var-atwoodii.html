                    <h1>Haplopappus acaulis var. atwoodii</h1>
<p>Haplopappus acaulis var. atwoodii, commonly known as the Atwood's hairy pappus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, grayish-green leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by fluffy, white pappus structures that aid in wind pollination. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
