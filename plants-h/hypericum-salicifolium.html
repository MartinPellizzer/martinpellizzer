                    <h1>Hypericum salicifolium</h1>
<p>Hypericum salicifolium, commonly known as the willow-leaf St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, willow-like leaves that are lanceolate and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in woodland edges and meadows.</p>
<p>Its medicinal properties have been historically valued, though its use is now largely restricted due to its potential interactions with other medications.</p>
