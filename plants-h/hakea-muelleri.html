                    <h1>Hakea muelleri</h1>
<p>Hakea muelleri, commonly known as the Mueller's hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical or globose spikes of bright red or orange flowers that appear in late summer to autumn. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces woody, cone-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by animals and wind.</p>
<p>Hakea muelleri is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands.</p>
