                    <h1>Heterothalamus rupestris</h1>
<p>Heterothalamus rupestris, commonly known as the rock heterothalamus, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring two distinct types of flowers on the same inflorescence, a trait known as heterothallism. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are arranged in umbels, and it produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for ecological studies.</p>
