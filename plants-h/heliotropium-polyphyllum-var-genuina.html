                    <h1>Heliotropium polyphyllum var. genuina</h1>
<p>Heliotropium polyphyllum var. genuina, commonly known as the coastal heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming throughout the warmer months. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a rough texture that aids in reducing water loss.</p>
<p>This species is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
