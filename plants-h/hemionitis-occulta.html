                    <h1>Hemionitis occulta</h1>
<p>Hemionitis occulta, commonly known as the hidden hemionite, is a small, terrestrial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish spore cases called sporangia, which are clustered in groups on the underside of its leaves. Hemionitis occulta is native to regions of Asia, particularly in China and India, where it grows in forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas.</p>
