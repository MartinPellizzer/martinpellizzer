                    <h1>Hieracium umbellatum proles eriophorum</h1>
<p>Hieracium umbellatum proles eriophorum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features basal rosettes of serrated, hairy leaves and produces yellow ray florets surrounded by tubular disk florets. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often colonizing roadsides and meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions.</p>
