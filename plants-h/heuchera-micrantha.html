                    <h1>Heuchera micrantha</h1>
<p>Heuchera micrantha, commonly known as the silver leaf heuchera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of velvety, silver-green foliage that contrasts strikingly with its upright flowering stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers during the summer months, which are borne on slender, branching stalks. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, Heuchera micrantha is often cultivated for both its aesthetic appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
