                    <h1>Hieracium triviale f. sejunctum</h1>
<p>Hieracium triviale f. sejunctum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and meadows, and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habit and ability to spread rapidly.</p>
<p>The subspecies sejunctum is distinguished by its more compact growth form and slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical form of H. triviale.</p>
