<p>Hordeum compressum, commonly known as slender barley, is a species of grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, temperate environments and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
