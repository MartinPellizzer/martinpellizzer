<p>Hakea pluricaulis, commonly known as the multi-stemmed hakea, is a shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and its ability to form multiple stems from the base. The plant produces cylindrical, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Hakea pluricaulis is adapted to arid environments and is often found in coastal and sandy soils.</p>
