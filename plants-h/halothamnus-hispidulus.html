                    <h1>Halothamnus hispidulus</h1>
<p>Halothamnus hispidulus, commonly known as the hairy halothamnus, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which provide additional protection against intense sunlight and drought.</p>
<p>Halothamnus hispidulus is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a resilient component of Mediterranean ecosystems.</p>
