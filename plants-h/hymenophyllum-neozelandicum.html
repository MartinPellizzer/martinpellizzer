                    <h1>Hymenophyllum neozelandicum</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum neozelandicum, commonly known as the New Zealand fernlet, is a small, delicate fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, moss-like fronds. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its intricate structure includes a network of tiny, hair-like rhizomes that help it anchor to substrates.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sorus, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a key feature of its reproductive biology.</p>
