                            <h1>Hieracium Juranopsis</h1>
<p>Common hawkweed, scientifically known as Hieracium juranopsis, is a perennial flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy stems, which help it thrive in a variety of habitats. This plant is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, where it spreads rapidly through its extensive root system. Despite its beauty, it is considered an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native flora. Its resilience and adaptability make it a subject of both ecological concern and botanical interest.</p>
