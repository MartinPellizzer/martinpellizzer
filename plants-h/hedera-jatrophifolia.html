<p>Hedera jatrophifolia, commonly known as the Jerusalem ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to the Middle East and parts of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a waxy texture and prominent veins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption.</p>
