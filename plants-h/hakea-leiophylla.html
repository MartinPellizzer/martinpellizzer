                    <h1>Hakea leiophylla</h1>
<p>Hakea leiophylla, commonly known as the smooth-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to western Australia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. The plant produces small, cylindrical yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody structure and ability to thrive in sandy soils make it well-suited to arid environments.</p>
<p>Hakea leiophylla is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness.</p>
