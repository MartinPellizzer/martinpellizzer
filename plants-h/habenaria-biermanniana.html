<p>Habenaria biermanniana, commonly known as the Biermann's orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions like Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes that produce multiple stems each year. Its flowers are usually small and pale green or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable in some areas.</p>
