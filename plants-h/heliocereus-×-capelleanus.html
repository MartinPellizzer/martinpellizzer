                    <h1>Heliocereus × capelleanus</h1>
<p>Heliocereus × capelleanus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a hybrid cactus species native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and spiny, ribbed structure, which helps it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant, white flowers that open at night, a trait that attracts nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it thrives in full sun with minimal water.</p>
<p>The flowers are short-lived, often wilting by dawn, making it a striking but ephemeral plant.</p>
