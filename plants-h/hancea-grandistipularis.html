                    <h1>Hancea grandistipularis</h1>
<p>Hancea grandistipularis, commonly known as the large-stippled hancea, is a unique plant native to the humid lowland forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves with prominent stipules that give it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in the canopy layer of the forest. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in dense inflorescences, and are typically white or pale yellow in color.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Hancea grandistipularis is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
