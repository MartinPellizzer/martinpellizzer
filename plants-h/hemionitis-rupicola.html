                    <h1>Hemionitis rupicola</h1>
<p>Hemionitis rupicola, commonly known as the rock fern, is a unique plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of trichomes, which help reduce water loss. Hemionitis rupicola is adapted to extreme temperatures and low precipitation, making it a resilient species in harsh environments.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
