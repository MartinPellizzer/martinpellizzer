                    <h1>Hydrocotyle abyssinica</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle abyssinica, commonly known as African water shield, is a perennial aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features broad, floating leaves that are typically heart-shaped or rounded, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the early morning. Its rhizomes allow it to spread and form dense mats in still or slow-moving water.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle abyssinica plays a role in stabilizing water bodies and providing habitat for aquatic life.</p>
