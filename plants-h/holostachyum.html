                    <h1>Holostachyum</h1>
<p>Holostachyum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking white, waxy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Holostachyum is considered endangered in many regions.</p>
