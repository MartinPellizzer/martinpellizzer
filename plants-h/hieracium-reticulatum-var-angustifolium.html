                    <h1>Hieracium reticulatum var. angustifolium</h1>
<p>Hieracium reticulatum var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer, arranged in a single head on a slender stem. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides.</p>
<p>Its leaves and flowers are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
