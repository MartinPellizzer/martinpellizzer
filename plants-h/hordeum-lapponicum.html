                    <h1>Hordeum lapponicum</h1>
<p>Hordeum lapponicum, commonly known as Arctic barley, is a species of grass native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing plant that thrives in cold, harsh environments, often found in tundra and alpine habitats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of hairs, helping to reduce water loss in extreme conditions.</p>
<p>Hordeum lapponicum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic flora and fauna.</p>
