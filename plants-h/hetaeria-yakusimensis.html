                    <h1>Hetaeria yakusimensis</h1>
<p>Hetaeria yakusimensis, commonly known as the Yakushima hetaeria, is a rare fern species native to the subtropical forests of Yakushima Island, Japan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hetaeriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that grow in a dense, compact form. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of ancient forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its leaves, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, Hetaeria yakusimensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
