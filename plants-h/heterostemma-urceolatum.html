                    <h1>Heterostemma urceolatum</h1>
<p>Heterostemma urceolatum, commonly known as the urn-shaped mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive appearance with its urn-shaped, fleshy fruit that turns red when mature, often attracting birds for seed dispersal. The plant possesses specialized structures called haustoria, which it uses to penetrate the host's vascular system and extract water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually small, leathery, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>Heterostemma urceolatum plays an important ecological role in its habitat by contributing to the food web and influencing the health of its host trees.</p>
