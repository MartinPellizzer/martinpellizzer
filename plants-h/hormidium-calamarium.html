                    <h1>Hormidium calamarium</h1>
<p>Hormidium calamarium, commonly known as the sea hare orchid, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to coastal regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, sea-green leaves and striking, violet-blue flowers. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils near the shoreline, often in areas with high salinity. Its name reflects its association with marine environments, though it is not a true sea hare.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Hormidium calamarium is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
