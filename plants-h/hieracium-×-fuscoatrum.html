                    <h1>Hieracium × fuscoatrum</h1>
<p>Hieracium × fuscoatrum, commonly known as the hybrid dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Hieracium piloselloides and Hieracium auripigmentum, resulting in a plant with distinctive yellow flowers and lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it produces a composite flower head that develops into a pappus-equipped seed head for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a wide range of morphological variation across its geographic distribution.</p>
