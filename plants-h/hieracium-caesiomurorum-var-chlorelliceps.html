<p>Hieracium caesiomurorum var. chlorelliceps, commonly known as the green-spored hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a flowering head composed of yellow ray florets. The plant produces a unique type of spore-containing structure called a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies.</p>
