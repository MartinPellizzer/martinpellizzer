<p>Hymenophyllum odontophyllum, commonly known as the toothed hymenophyll, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the Hymenophyllaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, moss-like appearance and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. The fronds are typically lance-shaped, with finely divided, toothed margins that give the plant its common name. It produces spores in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This plant is notable for its ability to thrive in high humidity and is often used in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.</p>
