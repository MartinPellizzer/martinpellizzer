<p>Hymenophyllum viridissimum, commonly known as the green fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its leaves are typically bright green and covered with a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum viridissimum is notable for its intricate spore-producing structures called soridia, which are clustered on the underside of its fronds.</p>
