                    <h1>Hiraea silvae</h1>
<p>Hiraea silvae, commonly known as the forest hiraea, is a rare and elusive plant species native to dense, shaded forest environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Hiraea silvae thrives in nutrient-rich, moist soils and is often found in temperate deciduous forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation-sensitive species.</p>
