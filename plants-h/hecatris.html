<p>Hecatris, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a type of orchid that thrives in wet, swampy environments, often growing on the roots of trees. The plant has no leaves and relies entirely on its roots for nutrient absorption. Its flowers are pale green or white, with a unique, delicate appearance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Hecatris is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
