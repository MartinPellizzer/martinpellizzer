<p>Hymenopappus filifolius var. eriopodus, commonly known as the woolly hymenopappus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves covered in dense, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its inflorescence is surrounded by a pappus of bristles, aiding in wind dispersal of its seeds.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems.</p>
