<p>Hieracium aphyllum subsp.</p>
<p>aphyllum, commonly known as the leafless hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with only a rosette of bracts forming the base of the plant.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typically arranged in a single inflorescence at the top of the stem. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and often protected species in many regions.</p>
