<p>Hieracium silsinum subsp.</p>
<p>silsinum, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and tall, branched flowering stems that bear yellow to orange composite flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high elevations. It has a taproot system and produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
