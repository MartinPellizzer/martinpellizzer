                    <h1>Hymenophyllum pendulum</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum pendulum, commonly known as the hanging fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features delicate, pendulous fronds that hang from trees, often in shaded, moist environments. The plant has thin, wiry rhizomes and produces spore-bearing structures called sorus on the underside of its fronds. Its leaves are typically linear and have a velvety texture, which helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum pendulum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions.</p>
