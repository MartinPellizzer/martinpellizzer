<p>Harrisia gracilis var. aboriginum, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a succulent cactus native to arid regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in spiny areoles and produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom at night. The plant is adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments with minimal water requirements. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stem.</p>
<p>The flowers are typically white or pale purple, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths.</p>
