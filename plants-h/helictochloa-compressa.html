<p>Helictochloa compressa, commonly known as the flatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and narrow, flat leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous slender spikelets, which are a defining feature of the genus.</p>
<p>Helictochloa compressa plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range.</p>
