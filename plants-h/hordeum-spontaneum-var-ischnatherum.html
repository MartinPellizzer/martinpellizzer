                    <h1>Hordeum spontaneum var. ischnatherum</h1>
<p>Hordeum spontaneum var. ischnatherum, commonly known as wild barley, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical spikelets and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant is highly resilient, capable of surviving in poor soil conditions and with minimal water. It plays a significant role in ecological systems as a forage plant and in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject in studies of plant adaptation and evolution.</p>
