<p>Hemihabenaria stenantha var. auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate helmet orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, helmet-shaped flower that is often adorned with auriculate (ear-shaped) appendages at the base. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often within montane forests. Its leaves are elongated and narrow, and the flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
