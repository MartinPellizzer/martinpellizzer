                    <h1>Hedera × sepulcralis</h1>
<p>Hedera × sepulcralis, commonly known as the black ivy, is a hybrid species of ivy that originates from the cross between Hedera helix and Hedera rhombea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black foliage, which gives it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are not particularly showy, followed by orange-red berries. It is a climbing plant that thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions.</p>
