<p>Hypochaeris glabra, commonly known as the smooth sow-thistle, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and yellow flower heads that resemble dandelions. The plant typically reaches a height of 10 to 30 centimeters and thrives in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn, producing small seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Hypochaeris glabra is often considered a weed but has been used historically in traditional medicine.</p>
