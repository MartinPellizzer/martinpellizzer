<p>Hymenophyllum semiteres, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hymenophyllum, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the Hymenophyllaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided, and often silvery-green fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective shield known as a indusium.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum semiteres is well adapted to high humidity and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value.</p>
