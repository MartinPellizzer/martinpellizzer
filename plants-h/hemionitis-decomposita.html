                    <h1>Hemionitis decomposita</h1>
<p>Hemionitis decomposita, commonly known as the rock fern, is a rare and unique plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that are divided into small, needle-like segments. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to extreme drought conditions. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, with spores produced in clusters on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Hemionitis decomposita is considered a sensitive indicator species of its ecosystem.</p>
