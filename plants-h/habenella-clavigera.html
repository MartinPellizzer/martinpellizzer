                    <h1>Habenella clavigera</h1>
<p>Habenella clavigera, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap aquatic prey. The plant typically grows in shallow water and has slender, branching stems with small, scale-like leaves. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and are borne on long, slender stalks.</p>
<p>Despite its carnivorous nature, it plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling algae and small invertebrate populations.</p>
