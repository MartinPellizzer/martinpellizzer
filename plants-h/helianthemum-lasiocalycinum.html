<p>Helianthemum lasiocalycinum, commonly known as the sticky rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has hairy, often glandular leaves that give it a sticky texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant.</p>
