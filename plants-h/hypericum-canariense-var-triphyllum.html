                    <h1>Hypericum canariense var. triphyllum</h1>
<p>Hypericum canariense var. triphyllum, commonly known as the Canary Islands St. John's Wort, is a rare and endemic plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is a shrub characterized by its yellow flowers and medicinal properties, though it is less commonly used in modern herbal medicine compared to other Hypericum species. The plant has three leaflets, which is reflected in its scientific name "triphyllum," meaning "three-leaved.". It thrives in coastal and rocky environments, often found in dry, sunny areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
