                    <h1>Heteromorpha arborescens var. trifoliata</h1>
<p>Heteromorpha arborescens var. trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three distinct lobes, which is a key identifying characteristic.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
