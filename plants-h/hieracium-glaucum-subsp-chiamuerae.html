<p>Hieracium glaucum subsp.</p>
<p>chiamuerae, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellowish to orange flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes, where it tolerates cold and poor soil conditions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller flower heads and more compact growth form compared to other members of the Hieracium genus.</p>
