<p>Halothamnus subaphyllus subsp.</p>
<p>psammophilus, commonly known as the sand-plant or desert sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it conserve moisture in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers during the spring and summer months, adapting to the limited growing season in its habitat. Its leaves are typically short and succulent, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well-suited to sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and inland deserts.</p>
