                    <h1>Hypechusa lutea var. amphiantha</h1>
<p>Hypechusa lutea var. amphiantha, commonly known as the yellow false nettle, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettles and related species. The plant is characterized by its slender stems, opposite leaves with serrated edges, and small yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>The species is often mistaken for true nettles due to its similar appearance, but it lacks the stinging hairs found on most Urticaceae plants.</p>
