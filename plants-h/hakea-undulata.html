<p>Hakea undulata, commonly known as the undulating hakea, is a shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces striking, pendulous inflorescences of bright yellow flowers that bloom during the autumn and winter months. Its seeds are enclosed in woody, cylindrical pods that split open to release the seeds when mature.</p>
<p>Hakea undulata is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments.</p>
