<p>Heracleum macranthum, commonly known as giant hogweed, is a tall biennial or perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features large, umbrella-like compound leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, and it produces clusters of small, white flowers in umbels. The plant contains phototoxic sap that can cause severe skin irritation when exposed to sunlight. It is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as riverbanks and roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions.</p>
