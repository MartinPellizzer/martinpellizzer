                            <h1>Hieracium Levicaule Subsp. Viridiceps</h1>
<p>Hieracium levicaule subsp. viridiceps is a lesser-known member of the dandelion family known for its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers. This subspecies is often found in moist, shaded areas across northern Europe and parts of Asia. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving it a unique appearance. Despite its modest size, it plays an important role in local ecosystems by supporting pollinators. Researchers continue to study its genetic makeup to better understand its ecological significance.</p>
