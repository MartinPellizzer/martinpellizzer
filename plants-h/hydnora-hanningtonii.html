                    <h1>Hydnora hanningtonii</h1>
<p>Hydnora hanningtonii, commonly known as the African starwort, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Africa and typically grows on the roots of woody plants such as Euphorbias. The plant produces a distinctive, fleshy, reddish structure that resembles a star, which is designed to attract pollinators. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female parts, and it relies on insects for pollination.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and parasitic lifestyle, it is considered a rare and fascinating example of botanical adaptation.</p>
