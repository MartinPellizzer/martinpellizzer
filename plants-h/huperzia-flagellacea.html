<p>Huperzia flagellacea, commonly known as the flagellate huperzia, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often pendulous fronds that resemble whip-like structures, hence its common name. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its sporophytes produce spores on the underside of the fronds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Huperzia flagellacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its unique foliage.</p>
