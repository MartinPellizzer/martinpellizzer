                            <h1>Holcus Mollis Var. Densus</h1>
<p>Dense hairgrass, scientifically known as Holcus mollis var. densus, is a low-growing grass species commonly found in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its thick, tufted growth and dense, fine-textured foliage that creates a soft, carpet-like appearance. This variety is particularly valued for its ability to thrive in compacted soils and its resilience to foot traffic. Often used in landscaping and erosion control, it adds a natural aesthetic to gardens and wildflower meadows. Its unique structure and adaptability make it a popular choice for both ornamental and ecological applications.</p>
