<p>Haronga ovata, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It features large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant produces showy, white or pink flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its roots anchor it in shallow water, while its rhizomes spread across the substrate.</p>
<p>Haronga ovata plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water bodies.</p>
