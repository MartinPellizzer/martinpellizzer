                    <h1>Hiraea quapara var. glabrata</h1>
<p>Hiraea quapara var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth hiraea, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology and flowering structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a range of colors from yellow to orange, and it produces seeds through a unique dispersal mechanism.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, this variant remains poorly understood in botanical research.</p>
