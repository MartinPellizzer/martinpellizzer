                    <h1>Hibiscus tiliaceus var. potteri</h1>
<p>Hibiscus tiliaceus var. potteri, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spreading, often prostrate growth habit, with thick, fleshy stems that are adapted to salt spray and sandy soils. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the flowers are showy, with five petals and a prominent central column. It produces orange or yellow fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by water or wind.</p>
<p>This species is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize shorelines and tolerate harsh maritime conditions.</p>
