                    <h1>Hymenophyllum ricciifolium</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum ricciifolium, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, velvety fronds covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes, which give it a soft, moss-like appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a thin, membranous covering.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in tropical gardens.</p>
