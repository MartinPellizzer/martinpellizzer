                    <h1>Hulthemia berberifolia</h1>
<p>Hulthemia berberifolia, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically features a dense rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Hulthemia berberifolia is adapted to cold climates and is an important component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
