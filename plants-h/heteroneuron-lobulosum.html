<p>Heteroneuron lobulosum, commonly known as the lobed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic invertebrates. The plant typically grows in freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches, where it can thrive in moist, nutrient-poor conditions. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, while the stems are often branched and floating.</p>
<p>The reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, with flowers that are typically pale green or white.</p>
