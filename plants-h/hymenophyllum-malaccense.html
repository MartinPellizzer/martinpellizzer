<p>Hymenophyllum malaccense, commonly known as the Malacca fern, is a species of filmy fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and ecological preferences make it an important component of understory vegetation in rainforest ecosystems.</p>
