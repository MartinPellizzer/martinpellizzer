                    <h1>Hypogynium</h1>
<p>Hypogynium, commonly known as the basal part of the pistil in flowering plants, is a critical structure located at the base of the ovary.</p>
<p>It serves as the attachment point for the stigma and style, playing a vital role in pollination and fertilization processes. The hypogynium is often modified to form structures such as the nectary or a receptacle, which can influence pollinator attraction. Its morphology varies among plant species and is often studied in taxonomy and evolutionary botany.</p>
<p>Understanding the hypogynium helps in identifying and classifying flowering plants based on their reproductive structures.</p>
