                    <h1>Hymenophyllum abruptum var. brevifrons</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum abruptum var. brevifrons, commonly known as the narrow-fruited shield fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leathery, and often hairy fronds, which are typically dark green and have a distinctive, shield-like appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in montane forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its unique morphology and ecological adaptation to its native habitat.</p>
