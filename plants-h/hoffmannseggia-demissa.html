                    <h1>Hoffmannseggia demissa</h1>
<p>Hoffmannseggia demissa, commonly known as the Mexican rock cactus, is a perennial succulent native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branching structure with fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring or early summer, adding a vibrant touch to its desert habitat. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, a characteristic adaptation to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Hoffmannseggia demissa is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
