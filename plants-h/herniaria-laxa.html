                    <h1>Herniaria laxa</h1>
<p>Herniaria laxa, commonly known as the common sand-stop, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to sandy coastal areas of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It has small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in dunes or coastal grasslands.</p>
<p>Its unique ability to stabilize sand dunes makes it an ecologically important species in coastal ecosystems.</p>
