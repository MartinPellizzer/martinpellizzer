                    <h1>Humboltia diptera</h1>
<p>Humboltia diptera, commonly known as the desert holly, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry conditions. Its leaves are thick and waxy, reducing water loss and enabling it to thrive in low-water environments.</p>
<p>Humboltia diptera plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
