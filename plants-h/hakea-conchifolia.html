                    <h1>Hakea conchifolia</h1>
<p>Hakea conchifolia, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, needle-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers, which are clustered in cylindrical spikes and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its fibrous, woody fruits contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural spread.</p>
<p>Hakea conchifolia is often found in coastal heathlands and sand dunes, where it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
