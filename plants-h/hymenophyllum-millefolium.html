                    <h1>Hymenophyllum millefolium</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum millefolium, commonly known as the silver fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance, and its leaves are covered in a dense layer of tiny, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum millefolium is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses.</p>
