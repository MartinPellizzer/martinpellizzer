                    <h1>Huperzia europaea</h1>
<p>Huperzia europaea, commonly known as the European huperzia, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the leaves, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
