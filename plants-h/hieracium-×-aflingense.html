<p>Hieracium × aflingense, commonly known as the Afling meadow hawkweed, is a hybrid plant belonging to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers and hairy stems, typical of many hawkweed species. The plant typically grows in meadows and grassy areas, preferring well-drained soils. It is native to Central Europe and has been introduced to other regions as an ornamental or invasive species.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits variability in morphology and can be challenging to distinguish from closely related species.</p>
