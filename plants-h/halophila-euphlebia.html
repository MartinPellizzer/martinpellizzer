                    <h1>Halophila euphlebia</h1>
<p>Halophila euphlebia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved seagrass, is a marine flowering plant belonging to the Alismataceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical coastal regions, particularly in the Indo-Pacific, where it thrives in shallow, sandy seabeds. The plant has long, ribbon-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water resistance and facilitate photosynthesis in underwater environments. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically found in clusters and are pollinated by water currents.</p>
<p>Halophila euphlebia plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for various marine organisms.</p>
