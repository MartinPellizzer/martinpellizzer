<p>Heracleum laciniatum, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a tall, biennial or perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, umbrella-like compound leaves and showy, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant contains phototoxic sap, which can cause severe skin irritation when exposed to sunlight. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils along riverbanks and roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions.</p>
