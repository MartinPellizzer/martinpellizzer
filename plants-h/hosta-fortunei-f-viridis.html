                    <h1>Hosta fortunei f. viridis</h1>
<p>Hosta fortunei f. viridis, commonly known as the Emerald Queen hosta, is a compact, hardy perennial that features broad, waxy, dark green leaves with a striking metallic sheen.</p>
<p>This variegated form exhibits solid green foliage without the typical yellow or white markings found in other hosta varieties. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil rich in organic matter. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers on slender stems in late summer.</p>
<p>Its dense foliage makes it an excellent choice for ground cover or as a focal point in shaded garden settings.</p>
