                    <h1>Hornera lignosa</h1>
<p>Hornera lignosa, commonly known as the hardwood hornera, is a woody shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and small, pale green leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its hard, heavy wood is highly valued for carving and construction due to its durability and fine grain.</p>
<p>Hornera lignosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
