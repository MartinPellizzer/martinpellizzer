                    <h1>Hylebates</h1>
<p>Hylebates, commonly known as the red-eyed treefrog, is a tropical plant?.</p>
<p>No, it is actually an amphibian. The user may have confused the name with a plant.</p>
<p>Hylebates is not a botanical term for any plant species. Therefore, I cannot provide information on the botanical aspects of Hylebates as it refers to an animal, not a plant.</p>
<p>I can't reply.</p>
