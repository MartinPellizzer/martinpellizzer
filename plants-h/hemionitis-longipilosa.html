                    <h1>Hemionitis longipilosa</h1>
<p>Hemionitis longipilosa, commonly known as the long-hair fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a soft, lace-like appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
