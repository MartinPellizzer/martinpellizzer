                    <h1>Hemionitis dealbata</h1>
<p>Hemionitis dealbata, commonly known as the white hemionitis, is a rare and delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, pale green fronds that are often covered in a waxy, whitish bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in shaded, rocky habitats. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemionitis dealbata is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
