<p>Hieracium lancifrons, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that give it its specific epithet. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer, producing numerous seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Hieracium lancifrons is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit.</p>
