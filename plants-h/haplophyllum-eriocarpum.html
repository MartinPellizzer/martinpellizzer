<p>Haplophyllum eriocarpum, commonly known as the woolly bladderpod, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, and its fruit is a dry, segmented pod that splits open to release seeds.
