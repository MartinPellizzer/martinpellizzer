                    <h1>Hahnia</h1>
<p>Hahnia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, often fragrant, umbel-shaped inflorescences that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plants typically have finely divided, fern-like leaves and are often found in moist, shaded environments. Hahnia species are native to various regions in the Americas, particularly in the eastern United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators.</p>
