<p>Haplopappus litoralis, commonly known as the seaside hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in salty, windy environments.</p>
<p>Haplopappus litoralis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
