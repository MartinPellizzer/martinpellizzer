                            <h1>Hieracium Tenericeps</h1>
<p>Hieracium tenericeps, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies, sunflowers, and other similar plants. This species is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. It often thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed.</p>
