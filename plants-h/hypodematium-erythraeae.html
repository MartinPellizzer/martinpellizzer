                    <h1>Hypodematium erythraeae</h1>
<p>Hypodematium erythraeae, commonly known as the red lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, temperate environments.</p>
<p>It forms a dense, crust-like growth on tree bark, rocks, and soil surfaces, often in shaded forest areas. The plant's thallus is composed of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to absorb nutrients from the environment. Its vibrant reddish color comes from pigments produced by the algal component.</p>
<p>Hypodematium erythraeae plays a crucial role in soil stabilization and serves as a bioindicator of air quality.</p>
