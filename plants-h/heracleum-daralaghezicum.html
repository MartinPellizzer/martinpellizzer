<p>Heracleum daralaghezicum, commonly known as the Daralaghezic hogweed, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, compound leaves.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, temperate regions and is known for its umbellate inflorescence, which consists of small white or greenish flowers. The plant produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps, which are dispersed by wind. It is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and other disturbed sites, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its potential toxicity, caution is advised when handling or consuming any part of the plant.</p>
