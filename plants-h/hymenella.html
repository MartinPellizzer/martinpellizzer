                    <h1>Hymenella</h1>
<p>Hymenella, commonly known as the fairy ring mushroom, is a genus of fungi belonging to the family Tricholomataceae.</p>
<p>These fungi are typically found in temperate regions and are known for forming circular, often ephemeral growths called fairy rings. The fruiting bodies of Hymenella species are usually small, with a cap that ranges from white to brown in color. They have gills that are initially pale but may darken with age, and the spores are produced on the hymenium, a layer of tissue beneath the cap.</p>
<p>Hymenella mushrooms are generally considered edible but should be approached with caution due to their similarity to poisonous species.</p>
