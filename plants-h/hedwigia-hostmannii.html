<p>Hedwigia hostmannii, commonly known as the desert feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, needle-like leaves that form dense, tufted clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Hedwigia hostmannii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
