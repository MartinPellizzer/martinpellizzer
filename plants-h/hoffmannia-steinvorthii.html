                    <h1>Hoffmannia steinvorthii</h1>
<p>Hoffmannia steinvorthii, commonly known as the desert hoffmannia, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry soils.</p>
<p>Hoffmannia steinvorthii is adapted to extreme temperatures and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
