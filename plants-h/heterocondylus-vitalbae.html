                    <h1>Heterocondylus vitalbae</h1>
<p>Heterocondylus vitalbae, commonly known as the sheep's bread lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It forms a dense, greenish-gray crust on tree trunks and branches, often found in temperate regions. The thallus is composed of a symbiotic partnership between a photosynthetic algae and a fungal mycelium. It lacks distinct lobes but has a uniform, leathery texture.</p>
<p>This lichen is an important indicator of air quality and ecological health in forest ecosystems.</p>
