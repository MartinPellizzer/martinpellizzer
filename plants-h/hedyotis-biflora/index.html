                            <h1>Hedyotis Biflora</h1>
<p>Hedyotis biflora is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is known for its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique appearance and medicinal properties have made it a subject of interest in both botanical and pharmacological studies. Despite its beauty, Hedyotis biflora remains relatively obscure in the broader horticultural world.</p>
