<p>Hylotelephium malacophyllum subsp.</p>
<p>lioutchenngoi, commonly known as the Tibetan stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to high-altitude regions of China. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine meadows. It produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or red, which bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil and full sun.</p>
