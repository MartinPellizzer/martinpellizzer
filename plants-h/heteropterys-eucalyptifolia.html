                    <h1>Heteropterys eucalyptifolia</h1>
<p>Heteropterys eucalyptifolia, commonly known as the eucalyptus-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Lauraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly in countries like Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that resemble those of eucalyptus trees, hence its common name. It attaches itself to host trees through its haustellum, drawing water and nutrients from the host.</p>
<p>Its flowers are typically white or pale green and are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
