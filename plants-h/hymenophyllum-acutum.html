                    <h1>Hymenophyllum acutum</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum acutum, commonly known as the acute hymenophyllum, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, linear fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called soruses, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and habitat preferences make it a notable example of epiphytic and lithophytic growth in humid ecosystems.</p>
