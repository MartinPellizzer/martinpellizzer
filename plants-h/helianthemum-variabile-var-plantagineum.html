<p>Helianthemum variabile var. plantagineum, commonly known as the variable rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and coastal gardens.</p>
