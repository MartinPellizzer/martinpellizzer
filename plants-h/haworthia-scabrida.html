<p>Haworthia scabrida, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, evergreen succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves covered in white to grayish tubercles that give it a distinctive zebra-like appearance. The leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted for storing water in its arid native environment. It produces small, white or pale green flowers on tall, slender stalks during the summer months.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rock gardens or indoor cultivation.</p>
