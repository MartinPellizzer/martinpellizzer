                    <h1>Heliamphora neblinae var. parva</h1>
<p>Heliamphora neblinae var. parva, commonly known as the dwarf marsh pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the tepuis of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete digestive enzymes to trap and digest insects. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires high humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Its compact size makes it well-suited for cultivation in small containers.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is a popular choice among carnivorous plant enthusiasts.</p>
