<p>Haplopappus foliosus subsp.</p>
<p>meyenii, commonly known as the desert pappus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous root system.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The small, yellowish flowers bloom in the spring and are followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
