<p>Hirtella triandra subsp.</p>
<p>media, commonly known as the Brazilian peppertree, is a shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals. It is adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both wet and dry conditions.</p>
<p>However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
