<p>Helianthemum marifolium subsp.</p>
<p>conquense, commonly known as the Canary Islands rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>The plant has woody stems and dense, evergreen foliage that is adapted to the arid, rocky environments of its habitat. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in Mediterranean gardens.</p>
