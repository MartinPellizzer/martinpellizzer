<p>Holosteum umbellatum f. glaberrimum, commonly known as the smooth-holosteum, is a rare and striking plant characterized by its unique floral structure.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic and edible plants, and is native to specific regions in Europe. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves and produces umbel-like inflorescences with small, white to pale yellow flowers. Its smooth, hairless appearance in this form distinguishes it from other varieties of Holosteum.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
