<p>Hydrobryum kaengsophense, commonly known as the Thai marsh fern, is a rare aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetland environments and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds. The plant has a complex rhizome system that helps it anchor in muddy or sandy substrates. Its spores are dispersed by water currents, aiding in its propagation.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
