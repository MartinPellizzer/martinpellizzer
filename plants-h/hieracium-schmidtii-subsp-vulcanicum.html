<p>Hieracium schmidtii subsp.</p>
<p>vulcanicum, commonly known as the volcanic hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the volcanic regions of central and eastern Europe. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, often on nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>The plant features a basal rosette of leaves with a hairy texture, and its flowering stems bear yellow composite flowers arranged in a single head. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and is adapted to thrive in harsh, volcanic environments.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and localized species.</p>
