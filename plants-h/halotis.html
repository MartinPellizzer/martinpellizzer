                    <h1>Halotis</h1>
<p>Halotis, commonly known as the saltbush, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Amaranthaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically shrubs or subshrubs, characterized by their succulent leaves and ability to thrive in saline or arid environments. Halotis species are often found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline soils where they play a crucial role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. Their leaves contain high concentrations of salt, which helps them tolerate high-salinity conditions.</p>
<p>The flowers are usually small and clustered, with colors ranging from white to pink, attracting various pollinators.</p>
