                    <h1>Homolepis longiflora</h1>
<p>Homolepis longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered homolepis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and marshes of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, slender flowering stems that bear clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The flowers are typically arranged in dense, terminal spikes and bloom in late summer to early fall. The plant is adapted to moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in swampy areas along rivers and lakes.</p>
<p>It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying wetland ecosystems.</p>
