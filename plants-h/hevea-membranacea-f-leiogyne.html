                    <h1>Hevea membranacea f. leiogyne</h1>
<p>Hevea membranacea f. leiogyne, commonly known as the smooth-leaved rubber tree, is a variant of the rubber tree species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, waxy leaves that are typically narrower and more elongated compared to the standard species. The plant is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with a dense canopy and can grow up to 15 meters in height under optimal conditions. Its latex, similar to that of Hevea brasiliensis, has been historically used for rubber production.</p>
<p>However, it is less commercially significant due to lower latex yield and specific environmental requirements.</p>
