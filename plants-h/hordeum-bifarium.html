<p>Hordeum bifarium, commonly known as two-row barley, is a species of grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of two rows of grains along the stem, which distinguishes it from other barley varieties. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in clusters, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Hordeum bifarium is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional agriculture and as a forage crop.</p>
