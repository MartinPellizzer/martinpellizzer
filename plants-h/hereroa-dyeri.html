                    <h1>Hereroa dyeri</h1>
<p>Hereroa dyeri, commonly known as the Namib Desert lichen, is a unique symbiotic organism composed of a green alga and a fungus.</p>
<p>It thrives in the extreme arid conditions of the Namib Desert, relying on fog for moisture. The plant forms a crust-like structure on rock surfaces, which helps it retain water and protect against harsh environmental conditions. Its photosynthetic algal partner provides energy, while the fungal component offers structural support and nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>This adaptation allows Hereroa dyeri to survive in one of the most hostile environments on Earth.</p>
