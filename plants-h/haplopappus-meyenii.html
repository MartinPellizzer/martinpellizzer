<p>Haplopappus meyenii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming habit with hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Haplopappus meyenii is adapted to survive in sandy or rocky soils with minimal water availability.</p>
