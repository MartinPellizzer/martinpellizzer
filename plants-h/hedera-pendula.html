<p>Hedera pendula, commonly known as the weeping ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features long, arching stems that hang gracefully, producing clusters of small, dark green leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in late summer, followed by dark blue berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Hedera pendula is also valued for its ability to climb walls and trellises, making it a popular choice for vertical gardening.</p>
