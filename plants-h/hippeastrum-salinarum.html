                    <h1>Hippeastrum salinarum</h1>
<p>Hippeastrum salinarum, commonly known as the Salina amaryllis, is a species native to the coastal regions of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces large, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. Hippeastrum salinarum thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations make it well-suited for coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds.</p>
