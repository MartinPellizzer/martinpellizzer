                    <h1>Hiraea cycloptera</h1>
<p>Hiraea cycloptera, commonly known as the spiral liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Ptilidiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its flattened, ribbon-like thallus that often forms dense mats on moist, shaded soil or rock surfaces. The plant exhibits a distinctive spiral arrangement of its lobes, which is a key identifying feature. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead relies on rhizoids for anchoring and nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Hiraea cycloptera thrives in humid environments and is often found in temperate regions with high moisture levels.</p>
