<p>Hippuris polyphylla, commonly known as the broad-leaved water-plantain, is a semi-aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often floating or partially submerged, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in spikes, appearing in early summer.</p>
<p>Hippuris polyphylla plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians.</p>
