                    <h1>Halocnemum cruciatum</h1>
<p>Halocnemum cruciatum, commonly known as sea blite, is a halophytic plant adapted to thrive in saline environments.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with succulent, fleshy leaves that help store water in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a cross shape, which is characteristic of the Caryophyllaceae family. It is often found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline soils across Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate high salt concentrations makes it an important component of salt-tolerant ecosystems.</p>
