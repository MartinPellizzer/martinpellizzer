                    <h1>Habenaria arianae</h1>
<p>Habenaria arianae, commonly known as the Arabian marsh orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the arid regions of the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale green to white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant typically grows in wetlands and marshy areas, where it relies on specific soil conditions and seasonal water availability. Its flowering period is short, and it is often difficult to spot due to its inconspicuous appearance.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Habenaria arianae is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
