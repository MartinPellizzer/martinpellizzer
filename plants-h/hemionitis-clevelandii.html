                    <h1>Hemionitis clevelandii</h1>
<p>Hemionitis clevelandii, commonly known as the Cleveland's hemionitis, is a rare and unique plant species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a small, mat-forming perennial that thrives in rocky, well-drained soils, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has distinctive, narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in early spring, and it reproduces through rhizomes rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
