<p>Hieracium nidense, commonly known as the nest hawksbeard, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves and produces yellow composite flowers with ray florets. It has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Hieracium nidense is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil stabilization.</p>
