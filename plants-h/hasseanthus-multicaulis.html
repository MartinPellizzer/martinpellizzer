<p>Hasseanthus multicaulis, commonly known as the purple sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub with slender, branched stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular, violet-blue flowers that bloom in spring and summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Hasseanthus multicaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
