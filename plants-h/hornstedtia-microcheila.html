<p>It is characterized by its small, grass-like leaves and inconspicuous, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is typically found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Its botanical study contributes to the understanding of plant adaptations in high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
