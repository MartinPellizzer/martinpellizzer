                    <h1>Hubertia olivacea</h1>
<p>Hubertia olivacea, commonly known as the olive-leaved hubertia, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features striking, waxy, olive-green leaves that are often ribbed and have a distinctive, almost sculptural appearance. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers in summer, which bloom from the leaf axils. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
