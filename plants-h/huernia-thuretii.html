<p>Huernia thuretii, commonly known as the horned hawse, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>

The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems and leaves.</p>
<p>Huernia thuretii is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal.</p>
