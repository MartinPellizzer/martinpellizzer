                    <h1>Hippion aphyllum</h1>
<p>Hippion aphyllum, commonly known as the leafless thistle, is a unique plant species characterized by its lack of leaves and its spiny, globe-shaped structure.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is native to arid regions of southern Africa. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Despite its lack of foliage, it is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its thick, waxy coating and deep root system.</p>
<p>Its distinctive appearance and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
