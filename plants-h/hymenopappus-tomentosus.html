                    <h1>Hymenopappus tomentosus</h1>
<p>Hymenopappus tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly sunflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features hairy, gray-green foliage and produces yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a taproot system and is adapted to arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small florets surrounded by bracts, and it is often found in rocky soils and open plains.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its soft, woolly appearance, which helps reduce water loss and protect against herbivory.</p>
