                    <h1>Hordeum secalinum var. parviflorum</h1>
<p>Hordeum secalinum var. parviflorum, commonly known as dwarf barley, is a wild grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, pale green leaves. The plant produces tiny, clustered spikelets with short, narrow florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed but also has potential uses in ecological restoration projects.</p>
