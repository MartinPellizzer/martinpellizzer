<p>Hypolepis rugosula subsp.</p>
<p>rouxii, commonly known as the rugged shield fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a rough, textured surface.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat.</p>
