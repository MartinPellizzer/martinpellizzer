                    <h1>Hedera palmata</h1>
<p>Hedera palmata, commonly known as the palmate ivy, is a climbing vine native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which give it a distinctive, almost palm-like appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a useful ground cover and a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
<p>Hedera palmata produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by dark blue berries that are attractive to birds.</p>
