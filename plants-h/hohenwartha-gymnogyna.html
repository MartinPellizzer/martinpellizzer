                    <h1>Hohenwartha gymnogyna</h1>
<p>Hohenwartha gymnogyna, commonly known as the naked-stemmed hohenwartha, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often leafless stems that rise directly from the ground. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom during the warmer months. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists studying adaptation to high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
