The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by fluffy, white to grayish pappus structures that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well adapted to drought conditions and contribute to its ecological role in native plant communities.</p>
