<p>Hapalochilus warianus, commonly known as the Warianus rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, often fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, yellow, or green. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in forest undergrowth. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding substrate, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, this species is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect its natural ecosystems.</p>
