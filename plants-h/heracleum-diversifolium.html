                    <h1>Heracleum diversifolium</h1>
<p>Heracleum diversifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved cow parsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist meadows and woodland edges. The plant features large, pinnately compound leaves that vary in shape, giving it its specific epithet "diversifolium.". Its flowers are white or pale yellow, arranged in flat-topped clusters, and it produces small, hairy fruits.</p>
<p>It is often mistaken for other similar species due to its resemblance to wild carrots or parsley.</p>
