<p>Hypericum graveolens, commonly known as stinking hypericum, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are typically oval with a slightly hairy texture. The plant contains hypericin and pseudohypericin, which are responsible for its medicinal properties and also contribute to its distinctive reddish-brown staining of the skin. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in woodland edges and grassy areas.</p>
<p>Due to its chemical composition, it has been used historically in herbal medicine for its purported antidepressant and antiseptic effects.</p>
