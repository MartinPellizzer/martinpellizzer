                    <h1>Haloschoenus</h1>
<p>Haloschoenus, commonly known as the salt marsh grass, is a genus of flowering plants native to coastal regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ability to thrive in saline and brackish environments, making it an important component of salt marsh ecosystems. The plants typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, spike-like inflorescences. Haloschoenus species are often found in tidal zones, where they help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Their ecological importance lies in their role in supporting biodiversity and maintaining the health of coastal habitats.</p>
