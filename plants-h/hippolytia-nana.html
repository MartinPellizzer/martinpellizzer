                    <h1>Hippolytia nana</h1>
<p>Hippolytia nana, commonly known as the dwarf hippolytia, is a small, mat-forming succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features compact, hairy stems that produce clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant is adapted to arid conditions, with thick, fleshy leaves that store water. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and limited natural range, it is often cultivated in controlled environments.</p>
