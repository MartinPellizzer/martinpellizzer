<p>Hieracium caesium subsp.</p>
<p>osiliae, commonly known as the Osilian hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate leaves and yellow flower heads composed of numerous small florets.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It is distinguished by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in parts of its range.</p>
