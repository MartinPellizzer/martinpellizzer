                    <h1>Holosteum repens</h1>
<p>Holosteum repens, commonly known as the creeping holosteum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, spreading stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that help it thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its fruit is a dry, two-lobed schizocarp that splits into two one-seeded units upon maturity.</p>
<p>Holosteum repens is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and other damp habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
