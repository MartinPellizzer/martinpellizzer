                    <h1>Harrisia nashii var. straminea</h1>
<p>Harrisia nashii var. straminea, commonly known as the yellow-hairless cactus, is a species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive yellowish-green stem and lacks the typical spines found in many cacti. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its foliage. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, typical of many cacti in the Cactaceae family.</p>
<p>This variety is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in arid gardens.</p>
