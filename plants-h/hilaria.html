                    <h1>Hilaria</h1>
<p>Hilaria, commonly known as the "blue grass" or "dwarf bluegrass," is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of about 20 species, most of which are native to the Americas, particularly the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. These plants are typically low-growing, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered blue or purple flowers. Hilaria species are often found in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, drought-tolerant ground covers.</p>
