<p>Hedysarum algidum var. algidum, commonly known as the alpine sweetvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with small, heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments.</p>
<p>Hedysarum algidum var. algidum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen and stabilize soil in harsh conditions.</p>
