<p>Heliotropium nubicum, commonly known as the cloud heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of up to 30 centimeters, with slender, branching stems covered in fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale purple to pink flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday, a characteristic known as nyctinasty. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a slightly hairy texture.</p>
<p>Heliotropium nubicum is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
