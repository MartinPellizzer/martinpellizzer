                    <h1>Heracleum candicans var. obtusifolium</h1>
<p>Heracleum candicans var. obtusifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved cow parsnip, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with a hairy underside.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels, which bloom in late summer. Its stems are hollow and covered in fine hairs, and the roots are thick and fleshy, resembling those of a parsnip. It is native to North America and thrives in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
