                    <h1>Haplophyllum crenulatum</h1>
<p>Haplophyllum crenulatum, commonly known as the crested rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in spring. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Haplophyllum crenulatum is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value.</p>
