<p>Henriettea trachyphylla, commonly known as the rough-leaved henriettea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming during the cooler months. Henriettea trachyphylla is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in full sun.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations make it an important species in its ecological niche.</p>
