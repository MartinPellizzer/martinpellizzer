<p>Hedysarum hedysaroides subsp.</p>
<p>exaltatum, commonly known as the tall vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three small, oval-shaped leaflets.</p>
<p>The plant produces erect, sparsely branched racemes of yellowish to reddish flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
