<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, butterfly-like flowers that are typically pale pink to white in color. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its tropical rainforest habitat. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the humid, shaded environments where it grows.</p>
<p>The species is also noted for its fragrant blooms, which attract specific pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
