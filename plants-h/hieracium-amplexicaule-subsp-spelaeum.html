<p>Hieracium amplexicaule subsp.</p>
<p>spelaeum, commonly known as the cave groundsel, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to subterranean environments. It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the dim light of cave systems.</p>
<p>This subspecies thrives in moist, shaded conditions, often found in limestone caves and rock shelters. Its morphology reflects evolutionary adaptations to low-light conditions, with reduced leaf size and elongated stems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
