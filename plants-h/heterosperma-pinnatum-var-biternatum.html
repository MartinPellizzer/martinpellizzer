<p>Heterosperma pinnatum var. biternatum, commonly known as the three-parted water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Heterosperma.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnate leaves that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it can anchor itself to substrates. Its leaves are often submerged, with some emergent portions that can be used for identification.</p>
<p>The species is noted for its adaptability to varying water conditions and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
