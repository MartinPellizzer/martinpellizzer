                    <h1>Hydrocotyle pinnatifida</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water shield, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It has floating leaves that are typically divided into narrow, thread-like segments, giving it a delicate appearance. The plant thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Its small white flowers bloom in late summer, and it produces small, round fruits that float on the water's surface.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle pinnatifida plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
