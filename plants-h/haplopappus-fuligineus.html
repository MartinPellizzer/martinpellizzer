                    <h1>Haplopappus fuligineus</h1>
<p>Haplopappus fuligineus, commonly known as the sooty pappus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant has a low, spreading growth habit with gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically pale yellow to brown, and the plant produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Haplopappus fuligineus is adapted to survive in extreme conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
