                    <h1>Humiriastrum cuspidatum</h1>
<p>Humiriastrum cuspidatum, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, ribbed stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments, allowing it to survive in dry, rocky soils. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores.</p>
<p>The plant is also known for its ability to produce edible fruits, though they are typically consumed by wildlife rather than humans.</p>
