<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its fronds are delicate and feather-like, with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems.</p>
