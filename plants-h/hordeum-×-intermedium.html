                    <h1>Hordeum × intermedium</h1>
<p>Hordeum × intermedium, commonly known as intermediate barley, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between barley (Hordeum vulgare) and wild barley (Hordeum spontaneum).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intermediate morphology, combining traits from both parent species, such as growth habit and grain structure. This plant is typically found in temperate regions and thrives in a variety of soil types, showing some degree of adaptability. Its botanical features include slender stalks, spikelet clusters, and seeds that range in color from pale yellow to brown.</p>
<p>Hordeum × intermedium is of interest to researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and its role in agricultural breeding programs.</p>
