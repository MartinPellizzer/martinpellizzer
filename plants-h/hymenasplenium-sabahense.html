                    <h1>Hymenasplenium sabahense</h1>
<p>Hymenasplenium sabahense, commonly known as the Sabah spleenwort, is a rare and endangered fern species native to the Bornean rainforests.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae, characterized by its delicate, moss-like appearance and preference for humid, shaded environments. The plant typically grows on rock surfaces or tree trunks, forming dense, carpet-like colonies. Its leaves are small, closely spaced, and have a velvety texture, which helps retain moisture in its tropical habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a critically important species for conservation efforts in Southeast Asia.</p>
