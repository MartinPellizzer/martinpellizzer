                    <h1>Hornungia circinnata</h1>
<p>Hornungia circinnata, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine and subalpine regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of wiry, branching stems covered in small, rounded leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves and stems are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Hornungia circinnata is adapted to rocky soils and high elevations, making it a characteristic component of alpine flora.</p>
