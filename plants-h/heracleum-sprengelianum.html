<p>Heracleum sprengelianum, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a tall, herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe.</p>
<p>It features large, umbrella-like compound leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, with a distinctive hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in umbels, which are characteristic of the Apiaceae family. Its stem is thick, hollow, and covered in coarse hairs, often with a reddish tint.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it is considered a noxious weed and can pose a danger to humans if skin contact occurs.</p>
