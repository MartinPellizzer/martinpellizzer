The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are hairy and lance-shaped, with a central stem bearing yellow composite flowers. It is characterized by its ability to spread through rhizomes, forming dense colonies in its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is often found in mountainous areas with limited soil nutrients.</p>
