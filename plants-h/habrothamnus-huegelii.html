                    <h1>Habrothamnus huegelii</h1>
<p>Habrothamnus huegelii, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to the alpine regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features dense, compact growth with small, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white bloom, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates.</p>
<p>Due to its unique structure and habitat, it is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
