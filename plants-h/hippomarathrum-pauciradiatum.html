                    <h1>Hippomarathrum pauciradiatum</h1>
<p>Hippomarathrum pauciradiatum, commonly known as the sparse-rayed milkweed, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes many milkweed species known for their milky sap. The plant is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a hairy texture, and it thrives in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Hippomarathrum pauciradiatum plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though it is not as well-known as other milkweed species.</p>
