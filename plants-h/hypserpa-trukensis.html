<p>Hypserpa trukensis, commonly known as the Truk Islands cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
