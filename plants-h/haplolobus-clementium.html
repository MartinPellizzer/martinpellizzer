                    <h1>Haplolobus clementium</h1>
<p>Haplolobus clementium, commonly known as the Clementium lichen, is a unique species belonging to the family Lecanoraceae.</p>
<p>It is a foliose lichen that forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungal partner and a green alga or cyanobacterium. The thallus is typically pale green to yellowish in color, with a distinctive lobed structure that gives it a leaf-like appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on bark or soil surfaces in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of environmental health.</p>
