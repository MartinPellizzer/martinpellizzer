                    <h1>Haageocereus horrens var. sphaerocarpus</h1>
<p>Haageocereus horrens var. sphaerocarpus, commonly known as the globular cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, spherical shape and is covered in dense, white spines that provide protection from herbivores and excessive sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny exterior. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for desert environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in cactus gardens.</p>
