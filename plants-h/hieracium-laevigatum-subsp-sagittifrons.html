<p>Hieracium laevigatum subsp.</p>
<p>sagittifrons, commonly known as the arrowhead hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of leaves that are broadly ovate to lanceolate in shape, often with a waxy coating.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in a single terminal head, which are surrounded by a series of involucral bracts. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and is characterized by its hairy stems and finely divided leaves.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often mistaken for other hawkweed species due to its similar appearance but can be distinguished by its specific leaf morphology and flower structure.</p>
