                    <h1>Hydrophyllum tenuipes var. viride</h1>
<p>Hydrophyllum tenuipes var. viride, commonly known as greenleaf false nettle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely toothed, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a bright green color. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are often subtended by leaf-like bracts. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its wetland habitat, with rhizomes that help it spread and survive in saturated soils.</p>
