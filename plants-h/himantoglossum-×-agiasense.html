<p>Himantoglossum × agiasense, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid between Himantoglossum haematochlaena and Himantoglossum × hirsutum, exhibiting a combination of characteristics from both parent species. The plant produces showy, lip-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, which are adapted for specific pollinators. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland edges and meadows.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
