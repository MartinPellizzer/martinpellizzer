                    <h1>Hirculus gatogombensis</h1>
<p>Hirculus gatogombensis, commonly known as the Gato Gombé goat plant, is a rare and endemic species found in the high-altitude regions of the Gato Gombé Mountains.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and clustered, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to the cool, moist climate of its native habitat. Its flowers are small, white, and fragrant, typically blooming in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires partial shade to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hirculus gatogombensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
