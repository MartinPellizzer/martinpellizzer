                    <h1>Habenaria caffra</h1>
<p>Habenaria caffra, commonly known as the African marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and forest understories. The plant produces tall, slender stems with lance-shaped leaves and clusters of pale green to white flowers. Its roots are often symbiotic with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The orchid's structure and growth habits reflect its adaptation to humid, nutrient-poor habitats.</p>
