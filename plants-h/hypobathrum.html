                    <h1>Hypobathrum</h1>
<p>Hypobathrum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with elongated, pale green leaves and a single, showy white or pale pink flower. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Hypobathrum thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and conservation efforts are essential for its survival.</p>
