<p>Hemionitis callifolia, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of fine hairs on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss and protect against herbivory. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems rise to the surface.</p>
<p>Hemionitis callifolia is known for its ability to produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects.</p>
