                    <h1>Hippotis panamensis</h1>
<p>Hippotis panamensis, commonly known as the Panamanian bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its submerged, branching stems and small, green leaves. The plant is notable for its ability to trap small aquatic organisms, functioning as a carnivorous plant. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor waters by supplementing its diet with captured prey.</p>
