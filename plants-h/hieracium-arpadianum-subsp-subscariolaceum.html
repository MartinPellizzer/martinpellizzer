<p>Hieracium arpadianum subsp.</p>
<p>subscariolaceum, commonly known as the Carpathian hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in the summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist meadows and forest edges, preferring well-drained soils. Its subspecies status is due to subtle differences in leaf morphology and habitat preference compared to other Hieracium species.</p>
<p>It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to plant biodiversity.</p>
