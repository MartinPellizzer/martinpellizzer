<p>Hordeum pusillum var. typicum, commonly known as dwarf barley, is a small annual grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of less than 30 centimeters, with slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, two-lobed spikelets. Its seeds are encased in a hard pericarp, which aids in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Hordeum pusillum var. typicum is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
