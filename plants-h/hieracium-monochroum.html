<p>Hieracium monochroum, commonly known as the single-stem hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by seed heads that disperse via the wind.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a potential weed in some regions.</p>
