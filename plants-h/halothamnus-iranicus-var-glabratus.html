<p>Halothamnus iranicus var. glabratus, commonly known as the smooth halothamnus, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, often hairy stems and leaves. The plant is well adapted to dry, rocky environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters and are typically pollinated by wind.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ability to store water in its fleshy leaves, making it a resilient plant in harsh climates.</p>
