                    <h1>Hemionitis niphobola</h1>
<p>Hemionitis niphobola, commonly known as the snow fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to high-altitude regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and possesses a unique ability to survive in cold, arid environments. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its growth is slow, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and ecological fragility, Hemionitis niphobola is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
