<p>Hieracium laevigatum subsp.</p>
<p>vogesicola, commonly known as the Voges alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Europe. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, thriving in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in open habitats such as meadows and mountain slopes.</p>
