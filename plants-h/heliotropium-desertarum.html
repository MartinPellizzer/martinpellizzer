                    <h1>Heliotropium desertarum</h1>
<p>Heliotropium desertarum, commonly known as the desert heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub with hairy, succulent stems that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from purple to pink, often appearing in the early morning. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Heliotropium desertarum is adapted to thrive in hot, dry conditions and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats.</p>
