<p>Heracleum ponticum, commonly known as the Caucasian cowparsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences.</p>
<p>It is a biennial or perennial herb that can grow up to 2 meters tall, with hollow, ridged stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters, which are followed by small, dry fruits. It is native to the Caucasus region and is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed.</p>
