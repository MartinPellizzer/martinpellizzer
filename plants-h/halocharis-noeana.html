                    <h1>Halocharis noeana</h1>
<p>Halocharis noeana, commonly known as the desert daphne, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in hot, dry climates with minimal water. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, narrow, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Halocharis noeana is well adapted to rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
