<p>Hordeum murinum var. hrasdanicum, commonly known as the mouse barley, is a wild grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairy stems that often root at the base. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with pale green to brown bracts, and its seeds are typically dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a common weed in agricultural and natural habitats.</p>
