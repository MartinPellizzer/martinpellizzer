<p>Herniaria glabra var. atrovirens, commonly known as the black sandplant, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dune environments and along rocky shores. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and borne in clusters, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ability to tolerate harsh coastal conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
