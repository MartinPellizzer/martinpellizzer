                    <h1>Hetaeria pelota</h1>
<p>Hetaeria pelota, commonly known as the pelota lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms a distinctive, flat, leaf-like structure.</p>
<p>It typically grows on tree bark, especially on conifers, in temperate to subtropical regions. The thallus is usually green to yellowish in color, with a smooth or slightly wrinkled surface. It consists of a symbiotic association between a photosynthetic alga and a fungal partner.</p>
<p>This lichen is often used as an indicator species for air quality due to its sensitivity to pollutants.</p>
