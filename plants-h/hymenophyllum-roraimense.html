                    <h1>Hymenophyllum roraimense</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum roraimense, commonly known as the Roraima shield fern, is a rare and delicate epiphytic fern native to the tepuis of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, leathery, and often moss-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes, often growing on rock surfaces or tree trunks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the leaves, typical of the Hymenophyllum genus.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
