                    <h1>Helianthus anomalus</h1>
<p>Helianthus anomalus, commonly known as the swamp sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellow, daisy-like flowers and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in wetland environments. The plant typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn.</p>
<p>Helianthus anomalus plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a habitat for various insects and small animals.</p>
