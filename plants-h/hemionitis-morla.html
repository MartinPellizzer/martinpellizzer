                    <h1>Hemionitis morla</h1>
<p>Hemionitis morla, commonly known as the Morla fern, is a rare and unique plant native to the arid regions of the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Hemionitidaceae family and is characterized by its unusual, spirally arranged leaves that form a dense, rosette-like structure. The plant is adapted to extreme desert conditions, with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, with spores produced in specialized clusters called sorus.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemionitis morla is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
