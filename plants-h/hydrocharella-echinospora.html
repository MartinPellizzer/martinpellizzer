<p>Hydrocharella echinospora, commonly known as the spiny-stemmed waterplant, is a species of aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its branching, spiny stems and small, delicate leaves that float on the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving waters, often found in marshes and ponds. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, with a greenish-yellow color, and it produces small, oval fruits that contain several seeds.</p>
