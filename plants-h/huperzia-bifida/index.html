                            <h1>Huperzia Bifida</h1>
<p>Split fern, scientifically known as Huperzia bifida, is a unique and ancient plant that belongs to the family Huperziaceae. Native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia, it thrives in shaded, moist environments where it can grow slowly over time. Its distinctive appearance features a segmented, club-like stem with spirally arranged leaves that give it a striking, almost architectural look. Despite its delicate appearance, the split fern is remarkably resilient, able to survive in low-light conditions and with minimal water. This plant has also gained attention for its potential medicinal properties, making it both an ecological and botanical curiosity.</p>
