<p>Hargasseria cestrifolia, commonly known as the creeping marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread along the ground and form dense mats. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>Due to its adaptability, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
