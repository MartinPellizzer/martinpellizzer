                    <h1>Helianthemum montanum var. alpestre</h1>
<p>Helianthemum montanum var. alpestre, commonly known as the alpine sunflower, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments with cool temperatures and strong winds. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in meadows and slopes at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters.</p>
