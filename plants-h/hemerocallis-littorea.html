                    <h1>Hemerocallis littorea</h1>
<p>Hemerocallis littorea, commonly known as the marsh daylily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, fragrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to waterlogged soils and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it a common sight in riparian zones. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Despite its ornamental value, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread.</p>
