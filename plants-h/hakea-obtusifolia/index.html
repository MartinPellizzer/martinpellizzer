                            <h1>Hakea Obtusifolia</h1>
<p>Hakea with broad leaves, scientifically known as Hakea obtusifolia, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. This plant is characterized by its thick, waxy foliage that ranges from gray-green to deep blue, giving it a unique and rugged appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens and dry landscapes. The plant produces vibrant red or orange flowers in spring, attracting native birds and adding a burst of color to the environment. With its resilience and aesthetic appeal, Hakea obtusifolia is both a valuable ornamental plant and an important part of local ecosystems.</p>
