<p>Hordeum hibernans, commonly known as winter barley, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>

Its leaves are narrow and tough, with a bluish-green hue, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>Hordeum hibernans is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and as a food source for wildlife.</p>
