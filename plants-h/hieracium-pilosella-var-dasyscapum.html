                    <h1>Hieracium pilosella var. dasyscapum</h1>
<p>Hieracium pilosella var. dasyscapum, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its dense, hairy leaves and small, yellowish to reddish flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges. It produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal, aiding in its spread.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas.</p>
