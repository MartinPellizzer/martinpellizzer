<p>Hieracium jurassicum subsp.</p>
<p>papyraceum, commonly known as the Jurassic hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly lanceolate, hairy leaves and is typically found in dry, calcareous habitats.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow disc flowers with numerous tubular florets, which bloom in summer. It is notable for its historical association with the Jurassic period, as its fossils have been found in sedimentary rocks from that era.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
