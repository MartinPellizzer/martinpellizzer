                    <h1>Hermannia nivea</h1>
<p>Hermannia nivea, commonly known as the white hermannia, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine white hairs, giving it a frosty appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Hermannia nivea is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
