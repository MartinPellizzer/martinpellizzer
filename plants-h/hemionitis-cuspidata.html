                    <h1>Hemionitis cuspidata</h1>
<p>Hemionitis cuspidata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a small aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize new areas and stabilize sediment.</p>
<p>Hemionitis cuspidata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
