<p>Himantoglossum secundiflorum, commonly known as the lesser marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to wet meadows and marshes in Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30â€“60 cm, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from waterlogged soils, and it plays an important role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions.</p>
