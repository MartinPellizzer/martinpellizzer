<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are hairy and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
