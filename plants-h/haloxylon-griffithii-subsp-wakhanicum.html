<p>Haloxylon griffithii subsp.</p>
<p>wakhanicum, commonly known as the Wakhan haloxylon, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and reduced leaves, which are adapted to minimize water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in panicles, followed by small, hard pods containing seeds. It is well-suited for desert conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its geographic distribution and morphological traits that set it apart from other subspecies of Haloxylon.</p>
