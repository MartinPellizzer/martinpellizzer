                    <h1>Henckelia briggsioides</h1>
<p>Henckelia briggsioides, commonly known as the Australian ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments with rich, well-drained soil, typically found in moist, rocky areas. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of its leaves, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, Henckelia briggsioides is considered a conservation concern.</p>
