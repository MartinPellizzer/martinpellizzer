                    <h1>Hemionitis myrtillifolia</h1>
<p>Hemionitis myrtillifolia, commonly known as the pink marsh fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific regions of China.</p>
<p>It thrives in wetland environments, often found in shallow, freshwater habitats. The plant has finely divided, feather-like leaves that are typically light green with a reddish or pinkish hue. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, with spores produced on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of wetland health.</p>
