                    <h1>Hakea circumalata</h1>
<p>Hakea circumalata, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical branches and small, needle-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody structure and ability to thrive in sandy soils make it well-suited to coastal environments.</p>
<p>Hakea circumalata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion.</p>
