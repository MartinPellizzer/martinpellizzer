                            <h1>Hibbertia Banksii</h1>
<p>Hibbertia banksii is a striking flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. Known for its vibrant yellow flowers and distinctive leaf patterns, it is a member of the Dilleniaceae family. This species thrives in sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal scrub. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for gardeners and botanists alike. Despite its beauty, it remains a relatively rare and underappreciated plant in the wild.</p>
