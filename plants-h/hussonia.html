<p>Hussonia, commonly known as the desert lily, is a genus of flowering plants in the amaryllis family, Amaryllidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. They are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. Hussonia species are typically perennial, with thick, fleshy roots that help them survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Their foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to minimize water loss.</p>
