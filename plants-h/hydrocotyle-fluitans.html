                    <h1>Hydrocotyle fluitans</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle fluitans, commonly known as floating pennywort, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that float on the water surface, with short petioles that anchor it to the substrate. The plant produces white, star-shaped flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. It spreads rapidly through both seeds and vegetative propagation, making it an invasive species in many regions.</p>
<p>Its presence can alter water chemistry and outcompete native plants for resources.</p>
