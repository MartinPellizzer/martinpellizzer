                    <h1>Hedlundia caucasica</h1>
<p>Hedlundia caucasica, commonly known as the Caucasian hedgehog cactus, is a succulent plant native to the Caucasus region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are reduced to spines, a feature typical of many desert plants, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Hedlundia caucasica is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience.</p>
