<p>Hieracium regressum, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can form dense mats due to its stolons. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Hieracium regressum is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth.</p>
