                    <h1>Hypericum vulcanicum f. nigrum</h1>
<p>Hypericum vulcanicum f. nigrum, commonly known as the black-stemmed St. John's wort, is a rare and unique variant of the St. John's wort species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black stems, which distinguish it from the typical green stems of other Hypericum species. This plant is native to specific regions in Italy, particularly the island of Vulcano, where it thrives in volcanic soils. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in its native range.</p>
