                    <h1>Hieracium pseudochevallieri</h1>
<p>Hieracium pseudochevallieri, commonly known as the false hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of sparsely hairy, lanceolate leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is found in meadows, pastures, and woodland edges across Europe. It has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in agricultural areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to thrive in disturbed habitats, it is often considered an invasive species in non-native regions.</p>
