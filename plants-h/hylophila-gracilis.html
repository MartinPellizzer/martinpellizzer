<p>Hylophila gracilis, commonly known as the slender water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has delicate, feathery fronds that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. Its rhizomes form dense mats, which help stabilize sediment and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Hylophila gracilis is valued in aquariums for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
