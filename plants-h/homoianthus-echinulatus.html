<p>Homoianthus echinulatus, commonly known as the spiny leaf shrub, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine, spiny hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the cooler months. Its root system is deep and drought-resistant, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens.</p>
