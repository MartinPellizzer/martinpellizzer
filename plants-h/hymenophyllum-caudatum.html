                <h1>Hymenophyllum caudatum</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum caudatum, commonly known as the long-leaf fern, is a delicate epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It features slender, wiry fronds that are typically 30â€“60 cm in length, with a distinctive elongated shape. The plant has small, closely spaced leaves that form a dense, moss-like appearance, and its rhizomes are often covered in a fine, velvety coating. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks.</p>
<p>The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
