                    <h1>Hymenaea cangaceira</h1>
<p>Hymenaea cangaceira, commonly known as the Brazilian桃花心木, is a large, slow-growing tree native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fibrous bark and large, simple leaves that are often shed during the dry season. The tree produces yellowish flowers that are followed by long, woody pods containing flat, hard seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a significant resource in local economies.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
