                <h1>Homalobus palliseri</h1>
<p>Homalobus palliseri, commonly known as the Palliser's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the dry, rocky regions of southern Africa, particularly in Namibia and South Africa. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk with a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to two meters in length. Its cones are dioecious, with separate male and female plants, and it produces both pollen and seed cones.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Homalobus palliseri is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human activities.</p>
