<p>Hieracium obesifolium, commonly known as the fat-leaf hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy, and often woolly leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Its leaves and stems are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
