                    <h1>Heliamphora folliculata</h1>
<p>Heliamphora folliculata, commonly known as the pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the tepuis of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive enzyme-laden liquid to trap and digest insects. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires high humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs that aid in trapping prey.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it a fascinating subject for both ecological study and horticultural interest.</p>
