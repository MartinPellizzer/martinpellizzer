<p>Haloragis nodulosa, commonly known as the nodular willow herb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland heathlands.</p>
<p>Haloragis nodulosa is adapted to arid conditions and is drought-tolerant once established.</p>
