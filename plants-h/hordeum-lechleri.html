                    <h1>Hordeum lechleri</h1>
<p>Hordeum lechleri, commonly known as *Dragon's Blood Tree*, is a rare and unique plant native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-shaped crown and thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid environment. The plant produces a dark red, resinous sap that has been used for centuries in traditional medicine and as a natural dye. Its botanical significance lies in its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in the ecological balance of the rainforest.</p>
<p>However, it is critically endangered due to habitat loss and overharvesting of its valuable sap.</p>
