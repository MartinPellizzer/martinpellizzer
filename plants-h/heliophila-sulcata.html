<p>Heliophila sulcata, commonly known as the marsh woundwort, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in Europe and Asia.</p>

The plant features slender, erect stems that are often reddish in color, and its small, white or pale blue flowers are arranged in spikes. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a distinctive spongy texture that aids in buoyancy.</p>
