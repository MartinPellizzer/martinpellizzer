<p>Hornungia alpina subsp.</p>
<p>font-queri, commonly known as the alpine hornungia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of the Alps. It typically forms dense cushions or mats, with small, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers in late summer, which are borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, harsh mountain environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range.</p>
