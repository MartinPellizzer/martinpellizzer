<p>Herpolirion novae-zelandiae, commonly known as the New Zealand herpolirion, is a unique fern native to the forests of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under tree canopies or in rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing clusters, are located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
