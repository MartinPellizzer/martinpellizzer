                    <h1>Herpestis caespitosa</h1>
<p>Herpestis caespitosa, commonly known as the clustered bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It possesses small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, which it then digests to obtain nutrients. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, hence its common name, and has slender, branching stems that often root at the nodes. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in spikes, and it blooms from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Despite its carnivorous nature, it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling insect populations and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
