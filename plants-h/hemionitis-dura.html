                    <h1>Hemionitis dura</h1>
<p>Hemionitis dura, commonly known as the hard hemionitis, is a rare and delicate fern native to arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing clusters, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Hemionitis dura is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
