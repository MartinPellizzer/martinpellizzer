                    <h1>Hohenbergia chrysocoma</h1>
<p>Hohenbergia chrysocoma, commonly known as the golden rosette, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact rosette of fleshy, bright green leaves that are often tinged with yellow or orange, giving it its common name. The plant produces striking orange-red inflorescences that emerge from the center of the rosette, adding a dramatic visual contrast. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Hohenbergia chrysocoma is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
