<p>Hemitomus fruticosus, commonly known as the creeping thornapple, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is characterized by its branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by spherical, spiky fruits. It is often found in rocky or sandy habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its thorny stems and toxic sap, it is generally avoided by livestock and humans.</p>
