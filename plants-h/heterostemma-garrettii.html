<p>Heterostemma garrettii, commonly known as the yellow sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Heterostemma garrettii is often used in traditional medicine and is also cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience.</p>
