<p>Hymenophyllum infortunatum, commonly known as the lucky fern, is a small, delicate moss-like fern belonging to the Hymenophyllaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, hair-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in dense, velvety clusters on the undersides of its leaves.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum infortunatum plays a vital role in maintaining soil moisture and providing microhabitats for various invertebrates.</p>
