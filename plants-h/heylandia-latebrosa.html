<p>Heylandia latebrosa, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Heylandia latebrosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
