                    <h1>Hymenophyllum compactum</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum compactum, commonly known as the compact hart's tongue fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features a dense, leathery foliage with narrow, strap-like fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in specialized structures called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum compactum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and air-purifying properties.</p>
