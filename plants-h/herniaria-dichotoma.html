                    <h1>Herniaria dichotoma</h1>
<p>Herniaria dichotoma, commonly known as sand pearl or sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in sandy and coastal environments.</p>
<p>It has small, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces tiny white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Its root system is shallow and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself in loose, nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Herniaria dichotoma plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in coastal ecosystems.</p>
