<p>Hakea elliotii, commonly known as Elliot's hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It features needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces cylindrical, red or orange flower spikes that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It is adapted to grow in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Elliot's hakea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in native habitats.</p>
