<p>Cushion fern, scientifically known as Hymenophyllum cuneatum var. terminale, is a unique and delicate species of fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. This small, low-growing plant forms dense, rounded cushions of foliage that resemble a soft, green mat on the forest floor. It is native to regions of Southeast Asia, where it often grows on rocks or in humid, shaded areas of tropical forests. Despite its modest size, the cushion fern plays an important ecological role by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for small invertebrates. Its intricate leaf structure and ability to retain moisture make it a fascinating subject for both botanists and nature enthusiasts.</p>
