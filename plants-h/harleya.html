                    <h1>Harleya</h1>
<p>Harleya, commonly known as the "dove orchid," is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>Native to the cloud forests of Central and South America, these plants are characterized by their striking, often brightly colored flowers. They typically grow as epiphytes, attaching themselves to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Harleya species are noted for their intricate floral structures and are often cultivated for their ornamental value.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, many species are threatened with extinction.</p>
