                    <h1>Hoarea ornithopifolia</h1>
<p>Hoarea ornithopifolia, commonly known as the golden cholla, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spineless, cylindrical stems that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green, fleshy structure. Its ability to store water in its stems allows it to thrive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Hoarea ornithopifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
