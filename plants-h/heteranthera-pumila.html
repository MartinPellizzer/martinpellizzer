<p>Heteranthera pumila, commonly known as the small-flowered heteranthera, is a small aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer. Its reproductive structures include both stamens and pistils, with some flowers having two stamens and others having one.</p>
<p>Heteranthera pumila is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
