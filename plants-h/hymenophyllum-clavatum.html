<p>Hymenophyllum clavatum, commonly known as the club moss fern, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>

Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum clavatum is notable for its intricate, lace-like appearance and its role in maintaining ecological balance in humid, tropical regions.</p>
