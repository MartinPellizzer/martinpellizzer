<p>Hypolepis rugosula subsp.</p>
<p>rudis, commonly known as the rough shield fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically divided into a series of triangular pinnae.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, typical of the fern family.</p>
<p>The subspecies rudis is distinguished by its coarser texture and more prominently veined leaves compared to other subspecies of Hypolepis rugosula.</p>
