<p>Hypoxis domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican yellowstar, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Hypoxis domingensis is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance.</p>
