<p>Habenaria pumiloides, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a small terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinct lip that is often darker in color. It has a rhizomatous root system and possesses pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and specific habitat requirements, it is often challenging to cultivate outside its natural range.</p>
