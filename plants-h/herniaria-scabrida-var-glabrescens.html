                    <h1>Herniaria scabrida var. glabrescens</h1>
<p>Herniaria scabrida var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth herniaria, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and coastal areas.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or on limestone outcrops.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered a rare and specialized species in its native habitat.</p>
