<p>Henriettella triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered henriettella, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its delicate, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters of three. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it can receive adequate light without direct sun exposure. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a smooth texture and a slight waxy coating.</p>
<p>Henriettella triflora is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and distinctive floral morphology.</p>
