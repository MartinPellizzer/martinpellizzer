<p>Huperzia talamancana, commonly known as the Talamancan clubmoss, is a species of primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant produces sporangia on specialized structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of its branches. Huperzia talamancana is native to Central America, particularly in countries like Costa Rica and Panama.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
