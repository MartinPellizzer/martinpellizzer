                    <h1>Hieronymiella vittata</h1>
<p>Hieronymiella vittata, commonly known as the golden ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant features delicate, strap-like leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers with a distinctive golden stripe down the center of each petal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
