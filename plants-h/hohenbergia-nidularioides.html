                    <h1>Hohenbergia nidularioides</h1>
<p>Hohenbergia nidularioides, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, dark green leaves that form a cup-like structure to collect rainwater. The plant produces showy, orchid-like flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens.</p>
