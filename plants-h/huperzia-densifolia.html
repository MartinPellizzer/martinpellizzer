<p>Huperzia densifolia, commonly known as the dense-leaved clubmoss, is a species of primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are densely packed and often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobili, which contain the sporangia for spore production. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices.</p>
<p>Huperzia densifolia is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also studied for its potential medicinal properties.</p>
