                    <h1>Hemionitis subdimorpha</h1>
<p>Hemionitis subdimorpha, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a rare and unique fern native to the high altitudes of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the leaves. Hemionitis subdimorpha thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
