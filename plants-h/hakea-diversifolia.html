                    <h1>Hakea diversifolia</h1>
<p>Hakea diversifolia, commonly known as the variable hakea, is a shrub native to western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, often spiny foliage and produces striking, cylindrical flower spikes that range in color from yellow to red. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its flowers are pollinated by birds, particularly honeyeaters, and the plant produces woody, cone-like seed pods.</p>
<p>Hakea diversifolia is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
