<p>Hieracium glaucum subsp.</p>
<p>nipholepium, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found in mountain meadows and alpine tundra, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its habitat.</p>
