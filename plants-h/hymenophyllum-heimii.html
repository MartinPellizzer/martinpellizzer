<p>Hymenophyllum heimii, commonly known as the silver moss, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its leaves are delicate, with a silvery appearance due to the presence of dense, fine trichomes. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia.</p>
<p>It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>
