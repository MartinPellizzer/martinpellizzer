                    <h1>Howardia gigantea</h1>
<p>Howardia gigantea, commonly known as the giant hydnoid, is a unique species of fungus in the family Hydnaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, sac-like fruiting bodies that release spores through a network of threads rather than wind. The structure of Howardia gigantea is adapted for spore dispersal, with a gelatinous coating that helps retain moisture. It typically grows on decaying wood in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>This fungus plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling within forest ecosystems.</p>
