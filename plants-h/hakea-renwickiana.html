                    <h1>Hakea renwickiana</h1>
<p>Hakea renwickiana, commonly known as the Renwick's hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It features needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery bloom, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces vibrant red or orange cylindrical flower spikes during spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It is well adapted to dry conditions and can thrive in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Hakea renwickiana is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
