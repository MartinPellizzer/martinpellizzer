                    <h1>Hedysarum exiguum</h1>
<p>Hedysarum exiguum, commonly known as the dwarf milkvetch, is a low-growing perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It typically reaches a height of only a few inches, with small, trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules.</p>
<p>Hedysarum exiguum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.</p>
