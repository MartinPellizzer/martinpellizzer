<p>Humboltia capillaris, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of California and Baja California.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous annual with slender, hairy stems and small, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of purple and blue. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and along the coastline. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas quickly.</p>
<p>Humboltia capillaris plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
