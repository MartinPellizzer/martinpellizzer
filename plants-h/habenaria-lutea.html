<p>Habenaria lutea, commonly known as the yellow twayblade, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its mycorrhizal associations, which aid in nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in some regions.</p>
