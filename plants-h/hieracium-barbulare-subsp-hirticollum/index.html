                            <h1>Hieracium Barbulare Subsp. Hirticollum</h1>
<p>Hieracium barbulare subsp. hirticollum is a lesser-known member of the daisy family known for its distinctive appearance and ecological significance. This subspecies is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and woodland edges across Europe. Its hairy stems and yellow flowers make it easily identifiable among other members of the genus. While not widely cultivated, it plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining biodiversity. Understanding and preserving this plant is crucial for the health of its native ecosystems.</p>
