                    <h1>Helleborus hunfalvyanus var. odorus</h1>
<p>Helleborus hunfalvyanus var. odorus, commonly known as the sweet-scented hellebore, is a rare and distinctive member of the Ranunculaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the Carpathian Mountains in Central Europe, where it thrives in shaded, moist woodland environments. The plant is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. One of its most notable features is its fragrant, sweet scent, which is more pronounced in the evening.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
