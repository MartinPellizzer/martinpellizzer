<p>Heuchera micrantha var. erubescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed alumroot, is a striking perennial plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features dense, matted foliage that ranges from deep red to bronze, with a striking contrast against its slender, reddish stems. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in late spring, which are clustered in upright cymes. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value lies in its vibrant foliage and ability to naturalize over time.</p>
