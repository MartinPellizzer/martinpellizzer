                    <h1>Haptocarpum</h1>
<p>Haptocarpum, commonly known as the "hooked carpus," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their unique seed structures, where the seeds are attached to the fruit by a fleshy, hook-like structure called a carpus. Haptocarpum species typically grow in arid and semi-arid regions, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. The plants have simple, alternate leaves and produce small, inconspicuous flowers.</p>
<p>Their botanical features make them interesting subjects for study in plant morphology and ecological adaptation.</p>
