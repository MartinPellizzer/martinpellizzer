<p>Helianthemum polyanthum f. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous rock rose, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in early summer. The plant has a dense, mat-like growth habit with greyish-green foliage that is often covered in fine hairs, though the 'glabrescens' form is characterized by its reduced hairiness. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal environments.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in Mediterranean climates.</p>
