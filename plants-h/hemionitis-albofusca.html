                    <h1>Hemionitis albofusca</h1>
<p>Hemionitis albofusca, commonly known as the pale bristly fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are covered in a dense layer of silky, pale hairs, giving it a distinctive, almost ghostly appearance. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments, typically found in shaded, rocky or forested areas. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of its fronds, a common feature among ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemionitis albofusca is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
