<p>Hieracium vitellinum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring well-drained conditions. Its yellow flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Hieracium vitellinum is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit.</p>
