                    <h1>Hedypnois aculeata</h1>
<p>Hedypnois aculeata, commonly known as the spiny ant plant, is a unique species within the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the humid forests of South America, particularly in regions of Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, a feature common among bromeliads. Its most distinctive trait is the presence of stiff, spiny projections along the leaf margins, which provide structural support and possibly deter herbivores.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pollinated by insects rather than by wind.</p>
