                    <h1>Huxleya</h1>
<p>Huxleya, commonly known as the "ice plant" or "desert rose," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Aizoaceae.</p>
<p>These succulent plants are native to arid regions of southern Africa, where they thrive in hot, dry climates. Huxleya species are characterized by their fleshy, often blue or purple-tinted leaves and showy, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow, orange, or red. They are well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in their thick leaves and stems.</p>
<p>Due to their striking appearance and low maintenance requirements, Huxleya plants are popular among succulent enthusiasts and are often cultivated in rock gardens or as container plants.</p>
