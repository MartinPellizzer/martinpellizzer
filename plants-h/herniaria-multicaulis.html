                    <h1>Herniaria multicaulis</h1>
<p>Herniaria multicaulis, commonly known as the many-stemmed bladderwort, is a small, mat-forming plant that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing structure with numerous short, branching stems. The plant produces tiny, bladder-like structures called pseudobracts, which are often mistaken for true flowers. These pseudobracts are typically green or reddish in color and contain specialized cells that can trap small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Herniaria multicaulis is commonly found in coastal areas and is adapted to harsh, salty environments.</p>
