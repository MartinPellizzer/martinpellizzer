<p>Haworthia venosa subsp.</p>
<p>tessellata, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves covered in white to pale blue tubercles that resemble a zebra's stripes.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually a pale green to blue-gray color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, white or pale green flowers on slender stems during the growing season.</p>
<p>This plant is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact size and ornamental appearance.</p>
