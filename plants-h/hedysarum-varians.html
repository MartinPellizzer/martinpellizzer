<p>Hedysarum varians, commonly known as the variable vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow or orange-red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces cylindrical pods containing several small, kidney-shaped seeds. Hedysarum varians is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments.</p>
<p>It plays a role in soil stabilization and nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
