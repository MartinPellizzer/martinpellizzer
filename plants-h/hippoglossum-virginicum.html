<p>Hippoglossum virginicum, commonly known as the Virginia flat-tail, is a rare fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, flat fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery spores. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks. Its spores are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in its native range.</p>
