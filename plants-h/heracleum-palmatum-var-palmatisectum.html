<p>Heracleum palmatum var. palmatisectum, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a tall, biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features a thick, hairy stem that can grow up to 5 meters in height, with large, compound leaves that are deeply lobed and resemble a palm. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in umbrella-like inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are thick and fleshy, and it is known for its toxic sap containing phototoxic chemicals.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature and potential to cause severe skin reactions, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions.</p>
