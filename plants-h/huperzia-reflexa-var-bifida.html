                    <h1>Huperzia reflexa var. bifida</h1>
<p>Huperzia reflexa var. bifida, commonly known as the bifid huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, bifurcated (split) sporophylls, which are the leaf-like structures that bear spores. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its fronds are usually lance-shaped and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its unique morphology and is often found in temperate regions across Asia and North America.</p>
