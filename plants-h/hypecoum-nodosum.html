<p>Hypecoum nodosum, commonly known as the nodding hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring.

Hypecoum nodosum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens or woodland settings.</p>
<p>It is also noted for its medicinal properties, though it contains toxic compounds that require caution in handling.</p>
