                <h1>Huperzia koolauensis</h1>
<p>Huperzia koolauensis, commonly known as the Koolau fern, is a species of clubmoss native to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a distinctive spore-producing structure called a synangium, which is a key feature in its reproductive cycle. Huperzia koolauensis is typically found growing on rocky outcrops or in coastal areas, where it contributes to the unique flora of Hawaii.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
