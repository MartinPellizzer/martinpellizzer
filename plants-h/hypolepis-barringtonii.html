<p>Hypolepis barringtonii, commonly known as the Barrington's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other water ferns. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as swamps and along stream edges. Its rhizomes are often submerged, allowing it to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
