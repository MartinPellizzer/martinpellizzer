<p>Hemiphora elderi, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a succulent shrub characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and small, pale green leaves. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom at night. Hemiphora elderi is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments by storing water in its thick stems.</p>
<p>Its nocturnal flowering is an adaptation to avoid daytime heat and attract specific pollinators.</p>
