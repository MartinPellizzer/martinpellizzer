                    <h1>Haloxylon recurvum</h1>
<p>Haloxylon recurvum, commonly known as the desert date tree, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by fleshy, edible fruits that are an important food source for wildlife and humans. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Haloxylon recurvum plays a crucial role in stabilizing sandy soils and preventing desertification in its native habitats.</p>
