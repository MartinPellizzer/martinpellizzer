<p>Hemprichia erythraea, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are often ovate or elliptic in shape. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, winged fruits.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species in many regions.</p>
