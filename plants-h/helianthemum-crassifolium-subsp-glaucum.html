<p>Helianthemum crassifolium subsp.</p>
<p>glaucum, commonly known as the glaucous rock rose, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a waxy, bluish-gray coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>

<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping.</p>
