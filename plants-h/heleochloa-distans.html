                    <h1>Heleochloa distans</h1>
<p>Heleochloa distans, commonly known as the distant hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in meadows or along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slight waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Heleochloa distans is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various insects and small animals.</p>
