<p>Haageocereus litoralis, commonly known as the coastal candelabra cactus, is a species native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive branching structure that forms a candelabra-like shape. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in inflorescences at the ends of its branches. It is adapted to arid and coastal environments, with thick, fleshy stems that store water.</p>
<p>Its spines provide protection from herbivores and help reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
