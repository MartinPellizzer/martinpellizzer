                    <h1>Holcus lanatus var. viviparus</h1>
<p>Holcus lanatus var. viviparus, commonly known as the viviparous meadow grass, is a variant of the common meadowgrass species.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. This variant is notable for its vivipary, a reproductive strategy where seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant. The plant typically thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils in meadows and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study.</p>
