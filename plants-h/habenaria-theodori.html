                    <h1>Habenaria theodori</h1>
<p>Habenaria theodori, commonly known as the Madagascar ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pale green to brownish flowers that resemble the shape of a ghostly figure, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its small, strap-like leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces a single spike of flowers during the wet season.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, Habenaria theodori is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
