<p>Hymenophyllum nigricans, commonly known as the black moss, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, delicate plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant features narrow, elongated leaves that are covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures called trichomes. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a flap-like covering called an indusium.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum nigricans is characterized by its dark green to blackish coloration, which gives it its common name.</p>
