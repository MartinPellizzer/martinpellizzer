<p>Hieracium × auriculinum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, showing a preference for temperate climates. It produces numerous small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings.</p>
