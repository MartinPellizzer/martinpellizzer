                    <h1>Hieracium × linderi</h1>
<p>Hieracium × linderi, commonly known as the hybrid hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Hieracium auripunctatum and Hieracium piloselloides, leading to a diverse range of morphological characteristics. The plant typically features bright yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, with slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. It is native to Europe and is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits variability in growth habits and floral morphology, making it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
