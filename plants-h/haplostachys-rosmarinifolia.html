<p>Haplostachys rosmarinifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Its root system is adapted to store water, allowing it to survive prolonged droughts.</p>
<p>Haplostachys rosmarinifolia is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
