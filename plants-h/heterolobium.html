                    <h1>Heterolobium</h1>
<p>Heterolobium, commonly known as the burr medic, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their unique, spiny pods that enclose their seeds, often resembling small, woody burrs. Heterolobium species are typically shrubs or small trees, native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia and Africa. They have deep root systems that allow them to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>The genus is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil rehabilitation and as a forage plant.</p>
