                    <h1>Hieracium angustifolium var. stoloniferum</h1>
<p>Hieracium angustifolium var. stoloniferum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, typically arranged in a flat-topped cluster. It spreads via stolons, which are horizontal stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to colonize open areas.</p>
<p>This species is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators.</p>
