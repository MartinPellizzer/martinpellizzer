<p>Hohenbergia distichantha, commonly known as the silver stripe hohenbergia, is a perennial bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, fleshy, silver-green leaves that are often marked with white or pale green stripes. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers on a central stem, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Hohenbergia distichantha is prized for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
