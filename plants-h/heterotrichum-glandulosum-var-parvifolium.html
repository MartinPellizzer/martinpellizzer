                    <h1>Heterotrichum glandulosum var. parvifolium</h1>
<p>Heterotrichum glandulosum var. parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved marsh moss, is a variant of the glandular heterotrichum, characterized by its diminutive, ovate leaves.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands, where it forms dense, cushion-like mats. The leaves are usually less than 1 cm in length and have a smooth, glossy surface with scattered glandular dots. The plant lacks true stems and instead relies on a network of rhizoids for anchoring and nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and release spores when mature.</p>
