<p>Hymenophyllum falklandicum f. andinum, commonly known as the Andean spore moss, is a rare fern belonging to the Hymenophyllaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or in moist, shaded forests. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sporangia, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This fern is notable for its unique morphology and ecological niche, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
