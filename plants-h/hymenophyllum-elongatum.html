                    <h1>Hymenophyllum elongatum</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum elongatum, commonly known as the long-stalked mistletoe, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are often covered with a fine layer of trichomes, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. It is typically found growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it plays a role in supporting various microfauna and contributing to forest biodiversity.</p>
