<p>Hippuris tetraphylla f. lacunarum, commonly known as the marsh penny cress, is a perennial aquatic plant that thrives in shallow, freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive four-lobed leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is often found in wetlands, along the edges of ponds, and in slow-moving streams. Its roots help stabilize the soil, preventing erosion in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>The f. lacunarum form is distinguished by its unique leaf structure and habitat preferences compared to other forms of Hippuris tetraphylla.</p>
