                    <h1>Heliamphora minor f. minor</h1>
<p>Heliamphora minor f. minor, commonly known as the lesser sun pitcher, is a carnivorous plant native to the tepuis of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and broad, pitcher-shaped leaves that form deep, water-filled traps. The plant's pitchers are typically green or reddish in color and are covered in fine, downward-pointing hairs that aid in trapping prey. It thrives in high-altitude, humid environments with nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Heliamphora minor f. minor plays an important ecological role by capturing insects, contributing to the nutrient cycling in its unique habitat.</p>
