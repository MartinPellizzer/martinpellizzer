                    <h1>Hysteria</h1>
<p>Hysteria, commonly known as the "hysterical plant," is a term that refers to a group of flowering plants in the genus *Pteridium*, which includes the bracken fern.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their large, feather-like fronds and are often found in moist, shaded environments. Hysteria species are perennial and reproduce through spores, with a complex life cycle involving both sporophyte and gametophyte stages. They are also known for their ability to thrive in disturbed soils, making them common in forested areas and along roadsides.</p>
<p>However, some species of hysteria can be toxic to livestock and humans if ingested.</p>
