<p>Helianthus annuus mut.</p>
<p>inornatus, commonly known as the "inornate sunflower," is a variant of the common sunflower characterized by its lack of ray florets, resulting in a predominantly disk-like appearance. This mutation leads to a more compact flower head with a dense arrangement of tubular florets.</p>
<p>It is native to North America and typically grows in open fields and disturbed soils. The plant is an annual herb with a robust stem and large, broad leaves.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a unique subject in both horticulture and botanical studies.</p>
