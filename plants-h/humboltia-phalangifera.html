<p>Humboltia phalangifera, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and broad, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom during the warm seasons. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Humboltia phalangifera is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
