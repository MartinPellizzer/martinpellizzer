<p>Helichrysum quartinianum, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and bright yellow to orange flowers. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in a white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Helichrysum quartinianum is often used in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting, dried floral form.</p>
