<p>It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a deep taproot system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
