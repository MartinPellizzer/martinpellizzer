                    <h1>Hemionitis sagittifolia</h1>
<p>Hemionitis sagittifolia, commonly known as the arrowleaf fern, is a unique aquatic plant native to the wetlands of eastern Australia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, arrow-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shallow, still water and is often found in swampy or marshy habitats. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Hemionitis sagittifolia plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration.</p>
