<p>Hieracium bifidum subsp.</p>
<p>sagittibasis, commonly known as the arrowleaf hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate to arrow-shaped leaves, which are often hairy and have a distinctive basal lobing.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in a single, erect head, surrounded by pale green bracts. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as meadows and roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings.</p>
