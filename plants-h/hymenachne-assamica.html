                    <h1>Hymenachne assamica</h1>
<p>Hymenachne assamica, commonly known as the Assam sedge, is a perennial grass species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland and marshy environments, thriving in humid and tropical climates. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Hymenachne assamica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and environmental benefits.</p>
