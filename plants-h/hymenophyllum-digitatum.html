                    <h1>Hymenophyllum digitatum</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum digitatum, commonly known as the fingered hound's-tongue, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble fingers, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are covered with a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures called trichomes, which help retain moisture.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, or sporangia, are borne on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a specialized layer called the hymenium.</p>
