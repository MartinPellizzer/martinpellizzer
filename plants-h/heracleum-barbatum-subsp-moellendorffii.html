<p>moellendorffii, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a tall biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features large, umbrella-like compound leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, with a hairy surface.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in umbrella-shaped inflorescences, which are followed by follicles containing seeds. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found near rivers, ditches, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it is considered a noxious weed and requires caution when handling.</p>
