                    <h1>Hymenophyllum henryi</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum henryi, commonly known as the Henry's filmy fern, is a small epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are thin and translucent, with a unique structure that allows for efficient water retention.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
