<p>Haplopappus parrasanus, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in sandy, nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Haplopappus parrasanus plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
