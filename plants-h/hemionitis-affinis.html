                <h1>Hemionitis affinis</h1>
<p>Hemionitis affinis, commonly known as the water hawksbeard, is a rare and specialized aquatic plant found primarily in the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery leaves that are adapted to thrive in shallow, freshwater environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, typically along the edges of ponds and marshes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize sediments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemionitis affinis is considered an indicator species for healthy wetland ecosystems.</p>
