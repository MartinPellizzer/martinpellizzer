                    <h1>Hakea adenotricha</h1>
<p>Hakea adenotricha, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like structures, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody structure and adaptability to coastal conditions make it a hardy species in sandy soils.</p>
<p>Hakea adenotricha plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
