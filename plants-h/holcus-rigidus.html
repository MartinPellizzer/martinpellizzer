<p>Holcus rigidus, commonly known as rigid hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Holcus rigidus typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a common component of grassland ecosystems and a subject of study in ecological and agricultural research.</p>
