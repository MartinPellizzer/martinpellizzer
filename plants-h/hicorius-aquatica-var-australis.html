<p>Hicorius aquatica var. australis, commonly known as the Australian water hyacinth, is a variant of the water hyacinth species native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is a floating aquatic plant characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that form a dense mat on the water surface. The plant produces striking purple-blue flowers that bloom in clusters, adding visual interest to freshwater ecosystems. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters with moderate to high nutrient levels.</p>
<p>However, its rapid growth can lead to waterway clogging, making it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive.</p>
