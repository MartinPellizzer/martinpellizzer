<p>Haloxylon griffithii, commonly known as the Indian date palm, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are often clustered in panicles, followed by edible, date-like fruits. Haloxylon griffithii is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, making it an important species for stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
<p>It is also valued for its ornamental qualities and traditional uses in local communities.</p>
