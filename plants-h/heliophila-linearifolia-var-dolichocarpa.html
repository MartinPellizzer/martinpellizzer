                    <h1>Heliophila linearifolia var. dolichocarpa</h1>
<p>Heliophila linearifolia var. dolichocarpa, commonly known as the long-stemmed water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments.</p>
<p>It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted for water retention. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shallow water or moist soils, making it a common sight in pond edges and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to aquatic ecosystem stability.</p>
