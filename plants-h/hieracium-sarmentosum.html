                    <h1>Hieracium sarmentosum</h1>
<p>Hieracium sarmentosum, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads made up of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can form dense mats due to its stoloniferous growth habit. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive nature.</p>
