                    <h1>Hieracium speluncarum</h1>
<p>Hieracium speluncarum, commonly known as the cave hawkweed, is a rare and elusive plant species found in subterranean environments such as caves and rock crevices.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant thrives in low-light conditions, adapting to the dim and humid microclimates of its habitat. Its leaves are typically narrow and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, Hieracium speluncarum is considered a vulnerable species, with limited distribution and specific ecological requirements.</p>
