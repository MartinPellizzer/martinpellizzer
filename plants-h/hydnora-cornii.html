                    <h1>Hydnora cornii</h1>
<p>Hydnora cornii, commonly known as the African ghost flower, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It is found primarily in the succulent Karoo region of southern Africa, where it attaches to the roots of host plants such as Kalanchoe. The plant produces a distinctive, fleshy, reddish structure that resembles a flower, though it does not open in the traditional sense. Its unique morphology and lack of visible leaves make it a rare and intriguing botanical specimen.</p>
<p>Hydnora cornii relies entirely on its host for nutrients and water, showcasing a specialized adaptation to its environment.</p>
