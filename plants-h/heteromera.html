                    <h1>Heteromera</h1>
<p>Heteromera, commonly known as the "screw vine," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spirally twisted stems that resemble a helix, a feature that gives it its common name. The leaves are typically opposite and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Heteromera species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>They produce small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale yellow, followed by small, berry-like fruits.</p>
