                    <h1>Hartighsea lessertiana</h1>
<p>Hartighsea lessertiana, commonly known as the coastal rock orchid, is a rare and specialized plant found in specific coastal habitats.</p>
<p>It is a flowering plant belonging to the orchid family, characterized by its small, delicate flowers and adaptations to salty, wind-swept environments. The plant has a compact growth form with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Its roots are often clustered near the surface to absorb nutrients from the rocky soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for coastal ecosystem health.</p>
