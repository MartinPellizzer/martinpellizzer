                    <h1>Hoya pandurata</h1>
<p>Hoya pandurata, commonly known as the "butterfly plant," is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its waxy, ovate leaves that are often variegated with white and green patterns. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in response to changes in light and temperature. Hoya pandurata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
