                    <h1>Hystrix sibirica</h1>
<p>Hystrix sibirica, commonly known as the Siberian hedgehog cactus, is a unique succulent native to the cold climates of Siberia.</p>
<p>It features a dense, spiny structure that resembles a hedgehog, with thick, fleshy stems that store water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its adaptations include a waxy cuticle and shallow root system, which help it survive in harsh, arid environments.</p>
<p>Hystrix sibirica is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in challenging conditions.</p>
