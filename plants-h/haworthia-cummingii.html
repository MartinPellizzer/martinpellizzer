                    <h1>Haworthia cummingii</h1>
<p>Haworthia cummingii, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a compact, evergreen succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves with distinctive white or pale green markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The leaves are typically blue-green in color and have a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture. It produces small, white, star-shaped flowers on short stems during the summer months.</p>
<p>This plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light.</p>
