<p>Hieracium niphobium subsp.</p>
<p>atricapitulum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dark, almost blackish purple capitula, which are tightly packed clusters of small florets.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it tolerates cold and harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are usually basal, forming a rosette, and are covered with a dense layer of fine hairs.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its horticultural value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental appearance.</p>
