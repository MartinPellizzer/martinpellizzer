<p>Hevea guianensis subsp.</p>
<p>marginata, commonly known as the Guianan rubber tree, is a species native to South America, particularly found in Guyana and Suriname. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive margin that is often wavy or lobed. The plant produces a latex sap that has been historically used for natural rubber production, though its commercial importance is less than that of Hevea brasiliensis.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in the study of tropical plant biodiversity and latex-producing plants.</p>
