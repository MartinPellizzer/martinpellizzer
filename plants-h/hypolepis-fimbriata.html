<p>Hypolepis fimbriata, commonly known as the fringed shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a serrated or fringed edge. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and the fronds can reach lengths of up to 1 meter.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the wild.</p>
