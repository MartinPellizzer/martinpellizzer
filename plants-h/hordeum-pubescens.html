                    <h1>Hordeum pubescens</h1>
<p>Hordeum pubescens, commonly known as hairy barley, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and the presence of short, stiff hairs on its stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, with each spikelet containing two to three florets. Its seeds are typically small and oval, with a hard outer covering.</p>
<p>Hordeum pubescens is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural fields.</p>
