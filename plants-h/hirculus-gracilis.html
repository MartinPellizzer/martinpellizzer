                    <h1>Hirculus gracilis</h1>
<p>Hirculus gracilis, commonly known as the slender goat plant, is a rare and delicate flowering species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely serrated leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Hirculus gracilis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
