                    <h1>Helianthemum glaucum var. herbaceum</h1>
<p>Helianthemum glaucum var. herbaceum, commonly known as the silver carpet cushion plant, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features dense, silver-gray foliage due to a thick layer of fine, waxy hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.</p>
