                    <h1>Harrimanella hypnoides</h1>
<p>Harrimanella hypnoides, commonly known as the ghost moss, is a rare and delicate liverwort species native to the moist, shaded environments of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its intricate, moss-like appearance with a dense, velvety texture. The plant forms compact cushions or mats, often growing on rocks or decaying wood in cool, humid conditions. Its small, scale-like leaves are arranged in a tight spiral, and it produces tiny, spore-bearing capsules that are often hidden among the foliage.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed, high-elevation ecosystems.</p>
