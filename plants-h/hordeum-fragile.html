                    <h1>Hordeum fragile</h1>
<p>Hordeum fragile, commonly known as brittle barley, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant is adapted to withstand drought conditions, with deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area. Its seeds are typically small and hard, which aids in seed dispersal and survival in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Hordeum fragile is of interest in agricultural research for its potential in developing drought-resistant crop varieties.</p>
