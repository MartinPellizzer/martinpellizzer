                    <h1>Hieracium corymbosum var. melanoglochin</h1>
<p>Hieracium corymbosum var. melanoglochin, commonly known as the blackroot hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, almost black rhizomes, which give it its common name, and its basal rosette of leaves that are typically hairy and lance-shaped. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, branched inflorescences, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some regions and can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
