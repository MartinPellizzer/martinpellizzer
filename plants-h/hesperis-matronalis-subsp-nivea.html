<p>Hesperis matronalis subsp.</p>
<p>nivea, commonly known as the white hawksbeard, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silvery-gray, hairy leaves and tall, branching stems that bear bright yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The flowers are arranged in a single inflorescence at the top of the stem, consisting of many small, petal-less florets. This subspecies is distinguished by its pale, almost white coloration, which sets it apart from the more common yellow-flowered H. matronalis.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable plant for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
