<p>Huperzia banayanica, commonly known as the Banayanica clubmoss, is a species of vascular plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has simple, linear leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along its erect, branching stems. Huperzia banayanica is characterized by its spore-producing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in small, cone-like formations at the ends of its branches.</p>
<p>This species is of interest to botanists due to its primitive features and ecological significance in tropical and subtropical ecosystems.</p>
