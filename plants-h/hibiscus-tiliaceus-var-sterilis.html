                    <h1>Hibiscus tiliaceus var. sterilis</h1>
<p>Hibiscus tiliaceus var. sterilis, commonly known as the sterile hibiscus, is a variant of the coastal hibiscus native to tropical regions of the Pacific and Indian Oceans.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, though it is typically sterile and does not produce fruit. It thrives in coastal areas and is often used for erosion control due to its salt tolerance and robust growth.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in tropical and subtropical climates.</p>
