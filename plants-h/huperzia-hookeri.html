                    <h1>Huperzia hookeri</h1>
<p>Huperzia hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's spikemoss, is a species of fern ally native to tropical regions of Africa and southern Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Huperziaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, evergreen habit with spirally arranged leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically clustered in small, cone-like formations at the tips of the stems. Huperzia hookeri thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
