                    <h1>Hedyotis lasiantha</h1>
<p>Hedyotis lasiantha, commonly known as the small-flowered bedstraw, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in cymes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Hedyotis lasiantha thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine, though its botanical significance lies in its morphology and ecological role in its native habitats.</p>
