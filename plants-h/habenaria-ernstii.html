                    <h1>Habenaria ernstii</h1>
<p>Habenaria ernstii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, white, and often translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows on the bark of trees in wet, shaded environments, forming a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often clustered at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
