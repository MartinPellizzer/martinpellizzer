<p>Haemocarpus cymosus, commonly known as the swamp grass or water grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Australia.</p>
<p>It features erect, leafy stems that often grow in dense clusters, and its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by distinctive, three-lobed seed pods. It thrives in waterlogged soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>Haemocarpus cymosus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic wildlife.</p>
