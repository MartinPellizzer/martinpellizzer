                    <h1>Habenaria herminioides</h1>
<p>Habenaria herminioides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white, spider-like flowers and lacks leaves, relying entirely on its roots for photosynthesis. The plant typically grows on decaying wood in moist, shaded environments, forming a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi. Its unique morphology and habitat requirements make it a challenging species to cultivate.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as endangered in several states.</p>
