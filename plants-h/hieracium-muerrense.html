The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous grasslands and alpine meadows, often at high altitudes. Its yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer, are arranged in a flat-topped cluster.</p>
<p>Hieracium muerrense is noted for its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid mountain habitat.</p>
