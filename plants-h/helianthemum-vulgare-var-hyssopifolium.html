<p>Helianthemum vulgare var. hyssopifolium, commonly known as the purple sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas or dry habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its leaf shape, which resembles that of hyssop, hence its scientific name.</p>
