                    <h1>Helianthemum plantagineum</h1>
<p>Helianthemum plantagineum, commonly known as the creeping sunflower or sand thimble, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
