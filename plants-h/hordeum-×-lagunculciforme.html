                    <h1>Hordeum × lagunculciforme</h1>
<p>Hordeum × lagunculciforme, commonly known as intermediate barley, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Hordeum vulgare (common barley) and Hordeum lejorensis (a wild barley species).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intermediate morphological traits, such as intermediate spikelet structure and growth habits. This hybrid is often found in regions where the parent species co-occur, particularly in temperate climates. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a genetic bridge between cultivated and wild barley species.</p>
<p>Hordeum × lagunculciforme is of interest to plant breeders and researchers studying genetic diversity and evolution in the Hordeum genus.</p>
