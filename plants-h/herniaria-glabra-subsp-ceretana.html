<p>Herniaria glabra subsp.</p>
<p>ceretana, commonly known as the smooth herniaria, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch to rocky or sandy soils. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in coastal areas or dry meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens as a drought-tolerant ground cover.</p>
