<p>Hieracium murorum subsp.</p>
<p>paramaurum, commonly known as the coastal hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of Europe. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in dunes or along the edges of beaches.</p>
<p>The plant features bright yellow flowers arranged in a single head, with ray florets that are often shorter than the central disk. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds, making it a resilient component of maritime ecosystems.</p>
