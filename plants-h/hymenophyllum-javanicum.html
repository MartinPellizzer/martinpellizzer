<p>Hymenophyllum javanicum, commonly known as the Java filmy fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, thin, and translucent fronds that are often covered in a layer of fine, hair-like structures called rhizoids. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are usually less than 10 centimeters in length and exhibit a unique structure with a single layer of cells on the upper surface.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum javanicum plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stabilization and providing microhabitat for small invertebrates.</p>
