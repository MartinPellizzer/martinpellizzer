                    <h1>Hemionitis galeottii</h1>
<p>Hemionitis galeottii, commonly known as the rock fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hemionitidaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered fronds that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. This unique coating helps the plant retain moisture in its harsh, dry environment. The plant thrives in rocky crevices and is adapted to extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, Hemionitis galeottii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
