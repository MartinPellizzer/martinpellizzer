                    <h1>Hydrocotyle nixoides</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle nixoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water shield, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It has small, rounded leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in shallow water.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle nixoides plays an important role in stabilizing aquatic soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
