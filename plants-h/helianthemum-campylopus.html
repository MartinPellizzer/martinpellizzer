                    <h1>Helianthemum campylopus</h1>
<p>Helianthemum campylopus, commonly known as the woolly rockrose, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with dense, silvery-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as a drought-tolerant plant.</p>
