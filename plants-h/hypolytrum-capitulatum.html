<p>Hypolytrum capitulatum, commonly known as the coastal flax or sea flax, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters at the tips of its stems. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to tolerate salt spray and coastal winds.</p>
<p>Hypolytrum capitulatum is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.</p>
