<p>Hippuris tetraphylla, commonly known as the four-leaf water shield, is a semi-aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, marshes, and along the edges of streams. The plant has broad, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with a short, thick stem that supports the foliage. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-yellow, and it produces dark, oval-shaped seeds.</p>
<p>Hippuris tetraphylla plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and contributing to water filtration.</p>
