                    <h1>Hydrocotyle tridentata</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle tridentata, commonly known as the water pennywort, is a small aquatic plant characterized by its floating leaves that are typically divided into three lobes.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has a short, stout stem with numerous small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle tridentata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration.</p>
