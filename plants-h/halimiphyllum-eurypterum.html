<p>Halimiphyllum eurypterum, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, evergreen shrub form. The plant features small, needle-like leaves that are covered in a thick, waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in sandy, coastal soils. Its flowers are typically white or pink and bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Halimiphyllum eurypterum is well adapted to salt spray and wind, making it a common sight in dune and beach environments.</p>
