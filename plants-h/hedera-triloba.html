<p>Hedera triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features dark green, lobed leaves that are typically three-lobed, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Hedera triloba thrives in shaded environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed.</p>
