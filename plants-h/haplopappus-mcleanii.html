                    <h1>Haplopappus mcleanii</h1>
<p>Haplopappus mcleanii, commonly known as the McLean's pappus, is a flowering plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as sagebrush steppe and rocky soils. Its small, yellow to orange flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, hairless seeds in a pappus structure that aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Haplopappus mcleanii is often found in disturbed or open habitats and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils.</p>
