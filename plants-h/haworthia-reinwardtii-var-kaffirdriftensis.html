<p>Haworthia reinwardtii var. kaffirdriftensis, commonly known as the Kaffir drift haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves with white to light green markings. The leaves are typically shorter and broader than those of the typical Haworthia reinwardtii, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces tall, branched flower stalks with small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and container cultivation due to its compact size and ornamental appeal.</p>
