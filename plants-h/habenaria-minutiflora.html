<p>Habenaria minutiflora, commonly known as the minute-flowered orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in small racemes, often blooming in late spring or early summer. The plant has a slender rhizome and produces narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Orchidaceae family.</p>
