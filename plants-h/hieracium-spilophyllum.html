                    <h1>Hieracium spilophyllum</h1>
<p>Hieracium spilophyllum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Hieracium spilophyllum is often found in open meadows and on slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
