                    <h1>Homalocenchrus angustifolius</h1>
<p>Homalocenchrus angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sand mat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Homalocenchrus angustifolius plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or degraded habitats.</p>
