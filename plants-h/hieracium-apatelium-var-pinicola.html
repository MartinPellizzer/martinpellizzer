                    <h1>Hieracium apatelium var. pinicola</h1>
<p>Hieracium apatelium var. pinicola, commonly known as the pine forest hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in open pine forests and heathlands. It has a fibrous root system and is relatively short-lived, typically surviving for about 2 to 3 years.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
