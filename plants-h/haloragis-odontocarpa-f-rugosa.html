                    <h1>Haloragis odontocarpa f. rugosa</h1>
<p>Haloragis odontocarpa f. rugosa, commonly known as the rough-leaved water starwort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, rough-textured leaves that are often submerged or floating. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically emerging from the water's surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving water, such as ponds and lakes, and is often found in nutrient-rich substrates.</p>
<p>Its morphology is adapted to aquatic life, with specialized structures for buoyancy and nutrient absorption.</p>
