<p>Hieracium juranum subsp.</p>
<p>prenanthopsis, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate leaves and tall, branched flowering stems that bear yellow disk flowers surrounded by pale yellow to white ray florets.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in association with other alpine flora.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
