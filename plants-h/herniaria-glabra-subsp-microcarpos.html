<p>Herniaria glabra subsp.</p>
<p>microcarpos, commonly known as the smooth bladderwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces tiny, white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves contain specialized cells called bladders, which are used to trap and digest small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well adapted to harsh environments, making it a resilient and ecologically significant species in its habitat.</p>
