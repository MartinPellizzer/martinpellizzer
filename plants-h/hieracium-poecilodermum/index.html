<p>Hieracium poecilodermum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the dandelion family, Asteraceae, and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy stems. This plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges. Its distinctive appearance and ecological role make it a notable species in botanical studies. Despite its beauty, it can be invasive in certain regions, posing challenges for local ecosystems.</p>
