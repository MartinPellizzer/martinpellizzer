                    <h1>Hoya compacta</h1>
<p>Hoya compacta, commonly known as the wax plant or compact hoya, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate, with a glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, waxy flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, often blooming during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Hoya compacta is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal.</p>
