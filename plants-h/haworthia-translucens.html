                <h1>Haworthia translucens</h1>
<p>Haworthia translucens, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, evergreen succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically pale green with distinct white or translucent markings. The leaves are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss and protects against intense sunlight. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months.</p>
<p>This plant is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its low maintenance and unique appearance.</p>
