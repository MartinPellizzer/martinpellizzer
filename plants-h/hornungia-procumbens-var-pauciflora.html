                    <h1>Hornungia procumbens var. pauciflora</h1>
<p>Hornungia procumbens var. pauciflora, commonly known as the low-growing hornungia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths close to the ground, with small, clustered flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has narrow, fleshy leaves that are adapted to withstand cold temperatures and nutrient-poor soils. It is often found in tundra and alpine environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics reflect its evolutionary adaptation to harsh, polar climates.</p>
