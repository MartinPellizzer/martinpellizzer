<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, adapting well to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss.</p>
