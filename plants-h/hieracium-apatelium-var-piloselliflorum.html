<p>Hieracium apatelium var. piloselliflorum, commonly known as the silkyleaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, exhibiting a rosette of basal leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a single head, which are surrounded by pale green, leaf-like bracts. Its leaves are linear to lanceolate, with a rough texture and often bear a woolly coating.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its unique floral structure and dense pubescence, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>
