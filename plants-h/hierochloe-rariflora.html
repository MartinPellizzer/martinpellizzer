                    <h1>Hierochloe rariflora</h1>
<p>Hierochloe rariflora, commonly known as the rare feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It features slender, wiry stems and fine, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of short, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Hierochloe rariflora thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical and ecological studies.</p>
