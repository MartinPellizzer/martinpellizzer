                    <h1>Hedysarum ovalifolium</h1>
<p>Hedysarum ovalifolium, commonly known as the oval-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves with oval-shaped leaflets and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces cylindrical, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments.</p>
<p>Hedysarum ovalifolium plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria in its root system.</p>
