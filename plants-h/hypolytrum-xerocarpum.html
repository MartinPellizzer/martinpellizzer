                    <h1>Hypolytrum xerocarpum</h1>
<p>Hypolytrum xerocarpum, commonly known as the coastal flax or beach flax, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Restionaceae family, which includes many grass-like plants adapted to harsh environments. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it withstands salt spray and strong winds. Its slender, grass-like leaves are often covered in a fine, hairy layer that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Hypolytrum xerocarpum produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue or white flowers, which bloom during the summer months.</p>
