<p>Huperzia nanlingensis, commonly known as the Nanling clubmoss, is a species of fern-like plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to China, particularly found in the Nanling Mountains region, where it thrives in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its upright, wiry stems and small, scale-like leaves that form dense clusters. Huperzia nanlingensis is characterized by its sporophylls, which are specialized leaves that bear spores, a key feature of its reproductive biology.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
