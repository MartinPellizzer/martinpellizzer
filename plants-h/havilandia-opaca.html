<p>Havilandia opaca, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the late summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it an invasive species in some areas.</p>
