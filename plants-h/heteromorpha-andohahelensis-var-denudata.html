                    <h1>Heteromorpha andohahelensis var. denudata</h1>
<p>Heteromorpha andohahelensis var. denudata, commonly known as the Madagascar star cactus, is a unique succulent native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its branched, spiny stems that resemble a star, with small, fleshy leaves arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces yellow flowers during the rainy season, which are followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
