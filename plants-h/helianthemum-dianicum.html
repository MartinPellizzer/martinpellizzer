<p>Helianthemum dianicum, commonly known as the alpine sunflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh alpine environment.</p>
<p>Helianthemum dianicum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
