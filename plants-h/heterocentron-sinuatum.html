                    <h1>Heterocentron sinuatum</h1>
<p>Heterocentron sinuatum, commonly known as the sinuous bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in Asia.</p>
<p>It possesses small, inflated bladder-like structures that trap aquatic prey such as insects and small crustaceans. The plant's leaves are typically slender and often submerged, while its stems can be either floating or rooted in the sediment. Its flowers are usually small and yellow, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Heterocentron sinuatum are adapted for both aquatic life and nutrient acquisition through predation.</p>
