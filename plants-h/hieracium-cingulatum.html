<p>Hieracium cingulatum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30â€“60 cm, with hairy stems and basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often reddish in color. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing bright yellow petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Hieracium cingulatum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it can form dense colonies due to its rhizomatous growth habit.</p>
