<p>Hieracium schmidtii subsp.</p>
<p>semirupicola, commonly known as Schmidt's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>The plant features a basal rosette of leaves and produces yellow composite flowers with ray florets. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
