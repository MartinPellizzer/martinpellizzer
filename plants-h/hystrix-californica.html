                    <h1>Hystrix californica</h1>
<p>Hystrix californica, commonly known as the California hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a rounded, hedgehog-like appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its spiky structure. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores.</p>
<p>Hystrix californica is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
