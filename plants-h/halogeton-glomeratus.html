                    <h1>Halogeton glomeratus</h1>
<p>Halogeton glomeratus, commonly known as the clustered saltbush, is a halophytic shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of greenish-yellow flowers, which are adapted to attract specific pollinators. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Halogeton glomeratus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in saline and disturbed habitats.</p>
