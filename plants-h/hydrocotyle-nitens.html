                    <h1>Hydrocotyle nitens</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle nitens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water pepper, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which are borne on slender stalks above the foliage. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in shallow water or moist soil.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle nitens is often found in marshes, stream banks, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
