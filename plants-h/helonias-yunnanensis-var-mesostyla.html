                    <h1>Helonias yunnanensis var. mesostyla</h1>
<p>Helonias yunnanensis var. mesostyla, commonly known as the Yunnan helonias, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spatulate-shaped leaves and showy, white to pale yellow spadix. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
