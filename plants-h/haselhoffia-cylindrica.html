                    <h1>Haselhoffia cylindrica</h1>
<p>Haselhoffia cylindrica, commonly known as the cylindrical clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant in the family Lepidoziaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive cylindrical stem with whorled leaves, which are often scale-like and arranged in tight spirals. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage.</p>
<p>Haselhoffia cylindrica is of interest to botanists due to its primitive features and its role in studying the evolution of early land plants.</p>
