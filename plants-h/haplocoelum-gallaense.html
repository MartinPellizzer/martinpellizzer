<p>Haplocoelum gallaense, commonly known as the Gallaese sponge or Gallaese liverwort, is a type of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, mat-forming plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure with a distinct gametophyte stage and lacks true roots, stems, and leaves. It reproduces through the production of spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia.</p>
<p>Haplocoelum gallaense is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitats.</p>
