                    <h1>Hymenophyllum integrum</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum integrum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, soft, and velvety fronds that are covered in tiny, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum integrum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens.</p>
