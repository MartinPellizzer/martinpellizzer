                    <h1>Hymenophyllum floribundum</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum floribundum, commonly known as the flowering fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, clustered spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and high air humidity to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in greenhouses and shaded gardens.</p>
