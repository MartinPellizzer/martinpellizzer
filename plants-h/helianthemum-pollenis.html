                    <h1>Helianthemum pollenis</h1>
<p>Helianthemum pollenis, commonly known as the Scottish heather, is a low-growing shrub native to the Scottish Highlands.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh, rocky habitat. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in open moorland and heathland environments.</p>
<p>Helianthemum pollenis is an important component of the local flora, supporting a variety of pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its ecosystem.</p>
