                    <h1>Hydnophytum terrestris</h1>
<p>Hydnophytum terrestris, commonly known as the ground ivy or creeping wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a unique ability to form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing its growth in nutrient-poor soils. Its rhizomatous stems allow it to spread rapidly, often forming dense mats on the ground.</p>
<p>Hydnophytum terrestris is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wetlands.</p>
