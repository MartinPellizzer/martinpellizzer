<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, and its roots are fibrous, aiding in its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils.
