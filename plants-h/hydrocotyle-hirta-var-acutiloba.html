                    <h1>Hydrocotyle hirta var. acutiloba</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle hirta var. acutiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh pennywort, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, short hairs. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, often emerging from the water's surface. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as marshes and ponds.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it an effective colonizer of disturbed aquatic sites.</p>
