<p>Hieracium glaciale subsp.</p>
<p>pullum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky areas, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its subspecies status reflects adaptations to high-altitude environments, including compact growth and frost resistance.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora.</p>
