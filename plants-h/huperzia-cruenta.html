                    <h1>Huperzia cruenta</h1>
<p>Huperzia cruenta, commonly known as the red-stemmed huperzia, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that are often reddish in color, especially when young. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in dense, stalked groups on the underside of its leaves. Huperzia cruenta is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
