<p>Hieracium nigrescens subsp.</p>
<p>involvens, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the dandelion family (Compositae). It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It has a taproot system and produces numerous flowering stems that rise from the base.</p>
<p>Its subspecies status reflects subtle differences in morphology, particularly in the structure of its leaves and flower heads.</p>
