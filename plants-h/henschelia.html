                    <h1>Henschelia</h1>
<p>Henschelia, commonly known as the mountain henshelia, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in alpine and subalpine regions, thriving in cooler, high-altitude environments. They are characterized by their finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Henschelia species often have a strong, aromatic scent, which helps attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to their limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, many species within this genus are considered rare or endangered.</p>
