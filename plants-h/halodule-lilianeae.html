<p>Halodule lilianeae, commonly known as the Liliane's shoalgrass, is a seagrass species found primarily in shallow tropical and subtropical marine environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, ribbon-like leaves and is often found growing in dense meadows on sandy or muddy substrates. This plant plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for various marine organisms. It is also an important component of the food web, supporting a wide range of herbivorous and detritivorous species.</p>
<p>Halodule lilianeae is adapted to low light conditions and can tolerate varying salinity levels, making it a resilient species in dynamic coastal habitats.</p>
