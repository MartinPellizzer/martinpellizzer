<p>Haworthia bilineata, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, evergreen succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of fleshy, bluish-green leaves with distinct white or pale yellow markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to maintain its vibrant appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
