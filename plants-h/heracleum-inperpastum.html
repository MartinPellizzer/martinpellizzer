<p>Heracleum inperpastum, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a tall, herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features large, umbrella-shaped compound leaves that can reach up to 3 feet in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in late summer, which are followed by spiky, brown seed pods. Its stems are covered in coarse hairs and have a milky sap that can cause severe skin irritation.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions.</p>
