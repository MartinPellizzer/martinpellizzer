                    <h1>Hyalis</h1>
<p>Hyalis, commonly known as the glasswort, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaranthaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in coastal areas and saline environments, where they exhibit remarkable salt tolerance. Hyalis species often have succulent stems and leaves, which help them retain water in arid or salty conditions. They produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, some of which are used in horticulture for their ornamental value and hardy nature.</p>
