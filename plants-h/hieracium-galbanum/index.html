                            <h1>Hieracium Galbanum</h1>
<p>Hieracium galbanum is a lesser-known member of the sunflower family known for its striking yellow flowers and toxic properties. Native to southern Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Despite its beauty, it contains harmful compounds that can cause skin irritation and is generally avoided by foragers. Its common name, "Devil's-bit Scabious," reflects both its appearance and its reputation. This plant serves as a reminder of the delicate balance between natural beauty and potential danger.</p>
