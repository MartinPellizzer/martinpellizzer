<p>Hypolytrum supervacuum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green, leafless stems and elongated, white or pale pink flowers that resemble orchids. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on the trunks of trees or in swampy areas. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to its fragility and habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires careful protection.</p>
