                    <h1>Helminthotheca comosa</h1>
<p>Helminthotheca comosa, commonly known as the hairy sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and its ability to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are covered in fine, hairy glands, giving it a distinctive appearance and aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>Helminthotheca comosa is often found in disturbed or open habitats, such as roadsides and coastal dunes.</p>
