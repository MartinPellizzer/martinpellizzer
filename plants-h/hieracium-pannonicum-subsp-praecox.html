<p>Hieracium pannonicum subsp.</p>
<p>praecox, commonly known as early yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in its often dry habitats.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in open grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its flowers are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence.</p>
<p>This subspecies is known for its early blooming period, usually in late spring, making it a notable early-flowering plant in its native range.</p>
