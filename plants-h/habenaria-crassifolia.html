<p>Habenaria crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved marsh orchid, is a species of orchid native to wetlands and marshy areas in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, grass-like leaves and its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, or purple. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in moist environments. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>This orchid is an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and ecological balance.</p>
