                    <h1>Hysterionica aberrans</h1>
<p>Hysterionica aberrans, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
