                    <h1>Hydnocarpus corymbosus</h1>
<p>Hydnocarpus corymbosus, commonly known as the Indian mangosteen, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that develop into woody, fleshy fruits. The fruit has a thick, segmented rind and a sweet, aromatic pulp, though it is not as commonly consumed as the mangosteen (Garcinia mangostana). The plant is also valued for its medicinal properties, with parts of the tree used in traditional remedies.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and pharmacological contexts.</p>
