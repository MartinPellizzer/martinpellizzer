<p>Hydrocharis morsus-ranae, commonly known as the frog-bit, is a floating aquatic plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It has small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 cm in diameter, which help it remain buoyant on the water's surface. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are submerged, allowing it to anchor itself in shallow water and absorb nutrients from the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Hydrocharis morsus-ranae plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for aquatic insects and small fish.</p>
