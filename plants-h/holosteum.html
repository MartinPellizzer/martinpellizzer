                    <h1>Holosteum</h1>
<p>Holosteum, commonly known as the waterwheel plant, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves that resemble the spokes of a wheel.</p>
<p>It is native to freshwater habitats in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in parts of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plant's buoyant, air-filled tissues allow it to float on the water's surface, while its submerged leaves perform photosynthesis. Holosteum is often found in still or slow-moving waters, such as ponds and marshes.</p>
<p>Its distinctive appearance and ecological role make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems.</p>
