                    <h1>Homalocarpus integerrimus</h1>
<p>Homalocarpus integerrimus, commonly known as the yellow mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in New Zealand.</p>
<p>It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually green but may turn reddish in certain conditions. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, fleshy berries that are a food source for native birds. Its root system forms haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
