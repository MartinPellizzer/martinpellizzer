<p>Holothrix cernua, commonly known as the hanging bladderwort, is a aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap air and aid in buoyancy. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its leaves are often submerged, while its reproductive structures are found at the water's surface.</p>
<p>Holothrix cernua plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water oxygenation.</p>
