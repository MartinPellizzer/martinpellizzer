<p>Herorchis sancta, commonly known as the sacred orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the surrounding soil, and it relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Herorchis sancta is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
