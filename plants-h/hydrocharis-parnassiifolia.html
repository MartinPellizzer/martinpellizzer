<p>Hydrocharis parnassiifolia, commonly known as the water clover, is a floating aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and the Americas.</p>
<p>It features delicate, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface, allowing it to remain buoyant on water surfaces. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a subtle ornamental value to ponds and water gardens. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often used in aquascaping for its aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>Hydrocharis parnassiifolia is also known for its ability to help purify water by absorbing nutrients and reducing algae growth.</p>
