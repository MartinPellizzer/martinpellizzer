<p>Hemionitis jamaicensis, commonly known as the Jamaican hemionitis, is a rare and endangered fern native to the Caribbean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that are typically bright green and have a velvety texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal areas and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
