                    <h1>Hylethale</h1>
<p>Hylethale, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, translucent greenish-white flowers. The plant lacks leaves and relies on its roots for photosynthesis, making it a hemiparasitic species. It thrives in specific wetland habitats, often found on the trunks of trees in the Florida scrub.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
