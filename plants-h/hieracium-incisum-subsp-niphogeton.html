<p>Hieracium incisum subsp.</p>
<p>niphogeton, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosettes of lanceolate, serrated leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a single terminal head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in nutrient-poor, alpine environments, often growing in rocky or grassy habitats at high elevations.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-adapted to cold, harsh climates with limited growing seasons.</p>
