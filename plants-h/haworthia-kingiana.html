<p>It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically green with white or pale blue markings, which help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white flowers on tall, slender stems during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for indoor and rock garden settings.</p>
