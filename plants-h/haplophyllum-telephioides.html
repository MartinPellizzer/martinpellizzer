<p>Haplophyllum telephioides, commonly known as the silverleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit and silvery-gray foliage, which helps it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Haplophyllum telephioides is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
