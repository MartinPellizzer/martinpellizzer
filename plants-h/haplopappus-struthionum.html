                    <h1>Haplopappus struthionum</h1>
<p>Haplopappus struthionum, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble dandelions. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming habit with hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss. Its yellow flowers bloom in the spring, and the plant produces small, dry fruits called achenes.</p>
<p>Haplopappus struthionum is adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
