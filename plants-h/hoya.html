                    <h1>Hoya</h1>
<p>Hoya, commonly known as the wax plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands. Hoya species are characterized by their thick, waxy leaves and clusters of star-shaped flowers that often bloom in shades of white, pink, or red. They are epiphytic, meaning they often grow on other plants without being parasitic.</p>
<p>Hoya plants are popular houseplants due to their low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light.</p>
