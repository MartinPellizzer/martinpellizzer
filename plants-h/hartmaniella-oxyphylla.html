<p>Hartmaniella oxyphylla, commonly known as the red-flowered rock heath, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, shrub-like species that typically grows on rocky outcrops and gravelly soils. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of bright red or orange flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Hartmaniella oxyphylla is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can withstand periods of drought.</p>
