<p>Hedysarum supinum, commonly known as the creeping vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early summer. Its trifoliate leaves consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Hedysarum supinum is often found in disturbed soils and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities.</p>
