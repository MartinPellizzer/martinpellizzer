<p>Hygrophila senegalensis, commonly known as the Senegal water hyssop, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow waters and wetlands, exhibiting a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread along the water's edge. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. Its small, white or pale blue flowers bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators.</p>
<p>Hygrophila senegalensis plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
