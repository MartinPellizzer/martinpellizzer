<p>Heteranthelium assyriacum, commonly known as the Assyrian heteranthelium, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant exhibits dimorphic flowers, with the stamens and pistils showing distinct morphological differences, which is a key feature of its genus. It is typically found in specific habitats, such as arid or semi-arid regions, where it has adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a species of conservation interest.</p>
