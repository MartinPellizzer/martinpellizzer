                    <h1>Hemionitis nealleyi</h1>
<p>Hemionitis nealleyi, commonly known as the Nealley's hemionitis, is a rare and unique fern species native to the arid regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing capsules, are typically found on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemionitis nealleyi is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
