<p>Hackelochloa porifera, commonly known as the porous moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a complex structure with distinct leaf arrangement and a network of rhizoids that anchor it to the substrate. Its spore-producing structures, called sporophytes, are often concealed beneath the leafy layers.</p>
