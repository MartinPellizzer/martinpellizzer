                    <h1>Hermione unicolor</h1>
<p>Hermione unicolor, commonly known as the single-color herb, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, single-colored petals that range from deep crimson to pale blue, depending on the variety. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down. It blooms during the late spring and early summer, producing clusters of fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and slow growth rate, Hermione unicolor is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
