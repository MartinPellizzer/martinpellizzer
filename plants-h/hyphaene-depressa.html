                    <h1>Hyphaene depressa</h1>
<p>Hyphaene depressa, commonly known as the African fan palm, is a monocotyledonous plant native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of pinnate leaves that form a fan-like shape. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with both male and female flowers, typical of palm species. Its roots form a dense network that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Hyphaene depressa is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of thatching material.</p>
