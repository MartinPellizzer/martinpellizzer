                    <h1>Heterotaxis</h1>
<p>Heterotaxis, commonly known as the "twisted stem" plant, is a unique species characterized by its spiral arrangement of leaves and branches.</p>
<p>This growth pattern is a form of phyllotaxis, where the plant's parts are arranged in a logarithmic spiral, often following the Fibonacci sequence. The botanical significance of heterotaxis lies in its efficient use of space and sunlight, allowing for optimal photosynthesis. Its stems exhibit a helical twist, which can aid in structural stability and water transport.</p>
<p>This plant is often studied for its mathematical patterns in nature and its ecological adaptations.</p>
