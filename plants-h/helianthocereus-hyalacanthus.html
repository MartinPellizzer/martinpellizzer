                    <h1>Helianthocereus hyalacanthus</h1>
<p>Helianthocereus hyalacanthus, commonly known as the glassy cactus, is a rare species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that are covered in a waxy, translucent cuticle, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, adapting to its harsh desert environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
