                    <h1>Hydnophytum keiense</h1>
<p>Hydnophytum keiense, commonly known as the African butter tree, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and Southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its unique ability to derive some of its nutrients from host plants through specialized root structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and has a distinctive, fleshy, waxy fruit that contains multiple seeds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in association with other understory vegetation in dense forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and specific habitat requirements, it plays a unique role in the ecological dynamics of its native regions.</p>
