<p>Herminium kalimpongense, commonly known as the Kalimpong lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal.</p>

The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It has a tuberous root system that helps it survive in its cool, humid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
