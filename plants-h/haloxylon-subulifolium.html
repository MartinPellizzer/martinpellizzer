                    <h1>Haloxylon subulifolium</h1>
<p>Haloxylon subulifolium, commonly known as the desert date tree, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny branches and narrow, needle-like leaves that reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, date-like fruits. It is well adapted to extreme drought conditions and plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils.</p>
<p>Haloxylon subulifolium is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of fuel and fodder in some regions.</p>
