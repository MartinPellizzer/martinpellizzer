                    <h1>Hypolaena ramosissima</h1>
<p>Hypolaena ramosissima, commonly known as the coralroot orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a mycoheterotrophic plant that obtains nutrients through its mycorrhizal associations with fungi. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in a dense spike. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and swamps.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of undisturbed forest ecosystems.</p>
