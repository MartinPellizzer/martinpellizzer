                    <h1>Herniaria virescens</h1>
<p>Herniaria virescens, commonly known as the green sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils, with small, succulent, greenish-blue leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces tiny white or pale pink flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are adapted to reduce water loss, making it well-suited for harsh, cold environments.</p>
<p>Herniaria virescens is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
