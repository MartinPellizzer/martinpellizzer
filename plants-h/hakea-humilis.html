                    <h1>Hakea humilis</h1>
<p>Hakea humilis, commonly known as the low hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. It is well-suited for coastal and sandy soils due to its drought tolerance and salt resistance.</p>
<p>Hakea humilis is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits to local wildlife.</p>
