                    <h1>Hypericum vulcanicum</h1>
<p>Hypericum vulcanicum, commonly known as the volcanic St. John's wort, is a rare and unique plant native to the volcanic regions of Italy.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers and holly-like leaves, which are typically covered in fine hairs. This species thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or volcanic substrates. Its medicinal properties are similar to those of other Hypericum species, though it is less commonly used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
<p>The plant plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its native habitat, supporting specific pollinators and contributing to biodiversity.</p>
