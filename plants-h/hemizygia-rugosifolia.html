<p>Hemizygia rugosifolia, commonly known as the rough-leaved hemizygia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, rugged, and often hairy leaves that are arranged in opposite pairs along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in the spring. Hemizygia rugosifolia thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert landscapes.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and adaptation to harsh climates make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
