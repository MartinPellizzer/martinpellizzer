<p>Hoya parasitica var. spirei, commonly known as the spiral hoya, is a rare and unique epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive spiraling growth pattern, which gives it its common name. The plant produces waxy, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, often blooming during the summer months. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, it is a parasitic species, deriving some of its nutrients from host plants.</p>
