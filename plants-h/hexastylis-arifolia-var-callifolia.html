                    <h1>Hexastylis arifolia var. callifolia</h1>
<p>Hexastylis arifolia var. callifolia, commonly known as the showy heartleaf, is a perennial fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features delicate, heart-shaped leaves that are often adorned with a waxy bloom, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, or sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of ferns.</p>
