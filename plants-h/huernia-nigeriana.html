                    <h1>Huernia nigeriana</h1>
<p>Huernia nigeriana, commonly known as the Blackfooted African Cactus, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, spiny structures, and it has a distinctive, almost coral-like appearance.</p>
<p>Huernia nigeriana is well-suited for rock gardens and dry environments due to its drought tolerance.</p>
