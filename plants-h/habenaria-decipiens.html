<p>Habenaria decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that resemble those of other orchid species, a trait that may aid in pollination. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, and the flowers are usually pink or purple in color.</p>
<p>The orchid's unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
