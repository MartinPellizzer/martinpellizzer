                    <h1>Hymenophyllum acrosorum</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum acrosorum, commonly known as the acrosorine fern, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are covered with a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its unique botanical appearance.</p>
