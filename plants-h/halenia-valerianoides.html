                    <h1>Halenia valerianoides</h1>
<p>Halenia valerianoides, commonly known as the lesser valerian, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white or greenish-white flowers. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. The plant has a strong, often disagreeable odor, similar to that of valerian, which is due to the presence of volatile compounds.</p>
<p>It is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>
