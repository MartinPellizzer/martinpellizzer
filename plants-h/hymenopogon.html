<p>Hymenopogon, commonly known as the beard grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and the presence of hairy structures, particularly on the stems and leaves. The plants typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, spike-like inflorescences. Hymenopogon species are often found in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>They play a role in stabilizing soil and are sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
