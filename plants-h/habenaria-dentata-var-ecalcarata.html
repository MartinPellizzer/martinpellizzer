<p>Habenaria dentata var. ecalcarata, commonly known as the toothed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with distinctive tooth-like projections on the petals and sepals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
