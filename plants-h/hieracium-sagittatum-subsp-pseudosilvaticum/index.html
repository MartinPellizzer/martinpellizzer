                            <h1>Hieracium Sagittatum Subsp. Pseudosilvaticum</h1>
<p>Hieracium sagittatum subsp. pseudosilvaticum is a lesser-known member of the dandelion family known for its unique leaf shapes and striking yellow flowers. This subspecies thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodland edges and rocky areas. Its foliage is lance-shaped with a distinctive serrated edge, making it easily identifiable in the wild. While not as common as other hawkweeds, it plays an important role in supporting local pollinators. Despite its modest appearance, this plant offers valuable insights into ecological adaptation and biodiversity.</p>
