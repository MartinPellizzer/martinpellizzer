<p>Heracleum thomsonii var. glabrius, commonly known as the Thomson's hogweed, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, umbrella-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>It is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and riverbanks. The plant has large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and a distinctive, unpleasant odor. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the carrot family.</p>
<p>Due to its potential to cause photodermatitis, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions.</p>
