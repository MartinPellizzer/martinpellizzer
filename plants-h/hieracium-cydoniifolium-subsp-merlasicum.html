<p>Hieracium cydoniifolium subsp.</p>
<p>merlasicum, commonly known as the Merlasiacum hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its basal rosette of elongated, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often growing in open, sunny habitats. It has a taproot system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution.</p>
