<p>Hypolepis papuana, commonly known as the Papuan water fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Islands, particularly Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that resemble those of other water ferns. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and swampy areas. Its rhizomes are often submerged, allowing it to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
