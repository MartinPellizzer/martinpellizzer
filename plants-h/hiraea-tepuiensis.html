                    <h1>Hiraea tepuiensis</h1>
<p>Hiraea tepuiensis, commonly known as the tepui hiraea, is a rare flowering plant native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Colombia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, high-altitude environments, thriving in the unique microclimates of the tepuis. Its leaves are usually small and elliptical, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
