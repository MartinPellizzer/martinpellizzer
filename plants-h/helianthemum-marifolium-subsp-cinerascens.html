<p>Helianthemum marifolium subsp.</p>
<p>cinerascens, commonly known as the silverleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems.</p>
<p>The leaves are characterized by their silvery-gray color due to dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in garden settings.</p>
