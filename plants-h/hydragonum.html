                    <h1>Hydragonum</h1>
<p>Hydragonum, commonly known as the dragon's breath plant, is a unique species characterized by its striking, flame-like foliage.</p>
<p>It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. The plant's leaves are thick and waxy, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. It produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of red and orange, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, Hydragonum is toxic to humans and animals if ingested, making it a plant to admire from a distance.</p>
