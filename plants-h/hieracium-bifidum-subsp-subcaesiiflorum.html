<p>Hieracium bifidum subsp.</p>
<p>subcaesiiflorum, commonly known as the purpleflower devil's-bit manroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems and yellow to orange flowers.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its pale purple to pinkish flower heads, which are more vibrant than those of the typical H. bifidum. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant's leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often have a rough texture, contributing to its robust appearance.</p>
