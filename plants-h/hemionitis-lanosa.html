                    <h1>Hemionitis lanosa</h1>
<p>Hemionitis lanosa, commonly known as the woolly hemionitis, is a rare and unique fern native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, densely hairy fronds that give it a soft, woolly appearance. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Hemionitis lanosa is considered a sensitive indicator species for ecological health.</p>
