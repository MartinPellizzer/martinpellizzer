<p>Habenaria chloroleuca var. ovata, commonly known as the oval-leaf marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in eastern North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows to a height of 15â€“30 cm, featuring lance-shaped, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of pale green to yellowish flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip, which is a characteristic feature of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
