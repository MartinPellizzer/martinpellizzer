<p>Habenaria aggregata, commonly known as the clustered sail orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a sympodial growth habit with a rhizome and multiple pseudobulbs, each bearing a single leaf. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers with prominent yellow sepals and petals. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as forest floors and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its humid, low-light environment.</p>
