<p>Hieracium lawsonii subsp.</p>
<p>flocciramum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads.</p>
<p>The plant features a basal rosette of soft, woolly, and often silver-gray leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers are typically yellow with a central disk, and it produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows.</p>
