                    <h1>Helichrysum pagophilum</h1>
<p>Helichrysum pagophilum, commonly known as the Antarctic immortelle, is a flowering plant native to the extreme environments of Antarctica and the southern regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in cold, arid conditions, often found on rocky soils and coastal areas. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a splash of color to its harsh habitat. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its cold, dry environment.</p>
<p>Helichrysum pagophilum is also noted for its ability to survive extreme temperatures and is considered a symbol of resilience in harsh climates.</p>
