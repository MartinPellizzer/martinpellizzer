                    <h1>Halimus portulacoides</h1>
<p>Halimus portulacoides, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a small, mat-forming succulent native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It has fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that store water, adapting to its harsh, dry environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to absorb moisture from the surface layer of the soil.</p>
<p>Halimus portulacoides is well-suited for xeriscaping and is often used in drought-tolerant landscaping.</p>
