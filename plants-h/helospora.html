                    <h1>Helospora</h1>
<p>Helospora, commonly known as the "ghost fern," is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic ferns belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their delicate, feathery fronds that often resemble ghostly shapes, hence their common name. Helospora species typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks, wetlands, and rocky crevices. Their spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in distinctive patterns on the undersides of their fronds.</p>
<p>The genus is notable for its unique adaptations to aquatic habitats, including specialized root systems and reduced leaf structures.</p>
