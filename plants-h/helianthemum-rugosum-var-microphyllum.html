                    <h1>Helianthemum rugosum var. microphyllum</h1>
<p>Helianthemum rugosum var. microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved rock rose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features compact, gray-green foliage with small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardy nature and ornamental value.</p>
