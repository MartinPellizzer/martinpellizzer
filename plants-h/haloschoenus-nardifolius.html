<p>Haloschoenus nardifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved saltbush, is a shrub native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant thrives in saline and arid environments, making it well adapted to coastal and inland areas with poor soil conditions. Its flowering stems produce small, yellowish-green flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.</p>
