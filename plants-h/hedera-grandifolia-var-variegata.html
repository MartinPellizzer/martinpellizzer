                    <h1>Hedera grandifolia var. variegata</h1>
<p>Hedera grandifolia var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated English ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to western and central Europe.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves with striking white and yellow variegation, which adds ornamental value to gardens and indoor spaces. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for vertical gardening and ground cover.</p>
<p>However, its invasive potential requires careful management in natural habitats.</p>
