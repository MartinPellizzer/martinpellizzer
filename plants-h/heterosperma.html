                    <h1>Heterosperma</h1>
<p>Heterosperma, commonly known as water shield, is a genus of aquatic plants characterized by its floating leaves and root-like structures called rhizomes.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are broad and flat, often with a waxy surface to reduce water loss, and they float on the water's surface. Heterosperma produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually submerged or partially submerged, and its seeds are dispersed by water currents.</p>
<p>This plant plays a role in stabilizing water ecosystems and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
