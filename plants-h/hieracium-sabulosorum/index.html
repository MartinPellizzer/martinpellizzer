                            <h1>Hieracium Sabulosorum</h1>
<p>Hieracium sabulosorum is a unique species of dandelion found primarily in coastal and sandy habitats. It is known for its hairy stems and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often seen along shores and dunes. Its scientific name reflects its association with sandy environments. Despite its common name, it is not widely known outside of botanical circles.</p>
