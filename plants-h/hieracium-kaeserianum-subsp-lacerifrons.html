<p>Hieracium kaeserianum subsp.</p>
<p>lacerifrons, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and slopes at elevations above 1,500 meters.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to harsh climatic conditions and its role in supporting local pollinator populations.</p>
