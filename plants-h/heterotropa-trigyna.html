<p>Heterotropa trigyna, commonly known as the three-lobed bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which it uses to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters and is often found in moist, nutrient-rich environments. Its leaves are usually simple and may have three lobes, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>Heterotropa trigyna is a carnivorous plant, relying on both photosynthesis and the nutrients obtained from captured prey.</p>
