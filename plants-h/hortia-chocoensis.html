                    <h1>Hortia chocoensis</h1>
<p>Hortia chocoensis, commonly known as the Choc√≥ hortia, is a rare and unique plant native to the rainforests of Colombia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic plants. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of bromeliads. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and protection from intense sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
