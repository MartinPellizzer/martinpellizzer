                    <h1>Herniaria hirsuta var. hispida</h1>
<p>Herniaria hirsuta var. hispida, commonly known as the hairy herniaria, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, succulent leaves that are densely covered with fine, hairy trichomes, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically on short, erect stems. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to stabilize loose, sandy soils.</p>
<p>This species is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
