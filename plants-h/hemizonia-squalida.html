<p>Hemizonia squalida, commonly known as the desert evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its root system is adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Hemizonia squalida plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing food for desert wildlife.</p>
