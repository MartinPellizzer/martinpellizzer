                <h1>Hallieracantha hallieri</h1>
<p>Hallieracantha hallieri, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It attaches to the branches of host trees, such as rimu and tawa, through its haustoria to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are pollinated by insects. Its berries are red and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Hallieracantha hallieri plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native forests, though it is considered a potential weed in some regions.</p>
