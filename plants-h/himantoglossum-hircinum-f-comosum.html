                    <h1>Himantoglossum hircinum f. comosum</h1>
<p>Himantoglossum hircinum f. comosum, commonly known as the hairy tongue orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, hairy-textured leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils, often in open woodland or alpine environments. It is a perennial herb that forms a rosette of basal leaves, with the flowering stems emerging from the center.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
