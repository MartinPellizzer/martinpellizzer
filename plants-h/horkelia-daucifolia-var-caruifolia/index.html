<p>Horkelia daucifolia var. caruifolia is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the western united states. it belongs to the apiaceae family, known for its carroty or parsley-like appearance. this variety is distinguished by its finely divided leaves and small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in early spring. it thrives in rocky soils and sunny exposures, often found in alpine and arid environments. due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring careful conservation efforts.</p>
