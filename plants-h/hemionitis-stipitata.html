                    <h1>Hemionitis stipitata</h1>
<p>Hemionitis stipitata, commonly known as the water fern, is a unique aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Hemionitis stipitata is also known for its ability to absorb heavy metals, making it useful in phytoremediation efforts.</p>
