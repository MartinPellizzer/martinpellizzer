                    <h1>Halenia subinvolucrata</h1>
<p>Halenia subinvolucrata, commonly known as the slender halenia, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands and marshes of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in a loose cluster, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in moist soils.</p>
<p>Halenia subinvolucrata is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat.</p>
