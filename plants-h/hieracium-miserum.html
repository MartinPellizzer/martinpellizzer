                    <h1>Hieracium miserum</h1>
<p>Hieracium miserum, commonly known as the meadow hawkweed, is a species of flowering plant in the daisy family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellowish-green flowers and hairy leaves, which are often mistaken for dandelions. Native to Europe, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including North America, where it can become invasive in certain habitats. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and meadows, and can form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a potential weed in agricultural settings.</p>
