                    <h1>Hedraiostylus corniculatus</h1>
<p>Hedraiostylus corniculatus, commonly known as the horned style orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a prominently horn-like projection on the column, which is a distinctive botanical trait. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with intricate patterns of petals and sepals that contribute to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
