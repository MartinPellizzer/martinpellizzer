<p>Helianthemum viscidulum subsp.</p>
<p>raynaudii, commonly known as the Raynaud's sandthrift, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a sticky resin, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, adding a splash of color to rocky or sandy soils. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it well-suited for Mediterranean climates.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover in dry landscapes.</p>
