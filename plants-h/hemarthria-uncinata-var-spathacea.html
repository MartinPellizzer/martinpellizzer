<p>Hemarthria uncinata var. spathacea, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, hairless blades and compact inflorescences that produce small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and wetlands, and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>The species is also valued for its potential in erosion control and as a forage crop for livestock.</p>
