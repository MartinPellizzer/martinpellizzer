                    <h1>Holcus nervosus</h1>
<p>Holcus nervosus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with prominent veins. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and fields. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear颖果, which are dry, one-seeded fruits.</p>
<p>Holcus nervosus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
