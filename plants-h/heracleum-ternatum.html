                    <h1>Heracleum ternatum</h1>
<p>Heracleum ternatum, commonly known as cow parsnip, is a tall biennial or perennial plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It features a robust stem with distinctive, hairy leaves that are deeply lobed and resemble those of parsley. The plant produces umbrella-shaped clusters of small white flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
<p>However, it contains toxic sap that can cause skin irritation, so caution is advised when handling it.</p>
