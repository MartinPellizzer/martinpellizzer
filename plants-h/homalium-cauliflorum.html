                    <h1>Homalium cauliflorum</h1>
<p>Homalium cauliflorum, commonly known as the red-flowered hollies, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bright red flowers that appear in clusters, often on the trunk and branches, a trait known as cauliflorism. The plant has glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green and provide a striking contrast to its vibrant blooms. It produces small, orange-red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans.</p>
<p>Homalium cauliflorum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, tropical climates.</p>
