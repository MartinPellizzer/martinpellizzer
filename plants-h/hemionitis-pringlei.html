                    <h1>Hemionitis pringlei</h1>
<p>Hemionitis pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's hemionitis, is a rare and endangered fern native to the arid regions of central China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in rocky, limestone-rich soils and requires a specific microhabitat with high humidity and cool temperatures. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Hemionitis pringlei is critically endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts to prevent its extinction.</p>
