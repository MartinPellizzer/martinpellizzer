                    <h1>Halogeton glomeratus var. tibeticus</h1>
<p>Halogeton glomeratus var. tibeticus, commonly known as the Tibetan saltbush, is a halophyte native to the arid regions of Tibet.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and arid environments, demonstrating remarkable tolerance to high salinity and extreme temperatures. The plant produces small, clustered green or pale yellow flowers, which are typically inconspicuous and adapted for pollination by wind or insects. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, storing water to help it survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is particularly valuable for ecological restoration in degraded and saline soils.</p>
