<p>Hypobathrum ellipticum, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in desert or semi-desert environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and elliptical, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Hypobathrum ellipticum is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can withstand extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
