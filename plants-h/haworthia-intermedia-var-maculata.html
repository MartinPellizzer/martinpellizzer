                    <h1>Haworthia intermedia var. maculata</h1>
<p>Haworthia intermedia var. maculata, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically green with white or cream-colored markings resembling a zebra's stripes. The leaves are covered in a layer of fine, white, powdery bloom, which helps reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. It produces small, tubular flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the spring and summer months.</p>
<p>This plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light.</p>
