<p>Hordeum jubatum subsp.</p>
<p>intermedium, commonly known as intermediate wild barley, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as fields, roadsides, and disturbed soils, often forming dense tufts with slender, wiry stems.</p>
<p>The plant produces spikelets that are usually borne in clusters, with lemmas that are often hairy and the glumes that are shorter than the lemma. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it is known for its adaptability to various environmental conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest in agricultural and ecological studies due to its potential as a forage crop and its role in plant evolution.</p>
