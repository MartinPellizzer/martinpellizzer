<p>Habenaria diptera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant features long, slender stems with oval-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish or pale yellow flowers clustered in a spike. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ornamental appeal in botanical gardens.</p>
