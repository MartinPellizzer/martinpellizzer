                    <h1>Hohenbergia urbaniana</h1>
<p>Hohenbergia urbaniana, commonly known as the silver rosette, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped foliage that forms a dense, silver-green appearance. The leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. It produces striking, showy inflorescences with bright red bracts that emerge from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>This plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal.</p>
