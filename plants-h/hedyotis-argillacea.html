                    <h1>Hedyotis argillacea</h1>
<p>Hedyotis argillacea, commonly known as the clay plant or dwarf blushing grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to moist, clay-rich soils in temperate regions.</p>
<p>It features small, clustered leaves that are typically glaucous or hairy, and it produces tiny, white or pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments, such as woodland edges or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil in wet areas.</p>
<p>Hedyotis argillacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local insect populations.</p>
