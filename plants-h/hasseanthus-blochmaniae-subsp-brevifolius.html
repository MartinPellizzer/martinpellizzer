<p>Hasseanthus blochmaniae subsp.</p>
<p>brevifolius, commonly known as the short-leaved star cactus, is a succulent plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its compact, branching structure and small, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a slight bluish tint.</p>
