<p>Hirculus, commonly known as the goat willow, is a species of flowering plant in the Salicaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in early spring. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found growing near streams and in moist woodlands. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, with a soft, velvety texture.</p>
<p>Hirculus plays a role in supporting local insect populations, particularly moths, due to its early blooming habit.</p>
