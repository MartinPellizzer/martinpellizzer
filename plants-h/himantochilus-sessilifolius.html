                    <h1>Himantochilus sessilifolius</h1>
<p>Himantochilus sessilifolius, commonly known as the sessile-leaved sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and simple, elliptical leaves that are sessile, meaning they lack a petiole. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, aromatic fruits. It is valued for its timber, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of sandalwood oil.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species.</p>
