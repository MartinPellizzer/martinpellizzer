<p>Hedysarum fruticosum subsp.</p>
<p>lignosum, commonly known as the shrub vetch, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically hairy and have a distinctive scent.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
