<p>Hieracium glaucophyllum subsp.</p>
<p>villadraeum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble single blooms.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in a dense layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>The flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
