                    <h1>Hypselodelphys lopei</h1>
<p>Hypselodelphys lopei, commonly known as the Lop√© mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It attaches to the branches of host trees, such as those in the genus *Chloroxylon*, using specialized haustoria to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous appearance. Its berries, which are typically red or yellow, are an important food source for birds and other wildlife.</p>
<p>The species plays a significant ecological role in its habitat by influencing host tree growth and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
