<p>Haitiella, commonly known as the Haitian orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the Caribbean, particularly Haiti, where it thrives in humid, tropical environments. The plants are characterized by their delicate, showy flowers that often feature intricate patterns and vibrant colors. Haitiella species typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, attaching themselves to trees or rocks in their natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and overharvesting, many species within this genus are now threatened with extinction.</p>
