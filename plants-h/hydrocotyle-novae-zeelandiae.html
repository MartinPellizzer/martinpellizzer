                    <h1>Hydrocotyle novae-zeelandiae</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle novae-zeelandiae, commonly known as New Zealand water shield, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. The plant has floating leaves that are heart-shaped with a waxy surface, and it produces small, white flowers that bloom from spring to autumn. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats on the water's surface.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle novae-zeelandiae plays a role in stabilizing water bodies and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
