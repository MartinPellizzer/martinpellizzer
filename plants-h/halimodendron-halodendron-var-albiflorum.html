                    <h1>Halimodendron halodendron var. albiflorum</h1>
<p>Halimodendron halodendron var. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered halimodendron, is a succulent shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, storing water in its thick stems and leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its striking contrast of white blooms against its foliage.</p>
