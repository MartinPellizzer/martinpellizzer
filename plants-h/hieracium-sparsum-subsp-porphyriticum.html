<p>Hieracium sparsum subsp.</p>
<p>porphyriticum, commonly known as the porphyritic hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and flowering heads that produce yellow or orange composite flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It has a taproot system and produces rhizomes that help it spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The leaves are usually hairy and have a rough texture, which helps in reducing water loss in its often dry environments.</p>
