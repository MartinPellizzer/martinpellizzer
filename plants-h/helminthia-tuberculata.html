<p>Helminthia tuberculata, commonly known as the roughleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor it in loose, sandy soils.</p>
<p>Helminthia tuberculata is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, gravelly slopes, and dry fields.</p>
