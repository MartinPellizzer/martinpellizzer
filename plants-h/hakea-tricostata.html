                    <h1>Hakea tricostata</h1>
<p>Hakea tricostata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is an evergreen shrub native to southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually grey-green in color and covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces cylindrical, yellowish flower spikes that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody structure and adaptability to dry conditions make it well-suited for coastal and sandy soils.</p>
<p>Hakea tricostata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in arid environments.</p>
