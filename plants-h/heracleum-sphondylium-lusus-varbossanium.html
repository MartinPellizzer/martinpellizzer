                    <h1>Heracleum sphondylium lusus varbossanium</h1>
<p>Heracleum sphondylium lusus varbossanium, commonly known as the clustered cow parsley, is a variant of the cow parsley species native to southern Europe.</p>
<p>It is a biennial or perennial herb that typically grows in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant features a tall, hollow stem with finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its fruit is a dry, two-lobed achene, and it is often found in moist, calcareous soils.</p>
<p>Due to its similarity to other toxic lookalikes, it is important to correctly identify this plant to avoid confusion with more hazardous species.</p>
