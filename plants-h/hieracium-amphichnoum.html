<p>Hieracium amphichnoum, commonly known as the bog buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in peat bogs and other moist, acidic environments, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils. The plant features a rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and produces small, yellow flowers with five petals. It is characterized by its ability to survive in waterlogged conditions due to its specialized root system.</p>
<p>Hieracium amphichnoum is often found in association with other bog flora, contributing to the ecological diversity of these unique ecosystems.</p>
