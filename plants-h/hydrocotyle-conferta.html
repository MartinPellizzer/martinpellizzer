<p>Hydrocotyle conferta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water shield, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant features small, rounded leaves that are often floating or partially submerged, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Its flowers are small and yellow, appearing in clusters, and it produces small, round fruits that disperse by water.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle conferta plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for invertebrates and serving as a food source for waterfowl.</p>
