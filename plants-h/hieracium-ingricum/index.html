                            <h1>Hieracium Ingricum</h1>
<p>Hieracium ingricum, commonly known as the northern hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and grasslands, often colonizing disturbed areas. The plant is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Despite its beauty, it is considered a weed in some areas due to its aggressive spreading habit.</p>
