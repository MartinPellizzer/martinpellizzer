                    <h1>Helophytum natans var. minus</h1>
<p>Helophytum natans var. minus, commonly known as the floating bladderwort, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, inflated leaves that float on the water's surface, which help it stay afloat and trap small organisms. The plant is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, with a distinctive spurred structure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
