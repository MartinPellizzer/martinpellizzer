                            <h1>Herniaria Cinerea Var. Diandra</h1>
<p>Cineraria, scientifically known as Herniaria cinerea var. diandra, is a low-growing, flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale blue. This resilient plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry, sunny habitats. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Despite its delicate look, Cineraria is remarkably drought-tolerant and easy to care for, making it an excellent addition to any garden.</p>
