                    <h1>Hymenophyllum pleiocarpum</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum pleiocarpum, commonly known as the many-fruited hymenophyllum, is a small, evergreen fern that belongs to the Hymenophyllaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called soruses, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum pleiocarpum is notable for its ability to retain moisture, which is essential for its survival in humid, forested habitats.</p>
