                    <h1>Hormidium virens</h1>
<p>Hormidium virens, commonly known as the green hormidium, is a species of liverwort that belongs to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is a non-vascular plant characterized by its simple, leaf-like structures called thallus, which are typically green and closely clustered. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Hormidium virens reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its thallus.</p>
<p>Its growth is slow, and it plays a minor but ecologically significant role in nutrient cycling within its habitat.</p>
