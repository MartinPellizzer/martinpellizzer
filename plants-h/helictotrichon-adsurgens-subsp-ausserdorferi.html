<p>Helictotrichon adsurgens subsp.</p>
<p>ausserdorferi, commonly known as the mountain bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the high elevations of the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that often form dense mats.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous pale blue to purple florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions.</p>
