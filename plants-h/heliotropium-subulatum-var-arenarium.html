                    <h1>Heliotropium subulatum var. arenarium</h1>
<p>Heliotropium subulatum var. arenarium, commonly known as sand heliotrope, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to violet, often resembling those of the common heliotrope. The plant has finely serrated, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and adaptability make it an important species in ecological restoration projects.</p>
