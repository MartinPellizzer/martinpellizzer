                    <h1>Hydnophytum dipteropodum</h1>
<p>Hydnophytum dipteropodum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a unique epiphytic plant found in the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, relying on its symbiotic relationship with specific fungi for nutrients. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the canopy of trees. Its roots are specialized to form mycorrhizal associations, enabling it to absorb nutrients from decaying organic matter.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
