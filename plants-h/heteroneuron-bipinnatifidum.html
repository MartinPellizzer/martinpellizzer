<p>Heteroneuron bipinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnatifid leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The fronds are usually light green and can vary in length depending on environmental conditions.</p>
