                    <h1>Hakea orthorrhyncha</h1>
<p>Hakea orthorrhyncha, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to south-western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces cylindrical, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody stems are covered in a thick layer of bark, which helps it survive in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Hakea orthorrhyncha is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands.</p>
