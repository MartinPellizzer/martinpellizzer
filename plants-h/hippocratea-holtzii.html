<p>Hippocratea holtzii, commonly known as the Sierra Madre cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is classified as critically endangered.</p>
