<p>Hibiscus fusiformis, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to red, with a distinctive bilabiate structure. The plant has thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to conserve water, making it well-suited for harsh, dry environments. Its flowers bloom in late summer and early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Hibiscus fusiformis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
