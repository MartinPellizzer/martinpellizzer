                    <h1>Hemizonia pungens var. septentrionalis</h1>
<p>Hemizonia pungens var. septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern prickly zizyphus, is a shrub native to the arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to harsh, semi-desert environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of interest in plant taxonomy.</p>
