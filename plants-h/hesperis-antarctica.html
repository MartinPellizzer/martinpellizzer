<p>Hesperis antarctica, commonly known as the Antarctic bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of Antarctica and southern South America.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has adapted to extreme environmental conditions, including harsh winds and nutrient-poor soil. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Hesperis antarctica plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
