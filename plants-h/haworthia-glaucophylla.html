                    <h1>Haworthia glaucophylla</h1>
<p>Haworthia glaucophylla, commonly known as the blue haworthia, is a compact, evergreen succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
