<p>Hymenophyllum brasilianum, commonly known as the Brazilian spore moss, is a member of the Hymenophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like appearance.</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic moss that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has finely divided, often overlapping leaves that are covered in a dense layer of rhizoids, which help anchor it to its substrate. Its reproductive structures, called sporophytes, are small and inconspicuous, producing spores that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum brasilianum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in high humidity and indirect light.</p>
