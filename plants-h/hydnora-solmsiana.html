                    <h1>Hydnora solmsiana</h1>
<p>Hydnora solmsiana, commonly known as the devil's flower, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Hydnoraceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of woody plants. The plant is notable for its unique, fleshy, and often foul-smelling flowers that emit a strong odor to attract pollinators like flies. Its flowers are usually unisexual, with separate male and female structures.</p>
<p>Hydnora solmsiana is native to southern Africa and is considered a rare and specialized species due to its parasitic nature and specific ecological requirements.</p>
