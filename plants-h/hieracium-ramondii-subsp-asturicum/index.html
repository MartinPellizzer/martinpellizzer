                            <h1>Hieracium Ramondii Subsp. Asturicum</h1>
<p>Asturian hawkweed, scientifically known as Hieracium ramondii subsp. asturicum, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the mountainous regions of Asturias in northern Spain. This subspecies belongs to the dandelion family, characterized by its hairy stems and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in rocky and acidic soils, often found in open habitats such as slopes and meadows. Due to habitat loss and human activity, it faces significant conservation challenges. Protecting this unique species is crucial for preserving the biodiversity of its native region.</p>
