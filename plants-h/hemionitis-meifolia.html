                    <h1>Hemionitis meifolia</h1>
<p>Hemionitis meifolia, commonly known as the white-flowered hemionitis, is a rare and delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, silver-green fronds that are adorned with small, white spore-bearing structures called sori. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Hemionitis meifolia is considered endangered in its natural range.</p>
