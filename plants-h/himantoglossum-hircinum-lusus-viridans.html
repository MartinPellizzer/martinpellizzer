                    <h1>Himantoglossum hircinum lusus viridans</h1>
<p>Himantoglossum hircinum lusus viridans, commonly known as the green-horned orchid, is a rare and specialized member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique greenish-yellow floral structure, which is distinct from the typical orchid colors. This plant typically grows in specific alpine or subalpine habitats, often in rocky or gravelly soils. It is found in limited regions across Europe, particularly in the Carpathian Mountains.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
