<p>Hieracium dermophyllum subsp.</p>
<p>juraniforme, commonly known as the Jura Hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Alps and surrounding regions. It is characterized by its rosette-like growth habit and distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically basal, with a woolly or hairy texture, and the plant produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. It thrives in rocky or alpine meadows, often growing in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the genus Hieracium.</p>
