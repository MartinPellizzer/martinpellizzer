                    <h1>Hormidium pseudopygmaeum</h1>
<p>Hormidium pseudopygmaeum, commonly known as the miniature horned lichen, is a small, crustose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its intricate, branched thallus with a yellowish to orange-brown coloration. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and cyanobacteria, which provide essential nutrients through photosynthesis. It is typically found on bark, stone, or soil in temperate forests.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and cryptic appearance, it is often overlooked but plays a vital role in ecological nutrient cycling.</p>
