<p>Haplopappus phyllocephalus subsp.</p>
<p>primitivus, commonly known as the desert groundsel, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is a low-growing perennial with gray-green, silver-hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in a pappus, a feathery structure that aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to thrive in poor soils and extreme temperatures, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems.</p>
