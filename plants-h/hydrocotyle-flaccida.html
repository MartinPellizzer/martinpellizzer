                    <h1>Hydrocotyle flaccida</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle flaccida, commonly known as the marsh pennywort, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of broad, arrow-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, depending on the water level. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in moist soils and shallow water.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle flaccida plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
