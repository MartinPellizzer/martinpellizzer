                    <h1>Helogyne straminea</h1>
<p>Helogyne straminea, commonly known as the yellow heliconia, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Heliconiaceae family and is characterized by its large, brightly colored inflorescences that resemble a cluster of hands, hence its common name. The plant features broad, waxy, strap-like leaves that are typically green with a prominent midrib. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their bright coloration and nectar-rich structure.</p>
<p>Helogyne straminea is often cultivated for its ornamental value in warm climates and is used in both horticulture and traditional medicine.</p>
