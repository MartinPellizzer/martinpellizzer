<p>Hylodesmum leptopus, commonly known as the slender rock-moss, is a small, terrestrial liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leaf-like structures called thallus. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in damp soil, forming dense, low-growing mats. Its reproductive structures, known as gemmae, are produced in specialized clusters called gemma cups.</p>
<p>Hylodesmum leptopus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates.</p>
