                    <h1>Hesperidopsis brevipes</h1>
<p>Hesperidopsis brevipes, commonly known as the shortfooted hesperidopsis, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit with hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming during the spring and early summer. Hesperidopsis brevipes is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
