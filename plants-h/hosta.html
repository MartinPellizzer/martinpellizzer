<p>Hosta, commonly known as the plantain lily, is a genus of about 70 species of rhizomatous, herbaceous, perennials.</p>
<p>These plants are native to eastern Asia, particularly China, Japan, and Korea, and are widely cultivated for their attractive, often variegated foliage. Hosta leaves are typically broad, heart-shaped, and can range in color from deep green to blue-green, with some varieties displaying white or yellow variegation. They produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or green, appearing on tall, slender stalks.</p>
<p>Hostas thrive in shady, moist environments and are popular in garden landscapes for their ornamental value.</p>
