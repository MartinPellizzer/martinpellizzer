                    <h1>Haumaniastrum coriaceum</h1>
<p>Haumaniastrum coriaceum, commonly known as the desert holly, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features thick, waxy leaves that are adapted to store water and reduce transpiration in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Overall, Haumaniastrum coriaceum exemplifies the botanical adaptations of desert flora to extreme conditions.</p>
