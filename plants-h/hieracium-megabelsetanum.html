<p>Hieracium megabelsetanum, commonly known as the giant hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust growth and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has a basal rosette of leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Its flowering stems can grow up to 1 meter tall, making it a striking presence in its natural habitat.</p>
