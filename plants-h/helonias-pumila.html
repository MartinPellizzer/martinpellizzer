<p>Helonias pumila, commonly known as the dwarf bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater wetlands and is often found in marshy areas. Its leaves are simple and ribbon-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged.</p>
<p>Helonias pumila plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to the food web and maintaining water quality.</p>
