                    <h1>Hapalochilus microrhombos</h1>
<p>Hapalochilus microrhombos, commonly known as the small rhombus liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a flattened thallus with a dense arrangement of rhomboid-shaped cells, giving it its common name. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a structure composed of specialized cells for absorption and photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Hapalochilus microrhombos is often used in ecological studies to assess air quality and habitat conditions due to its sensitivity to environmental changes.</p>
