                    <h1>Helicteres hirsuta var. viscida</h1>
<p>Helicteres hirsuta var. viscida, commonly known as the sticky helicteres, is a variant of the helicteres hirsuta species native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>This plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which often produce a sticky or viscid substance. The leaves are typically large, ovate, and have a rough texture, while the flowers are clustered in panicles and are usually yellow or greenish-yellow. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>The viscid secretion may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores or to trap small insects.</p>
