<p>Hesperevax, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers. The plant is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom at night, attracting moths for pollination. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Hesperevax produces small, round berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife.</p>
