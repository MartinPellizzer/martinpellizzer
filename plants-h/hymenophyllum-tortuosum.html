<p>Hymenophyllum tortuosum, commonly known as the twisted fern, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, moss-like fronds that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum tortuosum is notable for its intricate, often curling frond morphology, which contributes to its distinctive appearance.</p>
