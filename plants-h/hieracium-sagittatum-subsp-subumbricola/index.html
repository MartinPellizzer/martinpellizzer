<p>Common hawkweed, scientifically known as Hieracium sagittatum subsp. subumbricola, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the sunflower family, Asteraceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and hairy stems. This subspecies is often found in meadows, woodlands, and rocky areas where it thrives in partial shade. While it may resemble other hawkweed species, its unique leaf shape and growth pattern set it apart. Due to its hardy nature, it is both a valued ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions.</p>
