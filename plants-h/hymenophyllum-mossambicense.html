<p>Hymenophyllum mossambicense, commonly known as the African haircap moss, is a species of liverwort that belongs to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and its small, leaf-like structures called phyllidia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a distinct midrib, and the plant produces small, capsule-like sporangia for reproduction.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum mossambicense is often found in humid, forested areas and plays a role in soil stabilization and moisture retention.</p>
