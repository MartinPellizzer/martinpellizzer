<p>Hymenolepis platyrhynchos, commonly known as the broad-headed tapeworm, is a parasitic flatworm belonging to the family Hymenolepididae.</p>
<p>It is a small, segmented tapeworm that primarily infects rodents, particularly rats, as its definitive host. The adult worm resides in the small intestine of the host and attaches to the intestinal wall using a muscular suckers and a rostellum. Its life cycle involves an intermediate host, typically beetles, which are ingested by the definitive host.</p>
<p>The botany of this organism is not directly related to plant life, as it is an animal parasite, and its study falls under zoology rather than botany.</p>
