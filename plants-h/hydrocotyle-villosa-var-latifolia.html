<p>Hydrocotyle villosa var. latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf marsh pennywort, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in the Americas.</p>

The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic life.</p>
