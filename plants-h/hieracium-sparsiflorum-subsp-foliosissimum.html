<p>Hieracium sparsiflorum subsp.</p>
<p>foliosissimum, commonly known as the slender spearthistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its upright, sparsely branched stem and finely divided, serrated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish composite flowers arranged in a capitulum, which are typically borne on long, slender peduncles. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and locally endemic species.</p>
