                    <h1>Hippomarathrum libanotis var. pungens</h1>
<p>Hippomarathrum libanotis var. pungens, commonly known as the spiny desert hibiscus, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It features woody stems covered in sharp, spiny projections, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to store water in harsh desert conditions.</p>
<p>The species is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
