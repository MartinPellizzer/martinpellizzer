                    <h1>Herpetophytum appendicula</h1>
<p>Herpetophytum appendicula, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, and is often found on the trunks of trees in the canopy. The plant has striking white or pale green flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its common name. Its unique morphology includes fleshy leaves and a slender stem with a single, elongated flower spike.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and threats from deforestation, Herpetophytum appendicula is considered critically endangered.</p>
