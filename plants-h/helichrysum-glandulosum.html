                    <h1>Helichrysum glandulosum</h1>
<p>Helichrysum glandulosum, commonly known as the sticky helichrysum, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and clusters of small, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has glandular hairs on its leaves and stems, which give it a sticky texture and help it retain moisture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>The flowers are often used in traditional medicine and are also popular in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting color.</p>
