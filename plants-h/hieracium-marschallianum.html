<p>Hieracium marschallianum, commonly known as the marsh hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosette of leaves, which help it retain moisture in wet environments. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often found in marshes and wet meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it can outcompete native species in certain habitats.</p>
