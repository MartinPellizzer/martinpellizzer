<p>Humularia descampsii var. nyassica, commonly known as the Nyassian humularia, is a rare flowering plant native to parts of East Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a slight pubescence, while the flowers are usually white or pale pink.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
