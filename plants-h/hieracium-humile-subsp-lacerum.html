<p>Hieracium humile subsp.</p>
<p>lacerum, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats of bright yellow flowers, which bloom from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant has hairy, linear leaves that are often curled or folded, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Its subspecies classification reflects subtle differences in leaf structure and flower morphology compared to other hawkweed species.</p>
