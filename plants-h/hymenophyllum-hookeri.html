<p>Hymenophyllum hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's filmy fern, is a member of the Hymenophyllaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, delicate fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are narrow, elongated, and covered with a fine, silky layer of hair, giving it a distinctive appearance.
