                    <h1>Huernia lopanthera</h1>
<p>Huernia lopanthera, commonly known as the horned ice plant, is a succulent native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems covered in small, translucent tubercles that give it a unique, almost crystalline appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are often reduced to spines, a characteristic adaptation to its arid native environment.</p>
<p>Huernia lopanthera is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
