                            <h1>Hevea Guianensis Subsp. Marginata</h1>
<p>Marginate rubber tree, scientifically known as Hevea guianensis subsp. marginata, is a unique species native to the rainforests of South America. This tree is distinguished by its striking white veins that run along its broad, glossy leaves. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is closely related to the commercially important rubber tree, Hevea brasiliensis. Despite its botanical significance, it remains relatively understudied compared to its more well-known relative. The plant's ecological role and potential for latex production make it an intriguing subject for further research.</p>
