                    <h1>Hydrocotyle peltata</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle peltata, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically floating on the water surface or partially submerged. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle peltata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
