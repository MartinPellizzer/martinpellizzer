                    <h1>Haumaniastrum membranaceum</h1>
<p>Haumaniastrum membranaceum, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, exhibiting drought tolerance due to its succulent-like leaves. The plant produces showy, five-petaled yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that contains numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
