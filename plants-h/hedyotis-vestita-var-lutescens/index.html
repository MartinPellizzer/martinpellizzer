<p>Golden hedyotis, scientifically known as Hedyotis vestita var. lutescens, is a strikingly beautiful flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is prized for its vibrant yellow blooms that appear in clusters during the warmer months. This variant of Hedyotis vestita stands out due to its distinct golden hue, which sets it apart from other members of the genus. Often found in moist, shaded environments, it thrives in areas with high humidity and partial sunlight. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners and botanists alike.</p>
