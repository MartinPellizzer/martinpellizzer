                <h1>Heterolamium debile</h1>
<p>Heterolamium debile, commonly known as the slender mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and white, fleshy berries. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through haustoria that attach to its host. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, humid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can have a significant impact on the health of its host trees.</p>
