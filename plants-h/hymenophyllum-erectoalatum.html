                    <h1>Hymenophyllum erectoalatum</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum erectoalatum, commonly known as the erect-leaf filmy fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, thin, and translucent fronds that are often covered with a fine layer of moisture. The plant's sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Hymenophyllum genus. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and habitat make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
