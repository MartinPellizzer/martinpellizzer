                    <h1>Hieracium × glaucocephalum</h1>
<p>Hieracium × glaucocephalum, commonly known as the bluehead hawkweed, is a hybrid plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of blue-green leaves and tall, branched stems that bear yellow flowers. The plant produces small, composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits variability in morphology and is sometimes difficult to distinguish from its parent species.</p>
