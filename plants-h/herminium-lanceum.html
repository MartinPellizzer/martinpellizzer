                    <h1>Herminium lanceum</h1>
<p>Herminium lanceum, commonly known as the lance-leaved twayblade, is a perennial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and its lack of chlorophyll, making it a myco-heterotroph, relying on fungal associations for nutrition. The plant produces a single, erect spike of small, greenish-white flowers, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
