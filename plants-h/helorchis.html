                    <h1>Helorchis</h1>
<p>Helorchis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often pale or translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. Helorchis species typically thrive in humid, shaded environments with high air humidity and moderate temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a conservation concern.</p>
