                    <h1>Houstonia purpurea var. ciliolata</h1>
<p>Houstonia purpurea var. ciliolata, commonly known as the ciliate blue-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, though it is often mistaken for a flowering plant due to its showy blooms. The plant features slender, grass-like stems with small, clustered flowers that are typically blue to purple in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant thrives in moist, acidic soils in woodland habitats.</p>
<p>The variety ciliolata is distinguished by its finely hairy margins on the leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance.</p>
