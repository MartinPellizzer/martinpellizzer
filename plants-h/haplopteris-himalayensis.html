                    <h1>Haplopteris himalayensis</h1>
<p>Haplopteris himalayensis, commonly known as the Himalayan rock fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments on rocky soils. The plant has a slender, creeping rhizome with lanceolate, serrated fronds that are usually dark green in color. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Haplopteris himalayensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying fern diversity in high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
