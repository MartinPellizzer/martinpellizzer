                    <h1>Hydnophytum formicarum</h1>
<p>Hydnophytum formicarum, commonly known as the ant plant, is a tropical climbing plant that forms a unique symbiotic relationship with ants.</p>
<p>Its hollow, leaf-like structures provide shelter for colonies of ants, which in turn protect the plant from herbivores. The plant's leaves are modified into leaf-like pseudobulbs that house the ant colonies, and it relies on them for defense. It is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The ant plant is notable for its specialized morphology and mutualistic ecological interactions.</p>
