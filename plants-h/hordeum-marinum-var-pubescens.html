                    <h1>Hordeum marinum var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Hordeum marinum var. pubescens, commonly known as sea barley, is a coastal grass species native to temperate regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky coastal areas, where it tolerates salt spray and wind. Its inflorescence consists of compact, cylindrical spikelets, and it produces small, hard grains.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize dunes.</p>
