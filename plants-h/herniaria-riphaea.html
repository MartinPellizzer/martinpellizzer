                    <h1>Herniaria riphaea</h1>
<p>Herniaria riphaea, commonly known as the coastal sandwort, is a low-growing flowering plant that thrives in sandy coastal environments.</p>
<p>It produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its root system is adapted to stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Herniaria riphaea is often found in maritime climates, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds.</p>
