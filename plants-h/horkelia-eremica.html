                    <h1>Horkelia eremica</h1>
<p>Horkelia eremica, commonly known as the desert horkelia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with hairy stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has adapted to harsh desert conditions with deep roots and a compact growth form to conserve water. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Horkelia eremica plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
