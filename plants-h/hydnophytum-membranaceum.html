                    <h1>Hydnophytum membranaceum</h1>
<p>Hydnophytum membranaceum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of visible leaves and its ability to absorb nutrients through its roots rather than through photosynthesis. The plant produces small, pale green or white flowers that are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
