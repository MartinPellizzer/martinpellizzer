                    <h1>Hevea brasiliensis var. latifolia</h1>
<p>Hevea brasiliensis var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved rubber tree, is a variant of the rubber tree native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and is primarily cultivated for its latex, which is used in the production of natural rubber. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 20 meters in optimal conditions. Its flowering and fruiting habits are less studied compared to other Hevea species, but it plays a role in genetic diversity within the genus.</p>
<p>The variety is of interest to botanists and agricultural scientists due to its potential for sustainable rubber production.</p>
