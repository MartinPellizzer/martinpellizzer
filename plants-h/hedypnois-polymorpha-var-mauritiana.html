<p>Hedypnois polymorpha var. mauritiana, commonly known as the Mauritius starfish plant, is a unique succulent native to the island of Mauritius.</p>
<p>It features a compact, low-growing rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, blooming in late winter or early spring. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
