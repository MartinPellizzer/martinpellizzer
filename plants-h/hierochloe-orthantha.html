                    <h1>Hierochloe orthantha</h1>
<p>Hierochloe orthantha, commonly known as slender basket grass, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact, grass-like growth habit. The plant typically grows in open, rocky or sandy habitats, often in high-altitude or polar environments. It produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are adapted to cold climates and short growing seasons.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, Hierochloe orthantha is considered an indicator species for alpine and tundra ecosystems.</p>
