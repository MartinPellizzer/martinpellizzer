<p>Hatiora clavata, commonly known as the Christmas cactus, is a popular ornamental plant native to Brazil. It is prized for its vibrant flowers that bloom around the holiday season, making it a festive addition to homes and gardens. This species is characterized by its segmented stems and pointed leaves, which give it a unique and attractive appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.
