                    <h1>Humularia upembae</h1>
<p>Humularia upembae, commonly known as the Upemba fern, is a rare and unique plant species found in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble those of a fern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near water bodies such as lakes and rivers. Its reproductive structures are small and clustered, contributing to its limited distribution.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, Humularia upembae remains a poorly understood and endangered species.</p>
