                    <h1>Hydrocleys parviflora</h1>
<p>Hydrocleys parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered water lily, is a semi-aquatic plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, providing shade and habitat for aquatic life. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in shallow water and absorbing nutrients from the sediment.</p>
<p>Hydrocleys parviflora is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes.</p>
