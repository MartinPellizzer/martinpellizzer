                            <h1>Hieracium Sabaudum Subsp. Salticola</h1>
<p>Hieracium sabaudum subsp. salticola is a lesser-known member of the dandelion family known for its unique appearance and ecological significance. This subspecies is characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and rocky areas. Despite its modest size, it plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining biodiversity. Its resilience and adaptability make it a fascinating subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
