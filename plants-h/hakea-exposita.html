                    <h1>Hakea exposita</h1>
<p>Hakea exposita, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody, cylindrical stems and dense, needle-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in cylindrical spikes. Its seeds are enclosed in woody follicles that open to release the seeds when dry.</p>
<p>Hakea exposita is often found in coastal heathlands and is well-suited to sandy soils.</p>
