                    <h1>Haworthia limbata</h1>
<p>Haworthia limbata, commonly known as the Zulu window plant, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically green with white or pale markings. The leaves are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months.</p>
<p>This plant is well-suited for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal.</p>
