<p>Hedysarum humile var. fontanesii, commonly known as the dwarf sweet clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, often hairy stems that branch near the base, supporting small, trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces delicate, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to poor, rocky soils, allowing it to thrive in harsh alpine environments.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
