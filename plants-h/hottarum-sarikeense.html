<p>Hottarum sarikeense, commonly known as the Sarikeense Broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and derives its nutrients from host plants through specialized root structures called haustoria. This species is typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing on the roots of grasses and shrubs. Its flowers are small, tubular, and usually pale yellow or greenish in color.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecosystem dynamics by influencing host plant growth and diversity.</p>
