<p>Hieracium praecox subsp.</p>
<p>pseudobounophilum, commonly known as the early hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming basal leaves and yellow flowering heads.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring well-drained conditions. It produces small, composite flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from other Hieracium species, particularly in leaf shape and flower structure.</p>
