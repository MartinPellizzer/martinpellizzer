                    <h1>Hyobanche robusta</h1>
<p>Hyobanche robusta, commonly known as the giant milkvetch, is a parasitic plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and lacks chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host plants for nutrients. The plant produces striking, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are highly specialized, forming haustoria that penetrate the roots of host plants like various species of Astragalus.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and specific habitat requirements, it is considered rare and sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
