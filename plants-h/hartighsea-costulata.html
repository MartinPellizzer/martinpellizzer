<p>Hartighsea costulata, commonly known as the coastal frond fern, is a species of flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are often covered in fine, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in well-drained, saline conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Hartighsea costulata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small invertebrates.</p>
