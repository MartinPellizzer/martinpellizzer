                    <h1>Hydrocleys oblongifolia</h1>
<p>Hydrocleys oblongifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features broad, ovate leaves that are typically floating or partially submerged, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a delicate floral display to its habitat. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in shallow water.</p>
<p>Hydrocleys oblongifolia plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
