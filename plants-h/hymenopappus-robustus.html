<p>Hymenopappus robustus, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments.</p>
<p>Hymenopappus robustus is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils, making it a resilient species in harsh desert conditions.</p>
