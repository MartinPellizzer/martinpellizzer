<p>Haworthia planifolia var. transiens, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rosette-shaped body with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with distinct white or pale yellow markings. The leaves are often adorned with longitudinal stripes, giving the plant its characteristic zebra-like appearance. It produces small, tubular flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months.</p>
<p>This species is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light.</p>
