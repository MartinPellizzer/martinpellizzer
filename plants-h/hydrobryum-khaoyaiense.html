                    <h1>Hydrobryum khaoyaiense</h1>
<p>Hydrobryum khaoyaiense, commonly known as the Khaoyai water moss, is a rare aquatic plant native to Thailand.</p>
<p>It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes, where it forms dense, carpet-like mats on the substrate. The plant has slender, thread-like leaves that are typically green to reddish in color, depending on light exposure. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and it relies on water for reproduction and nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and pollution, it is considered vulnerable and is of interest for conservation efforts.</p>
