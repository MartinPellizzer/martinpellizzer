<p>Halimium lasianthum, commonly known as the purple sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cistaceae and is characterized by its compact structure and dense clusters of small, showy flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of pink to purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often arid habitat.</p>
<p>Halimium lasianthum is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy species found in alpine and subalpine environments.</p>
