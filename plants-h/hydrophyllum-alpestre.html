                    <h1>Hydrophyllum alpestre</h1>
<p>Hydrophyllum alpestre, commonly known as alpine hyssop, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil in rugged terrain, and it is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons.</p>
<p>Hydrophyllum alpestre plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine.</p>
