                    <h1>Hertia</h1>
<p>Hertia, commonly known as the "kangaroo paw," is a genus of flowering plants native to Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their unique, spurred flowers that resemble the foot of a kangaroo, hence their common name. Hertia species typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and are often found in coastal or sandy soils. They are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained conditions.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Hertia filiformis and Hertia glabra, which are valued for their resilience and aesthetic appeal.</p>
