                    <h1>Hydrocotyle trichophylla</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle trichophylla, commonly known as the silky water shield, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are often floating or partially submerged, with a soft, velvety texture due to the fine hairs on its surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically borne on short stalks above the water. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle trichophylla plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
