                    <h1>Hugonia orientalis</h1>
<p>Hugonia orientalis, commonly known as the oriental honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features opposite, elliptic leaves that are often slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers in clusters, typically in shades of yellow or orange, which bloom in late spring. Its berries are small, dark red, and edible, though not as commonly consumed as those of other honeysuckle species.</p>
<p>Hugonia orientalis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade.</p>
