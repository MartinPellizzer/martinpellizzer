                    <h1>Hieracium ciliatum var. repandum</h1>
<p>Hieracium ciliatum var. repandum, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as meadows, roadsides, and wetlands. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, ciliate leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its scientific name.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings.</p>
