                    <h1>Hypericum sessiliflorum</h1>
<p>Hypericum sessiliflorum, commonly known as the sessile-flower St. John's wort, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features upright, branched stems covered in yellow-orange flowers that bloom from June to August. The plant has opposite, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. Its medicinal properties are attributed to the presence of hypericin and pseudohypericin, which are responsible for its traditional use in treating mild depression.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in meadows and woodland edges.</p>
