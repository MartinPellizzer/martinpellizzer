                    <h1>Holcus fauriei</h1>
<p>Holcus fauriei, commonly known as the Faurie's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually slightly hairy, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Holcus fauriei is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in challenging soil conditions.</p>
