<p>Hemionitis woodfordii, commonly known as the Woodford's hemionitis, is a rare and delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of central China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hemionitidaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like fronds that are often covered in a fine, whitish coating. The plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, typically found in rocky or forested areas. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing capsules, are small and clustered at the base of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Hemionitis woodfordii is considered an endangered species.</p>
