                    <h1>Hemizygia rehmannii</h1>
<p>Hemizygia rehmannii, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the southern United States, particularly Florida and Texas.</p>
<p>It is a small, shrub-like plant with woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemizygia rehmannii is highly sensitive to environmental changes and habitat destruction.</p>
