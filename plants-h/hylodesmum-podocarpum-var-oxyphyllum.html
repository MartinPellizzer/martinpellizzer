<p>Hylodesmum podocarpum var. oxyphyllum, commonly known as the white-flowered rockrose, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a powdery white coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ability to store water make it an interesting subject for botanical study and cultivation.</p>
