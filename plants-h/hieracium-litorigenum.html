<p>Hieracium litorigenum, commonly known as sea hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shores and dunes, adapting to salty and windy conditions. The plant features yellow daisy-like flowers with a central disc and ray florets, blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are usually basal, with a rough, hairy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Hieracium litorigenum is often found in disturbed coastal habitats and is considered a characteristic species of maritime ecosystems.</p>
