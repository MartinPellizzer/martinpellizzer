                    <h1>Hydrocotyle rotundifolia</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle rotundifolia, commonly known as marsh pennywort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features rounded, succulent leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in diameter, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the summer months, often in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, stream banks, and other aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it an effective pioneer species in disturbed wetland areas.</p>
