<p>Hedera coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved ivy, is a species of climbing plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a fine, granular texture, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Hedera coriacea is often found growing on walls, trees, and rocky surfaces, where it can climb and spread rapidly.</p>
