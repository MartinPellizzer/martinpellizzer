<p>Hymenophyllum eboracense, commonly known as the Yorkshire moss, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, moss-like appearance and is typically found growing on shaded, moist rock surfaces or tree trunks in temperate regions. The fronds are narrow, strap-shaped, and often have a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. It produces spores in small, clustered structures called sporangia, which are typically found on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value.</p>
