<p>Helianthemum × coronadoi nothosubsp.</p>
<p>coronadoi, commonly known as the Coronado stonecrop, is a hybrid succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the family Cactus Family (Cactaceae) and is characterized by its compact, mound-like growth habit.</p>
<p>The plant features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. It produces showy yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes.</p>
