                    <h1>Hiya nigrescens</h1>
<p>Hiya nigrescens, commonly known as the black-hued fern, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that often appear almost black in shade. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly across forest floors. Its spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Hiya nigrescens thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense undergrowth where it competes for limited light.</p>
