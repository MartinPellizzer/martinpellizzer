                    <h1>Heliamphora heterodoxa f. glabella</h1>
<p>Heliamphora heterodoxa f. glabella, commonly known as the glabrous heliamphora, is a carnivorous plant native to the tepuis of Venezuela.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pitcher-shaped leaves, which secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant's leaves are typically shorter and more robust compared to other heliamphora species, with a reduced hair cover, giving it its "glabella" designation. It thrives in high-altitude, nutrient-poor environments, relying on insect prey for essential nutrients.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and specialized adaptations make it an intriguing subject for botanical study.</p>
