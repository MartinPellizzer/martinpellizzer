<p>Habenella seticauda, commonly known as the hairy-tailed bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are slender and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>Habenella seticauda is a carnivorous plant that supplements its nutrient intake by digesting trapped prey.</p>
