<p>Hubertia myrtifolia, commonly known as the rock fig or rock pear, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, upright stems that branch out into a compact, shrub-like form. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by edible, pear-shaped fruits. Its leaves are thick, waxy, and often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Hubertia myrtifolia is well adapted to arid environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops.</p>
