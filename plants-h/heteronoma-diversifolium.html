                    <h1>Heteronoma diversifolium</h1>
<p>Heteronoma diversifolium, commonly known as the diverse-leaf heteronoma, is a rare and specialized plant species found in specific alpine environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique foliage, which varies in shape and size across different parts of the plant, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, where it faces harsh climatic conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a range of colors that aid in pollination by insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Heteronoma diversifolium is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
