                    <h1>Habenaria cordifolia</h1>
<p>Habenaria cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features a sympodial growth habit with a rhizome and pseudobulbs that support its leaf structure. The plant produces showy, often fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are usually elliptical or ovate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.</p>
