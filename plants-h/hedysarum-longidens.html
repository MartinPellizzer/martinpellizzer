<p>Hedysarum longidens, commonly known as the long-stemmed vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Hedysarum longidens is adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a resilient plant in arid environments.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules makes it ecologically significant in soil enrichment.</p>
