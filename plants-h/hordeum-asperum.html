                    <h1>Hordeum asperum</h1>
<p>Hordeum asperum, commonly known as rough barley, is a wild grass species native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect growth habit and spikelet-bearing inflorescences, with bracts that are often rough or hairy. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its seeds are enclosed in a tough, inedible hull. Hordeum asperum is typically found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields.</p>
<p>It has been studied for its potential in phytoremediation due to its ability to accumulate heavy metals.</p>
