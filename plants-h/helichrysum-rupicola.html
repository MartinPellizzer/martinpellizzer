<p>Helichrysum rupicola, commonly known as the rock everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are often mistaken for leaves, which contribute to its ornamental value. It is drought-tolerant and prefers full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The plant's name reflects its longevity and the way its flowers dry into lasting, golden-yellow structures.</p>
