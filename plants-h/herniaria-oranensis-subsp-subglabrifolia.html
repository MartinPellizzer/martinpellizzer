<p>Herniaria oranensis subsp.</p>
<p>subglabrifolia, commonly known as the smooth-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, though the subspecies subglabrifolia has a smoother texture.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
