                    <h1>Herniaria hirsuta f. pauciflora</h1>
<p>Herniaria hirsuta f. pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered bladderworts, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves and reduced floral structures, typical of the genus Herniaria.
