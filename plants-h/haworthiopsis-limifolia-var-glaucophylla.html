<p>Haworthiopsis limifolia var. glaucophylla, commonly known as the Blue-leaf Haworthia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features compact rosettes of narrow, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, giving it its common name. The leaves are covered in a powdery waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers on short, upright stems during the cooler months.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and container planting due to its low maintenance requirements.</p>
