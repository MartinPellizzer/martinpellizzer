                    <h1>Hydrocotyle simulans</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle simulans, commonly known as the marsh mallow or water shield, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of heart-shaped, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in shallow water or moist soil.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle simulans plays an important ecological role by stabilizing shoreline soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
