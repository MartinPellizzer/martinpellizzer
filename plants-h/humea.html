                    <h1>Humea</h1>
<p>Humea, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the family Melanthiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its ethereal common name. Native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America, Humea thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late spring, often preceding the emergence of its foliage.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Humea is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
