<p>Hedysarum ammoxylon, commonly known as the sand-hedgerow vetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, trifoliate leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh, dry conditions. The plant produces yellowish to pale pink flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees. Its seeds are encased in small, hairy pods that mature in late summer.</p>
<p>Hedysarum ammoxylon plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
