The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. It has a rhizomatous root system and is often found in association with specific fungal mycorrhizae.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
