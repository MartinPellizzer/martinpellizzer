                    <h1>Hiraea amazonica</h1>
<p>Hiraea amazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian star moss, is a rare and unique plant native to the dense rainforests of the Amazon Basin.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its intricate, star-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures. The plant thrives in high humidity and shaded environments, often growing on the forest floor or as an epiphyte on tree trunks. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically green or white, and it produces tiny, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, Hiraea amazonica is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
