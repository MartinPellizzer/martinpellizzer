<p>Hymenophyllum consanguineum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, moss-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum consanguineum is known for its ability to retain moisture and is often found in high humidity areas such as rainforests.</p>
