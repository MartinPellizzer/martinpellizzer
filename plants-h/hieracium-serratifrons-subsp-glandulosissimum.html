<p>Hieracium serratifrons subsp.</p>
<p>glandulosissimum, commonly known as the glandular-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its serrated, lance-shaped leaves that are densely covered with glandular hairs, giving them a sticky texture.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in forest clearings.</p>
<p>Its subspecific name, *glandulosissimum*, refers to its notably glandular foliage, which is a key identifying feature.</p>
