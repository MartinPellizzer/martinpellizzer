<p>Heterosperma pinnatum var. ovatifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf water clover, is a variant of the water clover species native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ovate, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, providing a dense, carpet-like growth. The plant has small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in early spring, followed by the production of distinctive, three-lobed fruits. It thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important indicator species for assessing water quality and ecosystem health.</p>
