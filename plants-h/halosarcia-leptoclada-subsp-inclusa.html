<p>Halosarcia leptoclada subsp.</p>
<p>inclusa, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a herbaceous annual that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in the morning. Its leaves are ovate and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found along the coastline, where it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
