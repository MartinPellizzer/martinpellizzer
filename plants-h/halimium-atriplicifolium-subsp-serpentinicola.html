<p>Halimium atriplicifolium subsp.</p>
<p>serpentinicola, commonly known as the serpentine rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its small, glandular leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early spring.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, calcareous soils, particularly on serpentine rock formations. Its morphology reflects its specialized habitat, with compact growth and reduced leaf size.</p>
<p>The plant plays a role in stabilizing rocky soils and supports specific insect pollinators.</p>
