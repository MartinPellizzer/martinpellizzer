                    <h1>Heteropterys affinis</h1>
<p>Heteropterys affinis, commonly known as the red mangrove or *Rhizophora mangle*, is a tropical tree native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its extensive root system, which includes prop roots that help stabilize the tree in waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release buoyant seeds, aiding in dispersal by water.</p>
<p>Heteropterys affinis plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and stabilizing shorelines.</p>
