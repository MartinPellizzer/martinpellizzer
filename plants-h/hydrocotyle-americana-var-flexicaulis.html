<p>Hydrocotyle americana var. flexicaulis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water pennywort, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, marshes, and along stream edges. The plant features small, rounded leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a dense network of veins. Its stems are slender and often branched, allowing it to spread across the water's surface.</p>
<p>It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and stabilizing sediments.</p>
