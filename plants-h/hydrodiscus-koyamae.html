                    <h1>Hydrodiscus koyamae</h1>
<p>Hydrodiscus koyamae, commonly known as the Japanese water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features broad, floating leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface, allowing it to remain buoyant on water. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a subtle fragrance. Its roots are rhizomatous, enabling it to spread across still or slow-moving water bodies.</p>
<p>Hydrodiscus koyamae plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
