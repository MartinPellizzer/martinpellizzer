<p>Hyrtanandra ternata, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, dark brown bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by dark blue, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and limited natural range, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
