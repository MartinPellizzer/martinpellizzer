<p>Haworthia cymbiformis var. brevifolia, commonly known as the dwarf rosette Haworthia, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a dense rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically green with white or translucent markings. The leaves are short and broad, forming a tight cluster that gives the plant a compact appearance. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its hardiness and minimal care requirements.</p>
