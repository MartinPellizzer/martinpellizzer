<p>Hieracium subramosum subsp.</p>
<p>incurrens, commonly known as the upright hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in open grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring well-drained conditions.</p>
<p>The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are usually lance-shaped and hairy, with a central flowering stem that bears yellow disk flowers surrounded by ray florets. Its inflorescence is a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family, and it produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its upright growth habit and slightly shorter, more compact inflorescence compared to other members of the species.</p>
