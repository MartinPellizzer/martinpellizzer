                    <h1>Hymenophyllum contextum</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum contextum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, moss-like fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum contextum is notable for its unique morphology and ecological adaptations to its native habitat.</p>
