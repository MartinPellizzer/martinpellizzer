<p>Hieracium tridymocephalum, commonly known as the three-headed hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a flowering head composed of three distinct capitula, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its yellow flowers are surrounded by pale green ray florets, and it produces small, oval-shaped achenes as its seeds.</p>
<p>Hieracium tridymocephalum is often considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth.</p>
