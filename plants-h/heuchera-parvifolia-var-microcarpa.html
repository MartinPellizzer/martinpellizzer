                    <h1>Heuchera parvifolia var. microcarpa</h1>
<p>Heuchera parvifolia var. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf leaf heuchera, is a compact, low-growing perennial shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features dense, rounded clumps of foliage with dark green, velvety leaves that are smaller than those of the typical Heuchera parvifolia. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers on slender stalks in the spring, adding subtle floral interest. It prefers partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it ideal for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its compact size and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for ground cover and rock gardens.</p>
