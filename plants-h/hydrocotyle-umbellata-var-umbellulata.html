                    <h1>Hydrocotyle umbellata var. umbellulata</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle umbellata var. umbellulata, commonly known as the broadleaf water shield, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and slow-moving freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>It features floating leaves that are heart-shaped with a waxy surface, allowing it to remain buoyant. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, giving it its scientific name. Its roots help stabilize the substrate, while its leaves provide habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
<p>It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits.</p>
