<p>Hymenophyllum babindae, commonly known as the Babinda fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its spores are released from small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
