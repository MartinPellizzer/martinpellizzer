                    <h1>Helictotrichon pubescens var. alpinum</h1>
<p>Helictotrichon pubescens var. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and bluish-green foliage, which helps it withstand cold and harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra environments.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife.</p>
