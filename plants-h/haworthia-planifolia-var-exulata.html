<p>Haworthia planifolia var. exulata, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa.</p>

The plant typically produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
