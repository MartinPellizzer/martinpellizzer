                    <h1>Hordeum hirtiusculum</h1>
<p>Hordeum hirtiusculum, commonly known as the hairy barley, is a species of grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats. Its leaves are hairy, giving it its common name, and it produces tiny grains that are adapted for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>While not cultivated for grain production, it plays a role in ecological systems by providing food for wildlife and stabilizing soil.</p>
