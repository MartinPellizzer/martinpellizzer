<p>Hiernia angolensis, commonly known as the Angola thornveld grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear short, stiff hairs. The plant typically grows in open, dry habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Hiernia angolensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in its native range.</p>
