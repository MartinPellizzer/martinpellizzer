                    <h1>Hoffmannia stephaniae</h1>
<p>Hoffmannia stephaniae, commonly known as the mountain hoffmannia, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its delicate, clustered flowers and lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its blooming period occurs in late spring, producing small, white or pale pink flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hoffmannia stephaniae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
