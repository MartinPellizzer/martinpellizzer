                    <h1>Haplophyllum molle</h1>
<p>Haplophyllum molle, commonly known as the soft-leaved sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Montiaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Haplophyllum molle typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats.</p>
<p>Its low-growing habit and drought tolerance make it well adapted to harsh, sun-exposed conditions.</p>
