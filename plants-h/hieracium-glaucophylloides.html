<p>Hieracium glaucophylloides, commonly known as the glaucous hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features basal rosettes of hairy, glaucous (bluish-gray) leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically yellow and bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Hieracium glaucophylloides is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it can spread aggressively through its rhizomes.</p>
