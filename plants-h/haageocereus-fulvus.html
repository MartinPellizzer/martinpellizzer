<p>Haageocereus fulvus, commonly known as the golden night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, green stems and sparse, spiny foliage. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique blooming habit and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in desert gardens.</p>
