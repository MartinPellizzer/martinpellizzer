<p>Halimium halimifolium subsp.</p>
<p>lepidotum, commonly known as the silver carpet bugloss, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features silvery-gray foliage covered in fine, overlapping scales that reflect sunlight and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in late spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued in xeriscaping for its ornamental appearance and ecological benefits.</p>
