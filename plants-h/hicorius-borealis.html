                    <h1>Hicorius borealis</h1>
<p>Hicorius borealis, commonly known as the northern horned orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Arctic tundra.</p>
<p>It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its environment. The plant produces small, pale yellow or greenish flowers with a unique horn-like structure on its petals. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, helping to reduce water loss in the freezing climate.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species with limited distribution.</p>
