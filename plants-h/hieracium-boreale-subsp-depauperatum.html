<p>Hieracium boreale subsp.</p>
<p>depauperatum, commonly known as the northern hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters.</p>
<p>The plant is characterized by its reduced floral structure and is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. It is considered a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and has a fibrous root system.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is sometimes regarded as a rare or threatened species in certain regions.</p>
