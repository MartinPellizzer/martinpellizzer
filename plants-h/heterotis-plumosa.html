                    <h1>Heterotis plumosa</h1>
<p>Heterotis plumosa, commonly known as the silky water lily, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom above the water surface, typically during the warm season. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate, allowing it to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>Heterotis plumosa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
