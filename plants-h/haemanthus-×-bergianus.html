<p>Haemanthus × bergianus, commonly known as the Natal lily, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Haemanthus albiflos and Haemanthus citrinus.</p>
<p>It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its striking, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30–60 cm and features strap-like, grassy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to produce multiple flower stalks, adding visual interest to the garden.</p>
