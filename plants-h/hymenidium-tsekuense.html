                    <h1>Hymenidium tsekuense</h1>
<p>Hymenidium tsekuense, commonly known as the Tseku cycad, is a rare cycad species native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and its role in the ecological diversity of the region.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
