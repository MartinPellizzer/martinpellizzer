                    <h1>Hexuris</h1>
<p>Hexuris, commonly known as false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and small, dandelion-like yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Hexuris species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. They have hairy stems and leaves that are often glandular, which can help in identifying the genus.</p>
<p>The fruits are small, dry achenes with pappus, aiding in wind dispersal.</p>
