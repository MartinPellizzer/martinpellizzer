<p>Hamosa amplexa, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a tropical plant native to regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread along the ground or climb over other vegetation. The plant features pinnately compound leaves with a distinctive clasping base that wraps around its support structure. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves, typical of the fern family.</p>
<p>Hamosa amplexa thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests.</p>
