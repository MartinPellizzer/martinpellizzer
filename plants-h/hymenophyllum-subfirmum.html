<p>Hymenophyllum subfirmum, commonly known as the firm moss or narrow-leaved hymenophyllum, is a fern that belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant has a unique structure with a central midrib and a dense, overlapping arrangement of leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a specialized indusium.</p>
