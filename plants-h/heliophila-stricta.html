<p>Heliophila stricta, commonly known as narrowleaf waterplantain, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in ponds, ditches, and marshes. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette at the base, with small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil, contributing to wetland ecosystems.</p>
<p>Heliophila stricta is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions.</p>
