<p>Habenaria brevidens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Korean Peninsula.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant features slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves, with small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are often rhizomatous, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>
