                    <h1>Herpestis stricta var. elongata</h1>
<p>Herpestis stricta var. elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to certain regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It possesses slender, upright stems that are often covered in small, bladder-like structures used to trap aquatic invertebrates. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies, where it relies on its specialized adaptations to obtain nutrients. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters near the water's surface.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to other species in the genus Herpestis, sharing similar morphological and ecological traits.</p>
