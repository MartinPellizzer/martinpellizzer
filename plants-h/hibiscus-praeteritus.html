                    <h1>Hibiscus praeteritus</h1>
<p>Hibiscus praeteritus, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often with a striking contrast between the petals and the vibrant yellow stamens. The plant has rough, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Hibiscus praeteritus is well adapted to xeric conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
