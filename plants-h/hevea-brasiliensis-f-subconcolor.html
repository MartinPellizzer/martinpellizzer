                    <h1>Hevea brasiliensis f. subconcolor</h1>
<p>Hevea brasiliensis f. subconcolor, commonly known as the subconcolor rubber tree, is a variant of the rubber tree native to the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth margin. The plant produces latex, which is harvested for rubber production, though this variety is less commonly used commercially compared to the standard Hevea brasiliensis. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil.</p>
<p>The subconcolor form is noted for its ecological significance in maintaining biodiversity within its native habitat.</p>
