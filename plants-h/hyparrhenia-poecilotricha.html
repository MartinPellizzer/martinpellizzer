                    <h1>Hyparrhenia poecilotricha</h1>
<p>Hyparrhenia poecilotricha, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spikerush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny flowers. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
