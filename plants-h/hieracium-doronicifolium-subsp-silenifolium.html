<p>Hieracium doronicifolium subsp.</p>
<p>silenifolium, commonly known as the silversword or silverleaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver- or gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces a tall, flowering stem that bears yellow composite flowers, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are lanceolate to ovate in shape and have a distinctive silvery sheen due to dense pubescence.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to harsh, alpine environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>
