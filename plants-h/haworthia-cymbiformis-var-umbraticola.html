                    <h1>Haworthia cymbiformis var. umbraticola</h1>
<p>Haworthia cymbiformis var. umbraticola, commonly known as the shadow Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of thick, fleshy leaves with a distinctive waxy coating that helps it retain moisture. The leaves are typically green with prominent white or pale markings, especially along the edges. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
