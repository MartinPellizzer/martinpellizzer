                    <h1>Humea gracillima</h1>
<p>Humea gracillima, commonly known as the slender Humea, is a rare and delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae, which includes many epiphytic and lithophytic species. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of microscopic scales. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Humea gracillima is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
