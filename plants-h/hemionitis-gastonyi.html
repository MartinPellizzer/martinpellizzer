<p>Hemionitis gastonyi, commonly known as the African rock fern, is a unique fern species native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, delicate fronds that are often covered in a layer of fine, silky hairs. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Hemionitis gastonyi plays a minor but ecologically significant role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats.</p>
