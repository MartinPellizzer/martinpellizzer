                    <h1>Hieracium caesium var. maculiferum</h1>
<p>Hieracium caesium var. maculiferum, commonly known as the spotted hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically hairy and have a distinctive spotted or mottled appearance, which gives the plant its common name. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>This plant is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes.</p>
