                    <h1>Hakea aenigma</h1>
<p>Hakea aenigma, commonly known as the ghost hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, often spiky, foliage and its striking, bottle-shaped floral spikes. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Hakea aenigma is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
