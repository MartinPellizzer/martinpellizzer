<p>Hieracium murorum subsp.</p>
<p>svinicense, commonly known as the mouse-ear hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It has heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers with a central disk.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators in its native habitats.</p>
