<p>Habenaria lavrensis, commonly known as the Lavrensis orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions like Borneo and Sumatra.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that often display a mix of white, green, and yellow hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and strap-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>The orchid's flowers bloom in clusters, making it a visually striking addition to botanical gardens and a subject of interest for researchers studying orchid diversity.</p>
