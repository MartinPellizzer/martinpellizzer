                    <h1>Hydranthelium egense</h1>
<p>Hydranthelium egense, commonly known as the golden star moss, is a rare and delicate epiphytic liverwort found in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It has a low-growing, cushion-like structure with dense, overlapping leaves that form a compact rosette. The plant produces small, yellowish-green gemmae, which are specialized structures for vegetative reproduction. Its leaves are typically smooth and have a waxy surface, helping to retain moisture in its moist, forest-floor habitat.</p>
<p>Hydranthelium egense is often found growing on decaying wood or rock surfaces in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
