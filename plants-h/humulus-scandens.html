                    <h1>Humulus scandens</h1>
<p>Humulus scandens, commonly known as the creeping hemp vine, is a climbing plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vigorous growth habit and ability to twine around supports, often reaching lengths of several meters. The plant features heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves that are typically pubescent, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, clustered in loose, hanging catkins, and it produces both male and female inflorescences.</p>
<p>Humulus scandens is related to the cannabis genus and contains compounds similar to those found in marijuana, though it is primarily valued for its ornamental and historical uses.</p>
