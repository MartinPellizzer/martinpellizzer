<p>Herniaria teknensis, commonly known as the Teknische Herniaria, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered foliage and pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species.</p>
