                    <h1>Helospora flavescens</h1>
<p>Helospora flavescens, commonly known as the yellow stinkhorn, is a unique fungal plant that produces a foul-smelling, yellowish cap.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, organic-rich environments, often found in decaying wood or leaf litter. The spore-bearing structure, called a gleba, is enclosed within a fleshy, sac-like volva. The fungus plays a role in decomposing organic matter, contributing to nutrient cycling in ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its distinctive odor attracts flies, which aid in spore dispersal.</p>
