<p>Hypolepis lactea, commonly known as the milky sword fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, pinnate fronds that are often covered in a whitish, milky sap, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent in some species, though this trait is less common in Hypolepis lactea.</p>
