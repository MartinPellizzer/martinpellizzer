<p>Halimium arenicola, commonly known as the sand hawthorn, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in coastal and inland dunes. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Halimium arenicola is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize sandy soils.</p>
