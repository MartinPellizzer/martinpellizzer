                    <h1>Hydrostachys laciniata</h1>
<p>Hydrostachys laciniata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf waterwheel, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Africa.</p>
<p>It features finely dissected, grass-like leaves that float on the water's surface, with roots submerged in the substrate. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling a wheel, hence its common name. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands.</p>
<p>Hydrostachys laciniata plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
