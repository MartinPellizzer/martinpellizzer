                    <h1>Hetaeria biloba</h1>
<p>Hetaeria biloba, commonly known as the twin-lobed fern, is a rare and delicate species belonging to the family Hetaeriaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, bipinnate fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Hetaeria biloba is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
