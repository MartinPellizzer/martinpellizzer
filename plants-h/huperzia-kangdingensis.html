                    <h1>Huperzia kangdingensis</h1>
<p>Huperzia kangdingensis, commonly known as the Kangding clubmoss, is a rare and ancient fern-like plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, scale-like leaves that form a rosette structure. Native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China, this species thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction and limited natural propagation, Huperzia kangdingensis is considered endangered and requires protection.</p>
