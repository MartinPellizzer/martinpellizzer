                    <h1>Hieracium sparsifolium var. oligodon</h1>
<p>Hieracium sparsifolium var. oligodon, commonly known as the sparse-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and ray florets. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and arranged alternately along the stem, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer, contributing to its role in supporting pollinators.</p>
