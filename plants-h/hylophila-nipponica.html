<p>Hylophila nipponica, commonly known as the Japanese water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that float on the surface of freshwater habitats. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving water, often found in ponds, lakes, and rice paddies. Its rhizomes form dense mats, which can help stabilize water bodies and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Hylophila nipponica is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
