<p>Hymenophyllum foxworthyi, commonly known as the Foxworthys' filmy fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found on rock surfaces or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in small, clustered structures called sori.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an important component of epiphytic and lithophytic ecosystems.</p>
