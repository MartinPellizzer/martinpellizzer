                    <h1>Hydrocotyle modesta var. repens</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle modesta var. repens, commonly known as the creeping marsh mallow, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetlands and moist soils in North America.</p>
<p>It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. The plant spreads via rhizomes, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>It is often found in marshy areas, stream banks, and other waterlogged habitats, where it plays a role in wetland ecology.</p>
