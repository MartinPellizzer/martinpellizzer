                    <h1>Hemiachyris</h1>
<p>Hemiachyris, commonly known as seaside daisies, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to coastal regions of the Americas and are well adapted to sandy, saline soils. Hemiachyris species typically have small, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white or pink petals. They are often found in dunes and other coastal habitats where they help stabilize the soil.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Hemiachyris scoparia and Hemiachyris ambigua, which are valued for their hardiness and ornamental appeal.</p>
