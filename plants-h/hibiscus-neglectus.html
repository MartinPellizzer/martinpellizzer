<p>Hibiscus neglectus, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces capsules that contain numerous seeds. Hibiscus neglectus is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots and a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It is often found in rocky soils and is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
