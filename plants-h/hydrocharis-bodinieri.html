                    <h1>Hydrocharis bodinieri</h1>
<p>Hydrocharis bodinieri, commonly known as the floating heart, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Araceae family and is characterized by its floating, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, emerging from the leaf axils. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes, where it can spread rapidly through vegetative reproduction.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, it can become invasive in non-native habitats.</p>
