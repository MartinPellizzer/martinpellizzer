<p>Hemionitis deltoidea, commonly known as the delta fern, is a unique aquatic plant native to the wetlands of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, deltoid-shaped fronds that are typically divided into three lobes. The plant thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Hemionitis deltoidea plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to water filtration.</p>
