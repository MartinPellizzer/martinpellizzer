<p>Haageocereus australis var. acinacispinus, commonly known as the Acacia-spined Cereus, is a cactus native to South America, particularly Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of white flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a columnar growth habit with ribbed stems that store water, adapting to arid environments. Its spines are modified leaves, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss.</p>
<p>It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
