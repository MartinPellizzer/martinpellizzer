<p>Hymenophyllum fuciforme, commonly known as the black moss, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, dark green, almost black leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum fuciforme plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing microhabitats for small organisms.</p>
