                    <h1>Herniaria degenii</h1>
<p>Herniaria degenii, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy leaves and produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are often covered in a thick layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Herniaria degenii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
