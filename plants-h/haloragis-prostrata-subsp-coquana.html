<p>Haloragis prostrata subsp.</p>
<p>coquana, commonly known as the coastal wallaby grass, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial herb native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid or salty environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, often in shades of green or pink, which are pollinated by wind or insects. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal dunes and cliffs, where it plays a role in stabilizing the substrate.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to harsh coastal conditions makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems.</p>
