<p>Hippophae neurocarpa subsp.</p>
<p>neurocarpa, commonly known as the sandthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, yellow-orange berries that are rich in vitamin C and essential fatty acids.</p>
<p>The plant has alternate, ovate leaves with a rough texture and is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions. It produces showy yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by the development of its distinctive fruits.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sandy soils.</p>
