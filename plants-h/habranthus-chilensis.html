                    <h1>Habranthus chilensis</h1>
<p>Habranthus chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean starflower, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available.</p>
