                    <h1>Hedysarum inundatum</h1>
<p>Hedysarum inundatum, commonly known as the water vetch, is a perennial legume native to wetlands and moist soils in North America.</p>
<p>It produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with trifoliate or pinnate structures, and its stems are often prostrate or ascending. It plays an important role in soil stabilization and nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>Hedysarum inundatum is often found in riparian zones and is adapted to fluctuating water levels.</p>
