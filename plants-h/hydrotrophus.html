                    <h1>Hydrotrophus</h1>
<p>Hydrotrophus, commonly known as the water-seeking plant, is a unique species that exhibits hydrotropic growth, meaning it grows in response to moisture.</p>
<p>This plant typically thrives in moist or wet environments such as marshes or along stream banks. Its roots are adapted to absorb water efficiently, allowing it to flourish in areas with high humidity. The leaves are often broad and waxy, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Hydrotrophus plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting aquatic ecosystems.</p>
