                    <h1>Hartogia anomala</h1>
<p>Hartogia anomala, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with a single, showy flower that resembles a ghostly figure. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in a thick, waxy layer to retain moisture in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, Hartogia anomala is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
