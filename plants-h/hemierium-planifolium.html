<p>Hemierium planifolium, commonly known as the flat-leaf hemierium, is a species of aquatic plant native to the freshwater regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that float on the water surface, providing habitat for small aquatic organisms. The plant has a simple, branching stem and produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. It is often found in still or slow-moving waters, such as ponds and marshes.</p>
<p>Hemierium planifolium plays a role in water filtration and supports local biodiversity.</p>
