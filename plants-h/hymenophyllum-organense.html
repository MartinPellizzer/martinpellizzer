<p>It is a small, delicate epiphytic plant that thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found on tree trunks and rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hair-like structures.
