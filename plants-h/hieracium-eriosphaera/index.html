                            <h1>Hieracium Eriosphaera</h1>
<p>Hieracium eriosphaera, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a striking member of the daisy family native to southern Africa. This plant is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in dry, rocky environments and is often found in grasslands and coastal areas. Despite its beauty, it can be invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native plants for resources. Its unique appearance and ecological impact make it a subject of both admiration and concern.</p>
