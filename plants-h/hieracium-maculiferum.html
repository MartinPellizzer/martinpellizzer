<p>Hieracium maculiferum, commonly known as the spotted hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it can form dense colonies due to its rhizomatous growth habit. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture, and the flowers are yellow with a distinctive purple or reddish spot at the base.</p>
<p>Hieracium maculiferum is an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems.</p>
