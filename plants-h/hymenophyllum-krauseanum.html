<p>It is characterized by its delicate, narrow, and often hairy leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves and are protected by a specialized covering known as a indusium.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its intricate leaf anatomy and is often found in humid, high-altitude habitats.</p>
