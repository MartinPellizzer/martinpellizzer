<p>Hymenophyllum semifissum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed filmy fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called soridia, are borne on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an important component of epiphytic and lithophytic ecosystems.</p>
