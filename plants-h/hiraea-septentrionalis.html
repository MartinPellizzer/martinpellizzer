<p>Hiraea septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern hiraea, is a rare flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh, cold climates of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Hiraea septentrionalis plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its environment, supporting pollinators and contributing to local biodiversity.</p>
