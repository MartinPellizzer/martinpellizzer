<p>Hieracium pilosella subsp.</p>
<p>dasyphyton, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 cm.</p>
<p>The plant features basal leaves that are broadly ovate with hairy surfaces, and its flowering stems bear yellow composite flowers. It produces small, oval-shaped seeds enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>This subspecies is characterized by its dense foliage and is often found in moist or semi-shaded environments.</p>
