                    <h1>Habenaria hiugensis</h1>
<p>Habenaria hiugensis, commonly known as the Hainan butterfly orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the Hainan Island in China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, butterfly-like flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its flowers are usually pale pink or white, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
