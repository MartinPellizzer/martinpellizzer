<p>Hermannia polymorpha, commonly known as the zigzag plant, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to parts of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, zigzag-shaped stems that help it climb and support itself. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in umbels, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Hermannia polymorpha is often grown as a houseplant due to its compact size and ability to thrive in indirect light.</p>
