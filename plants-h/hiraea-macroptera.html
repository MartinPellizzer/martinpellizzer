<p>Hiraea macroptera, commonly known as the large-leaved hiraea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and marshy areas of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that produce opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a glossy, dark green surface. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to waterlogged soils, enabling it to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Hiraea macroptera is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.</p>
