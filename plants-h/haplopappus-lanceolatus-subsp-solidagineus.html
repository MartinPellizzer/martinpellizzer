<p>Haplopappus lanceolatus subsp.</p>
<p>solidagineus, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots allow it to thrive in poor, sandy soils and withstand periods of drought.</p>
<p>This subspecies is notable for its role in supporting local ecosystems and its resilience in harsh environmental conditions.</p>
