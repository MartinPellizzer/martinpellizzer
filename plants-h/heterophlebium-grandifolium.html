<p>Heterophlebium grandifolium, commonly known as the large-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a soft blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>This unique trait makes it a striking and ecologically significant plant in its habitat.</p>
