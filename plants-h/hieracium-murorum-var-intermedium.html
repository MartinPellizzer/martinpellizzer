                    <h1>Hieracium murorum var. intermedium</h1>
<p>Hieracium murorum var. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate meadow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, sparsely hairy stems and basal rosettes of broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flower heads composed of numerous small florets, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadside banks, and wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its variability in morphology, it is sometimes challenging to distinguish from closely related species within the Hieracium genus.</p>
