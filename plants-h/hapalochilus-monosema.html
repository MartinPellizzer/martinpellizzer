                    <h1>Hapalochilus monosema</h1>
<p>Hapalochilus monosema, commonly known as the single-seeded orchid, is a rare and unique species native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and produces a single, elongated, yellowish-green flower with a distinctive, narrow spur. The plant's most notable botanical feature is its single-seeded capsule, which is unusually large for an orchid and contains only one viable seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to germinate and grow.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Hapalochilus monosema is considered a conservation priority.</p>
