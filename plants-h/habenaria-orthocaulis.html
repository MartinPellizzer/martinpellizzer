<p>Habenaria orthocaulis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland and marsh habitats in eastern North America.</p>
<p>It produces tall, slender stems with few leaves and bears small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, hooded lip. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, relying on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it survive in saturated soils.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ecological role in maintaining wetland biodiversity.</p>
