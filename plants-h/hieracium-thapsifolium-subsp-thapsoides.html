<p>Hieracium thapsifolium subsp.</p>
<p>thapsoides, commonly known as field hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and can form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The plant has basal leaves that are broadly ovate to lanceolate, often with wavy margins, and stems that are usually unbranched. Its yellow flowers are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and it produces small, ribbed achenes with pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive nature.</p>
