<p>Heracleum sublineare, commonly known as narrow-leaved cow parsnip, is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, pinnately divided leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbrella-like clusters called umbels, which bloom in late summer. Its fruits are small, dry, and three-angled, typical of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>Heracleum sublineare is often found in moist meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges.</p>
