<p>Haloragis erecta subsp.</p>
<p>cartilaginea, commonly known as the cartilaginous willow herb, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb characterized by its erect growth habit and hairy, sometimes glandular stems.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are usually narrow and often covered with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its thickened, cartilaginous stem tissue, which gives it its common name.</p>
