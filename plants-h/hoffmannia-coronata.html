                    <h1>Hoffmannia coronata</h1>
<p>Hoffmannia coronata, commonly known as the golden crown cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is covered in dense, yellowish spines that provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves store water, allowing it to thrive in drought conditions.</p>
<p>Hoffmannia coronata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience.</p>
