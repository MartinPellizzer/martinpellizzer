<p>Hensmania stoniella, commonly known as the stone lily, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>This small, terrestrial orchid typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its flowers are characterized by their delicate, white petals and a distinctive yellowish lip, which is a key feature in orchid identification. The plant produces a unique, fragrant scent that attracts specific pollinators, such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hensmania stoniella is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
