                    <h1>Hakea propinqua</h1>
<p>Hakea propinqua, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern and western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody structure and dense, needle-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its seeds are enclosed in woody follicles that open to release the seeds, a feature typical of the Proteaceae family.</p>
<p>Hakea propinqua is often found in sandy soils and is well-suited to coastal and semi-arid habitats.</p>
