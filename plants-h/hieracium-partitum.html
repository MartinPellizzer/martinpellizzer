<p>Hieracium partitum, commonly known as the divided hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its flowers bloom from June to August, and the plant is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes.</p>
<p>Hieracium partitum is also considered a weed in some agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit.</p>
