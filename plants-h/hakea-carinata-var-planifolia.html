<p>It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces cylindrical, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody structure and adaptability to dry conditions make it a resilient species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>The variety planifolia is distinguished by its flattened leaf shape, which sets it apart from other hakea species.</p>
