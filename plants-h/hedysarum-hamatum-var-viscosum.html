<p>Hedysarum hamatum var. viscosum, commonly known as the sticky milkvetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces, and its fruits are pod-like structures that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Hedysarum hamatum var. viscosum plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
