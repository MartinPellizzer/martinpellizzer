                    <h1>Hyperum</h1>
<p>Hyperum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the remote highlands of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that appear to shimmer in the sunlight. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom only at night, attracting specific nocturnal pollinators. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Hyperum is classified as critically endangered, highlighting the need for further research and protection efforts.</p>
