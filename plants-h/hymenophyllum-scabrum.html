<p>Hymenophyllum scabrum, commonly known as the rough leathery fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It features delicate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and covered with a dense, scaly texture. The plant grows on tree trunks and rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum scabrum is valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings.</p>
