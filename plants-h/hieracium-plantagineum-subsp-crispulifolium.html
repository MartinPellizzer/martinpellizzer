<p>Hieracium plantagineum subsp.</p>
<p>crispulifolium, commonly known as the curly-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves that are often curled or crinkled, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in wetlands.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats.</p>
