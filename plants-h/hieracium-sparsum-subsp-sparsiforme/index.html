                            <h1>Hieracium Sparsum Subsp. Sparsiforme</h1>
<p>Hieracium sparsum subsp. sparsiforme is a lesser-known member of the daisy family known for its delicate, sparsely arranged yellow flowers. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, often found in temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. This subspecies is distinguished by its finely divided leaves and a unique floral structure that sets it apart from other Hieracium species. Despite its modest appearance, it plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance. Its subtle beauty and ecological significance make it a fascinating subject for botanical study and conservation efforts.</p>
