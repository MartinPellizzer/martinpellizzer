                    <h1>Heracleum austriacum</h1>
<p>Heracleum austriacum, commonly known as the Austrian cow parsnip, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its hollow, ridged stems and compound leaves with a distinctive fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbels, which develop into small, dry fruits called schizocarps. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along riverbanks and in woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care.</p>
