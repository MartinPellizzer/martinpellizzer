<p>Heliosperma quadridentatum, commonly known as the four-toothed heliosperma, is a species of flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature, contributing to its dispersal in the wild.</p>
