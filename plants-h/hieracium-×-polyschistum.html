<p>Hieracium × polyschistum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it is known for its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Hieracium × polyschistum is a hybrid species, resulting from the cross between different species of hawkweeds, which contributes to its adaptability and variability.</p>
<p>Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and often branched.</p>
