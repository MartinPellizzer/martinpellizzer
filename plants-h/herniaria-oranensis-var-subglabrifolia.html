                    <h1>Herniaria oranensis var. subglabrifolia</h1>
<p>Herniaria oranensis var. subglabrifolia, commonly known as the smooth-leaved sandweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of tiny, white flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with a deep root system that helps it access water from deeper soil layers. Its succulent leaves store moisture, allowing it to thrive in conditions of low rainfall and high temperatures.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its reduced leaf pubescence compared to other forms of Herniaria.</p>
