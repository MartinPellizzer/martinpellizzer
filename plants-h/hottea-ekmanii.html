                    <h1>Hottea ekmanii</h1>
<p>Hottea ekmanii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its delicate, pale green leaves and its striking, white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Hottea ekmanii is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
