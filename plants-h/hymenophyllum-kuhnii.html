<p>Hymenophyllum kuhnii, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of moss belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, velvety fronds that are typically dark green and covered in a fine, silky layer of rhizoids. This moss thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its small, delicate leaves are usually only a few millimeters in length, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum kuhnii plays a role in maintaining soil moisture and supporting microfauna in its native habitats.</p>
