                    <h1>Hymenophyllum dimorphum</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum dimorphum, commonly known as the two-form shield fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive two-tiered structure, where the upper and lower parts differ in morphology. The plant's spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a specialized shield-like covering. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
