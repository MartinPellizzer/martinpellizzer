                    <h1>Hemionitis majestosa</h1>
<p>Hemionitis majestosa, commonly known as the sacred fern, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Hemionitidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, delicate fronds that form a rosette shape, often with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of trichomes. This plant is native to the arid regions of western North America, particularly in California and Nevada, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Hemionitis majestosa is adapted to extreme drought conditions, entering a dormant state during dry periods and resuming growth with the arrival of rain.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of ecosystem health and is protected in many regions.</p>
