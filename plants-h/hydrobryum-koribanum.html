                    <h1>Hydrobryum koribanum</h1>
<p>Hydrobryum koribanum, commonly known as the Koribana water moss, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes, where it anchors itself to submerged surfaces. The plant has thin, ribbon-like leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in width, allowing it to absorb nutrients efficiently from the water. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, relying on water currents for spore dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
