                    <h1>Helia alpestris</h1>
<p>Helia alpestris, commonly known as the alpine helia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh alpine environment. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>H. alpestris is adapted to poor, rocky soils and can thrive at high elevations where few other plants can survive.</p>
