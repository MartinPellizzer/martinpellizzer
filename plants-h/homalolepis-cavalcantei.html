<p>Homalolepis cavalcantei, commonly known as the Brazilian fern, is a rare and endemic species found in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rocky crevices or forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, a common feature in ferns.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Homalolepis cavalcantei is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
