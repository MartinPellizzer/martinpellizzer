                    <h1>Heuffelia bromoides</h1>
<p>Heuffelia bromoides, commonly known as the dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis.</p>
<p>It relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of other species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is considered a rare and elusive species.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological systems by influencing host plant growth and nutrient cycles.</p>
