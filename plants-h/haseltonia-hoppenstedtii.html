                    <h1>Haseltonia hoppenstedtii</h1>
<p>Haseltonia hoppenstedtii, commonly known as the Hoppenstedt's lichen, is a rare and unique lichen species belonging to the family Parmeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a tightly adherent, foliose thallus that often appears as a thin, layered coating on rock surfaces. The plant exhibits a pale yellow to orange-brown coloration, with a distinctive, irregularly bordered structure that aids in its identification. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found on calcareous substrates in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health and ecological stability.</p>
