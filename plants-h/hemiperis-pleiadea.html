                    <h1>Hemiperis pleiadea</h1>
<p>Hemiperis pleiadea, commonly known as the clustered bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat, often found in shallow, still water environments. The plant produces tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms for nutrition. Its leaves are typically submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface.</p>
<p>Hemiperis pleiadea is known for its unique morphology and specialized adaptations for capturing prey in its wetland habitat.</p>
