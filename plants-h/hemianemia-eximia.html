                    <h1>Hemianemia eximia</h1>
<p>Hemianemia eximia, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a rare and highly valued tree species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, reddish-brown heartwood, which is prized for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making it particularly vulnerable to overharvesting. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a leathery texture, while its flowers are small and clustered.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and unsustainable logging, Hemianemia eximia is now classified as critically endangered by conservation organizations.</p>
