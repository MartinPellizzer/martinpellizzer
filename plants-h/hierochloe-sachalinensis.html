<p>Hierochloe sachalinensis, commonly known as the Sakhalin bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Asia, including parts of Russia and Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>
