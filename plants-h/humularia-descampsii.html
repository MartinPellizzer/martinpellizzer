<p>Humularia descampsii, commonly known as the Camps' horned orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, horn-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in cloud forests or along stream banks. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
