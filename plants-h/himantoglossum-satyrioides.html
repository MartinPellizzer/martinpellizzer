<p>Himantoglossum satyrioides, commonly known as the yellow marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its flowering stem is unbranched and bears a single spike of showy, fragrant flowers.</p>
