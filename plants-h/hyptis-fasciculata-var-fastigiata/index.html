                            <h1>Hyptis Fasciculata Var. Fastigiata</h1>
<p>Blue mistflower, scientifically known as Hyptis fasciculata var. fastigiata, is a striking perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It is prized for its delicate, silvery-blue flowers that appear in dense clusters, creating a mist-like appearance. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and shaded woodlands. Its unique color and structure make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking both beauty and ecological value. With its ability to attract pollinators and support local wildlife, blue mistflower is a valuable addition to native plant gardens.</p>
