                    <h1>Hydnophytum formicarum dubium</h1>
<p>Hydnophytum formicarum dubium, commonly known as the ant plant, is a hemi-epiphytic plant that forms a symbiotic relationship with ants.</p>
<p>It produces specialized structures called domatia, which serve as housing for ant colonies. The plant's leaves are modified into leaf-like structures that provide shelter and food for the ants. The ants, in turn, protect the plant from herbivores and help in nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>This unique botanical relationship is a fascinating example of mutualism in tropical ecosystems.</p>
