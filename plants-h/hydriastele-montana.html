                    <h1>Hydriastele montana</h1>
<p>Hydriastele montana, commonly known as the mountain hydriastele, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that collect water, a feature adapted to its humid, high-altitude environment. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red and orange flowers, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss in its cool, misty habitat.</p>
<p>Hydriastele montana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique ecological adaptations.</p>
