                    <h1>Hydrobryum minutale</h1>
<p>Hydrobryum minutale, commonly known as the small liverwort, is a small, aquatic liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, closely packed leaves that form a dense mat on the surface of water or moist soil. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaf-like structures. It thrives in shaded, damp environments and is often found in freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches.</p>
<p>Hydrobryum minutale plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by providing microhabitat for small organisms.</p>
