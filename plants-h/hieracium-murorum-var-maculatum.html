<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has basal rosettes of leaves and produces a taproot system, allowing it to thrive in disturbed soils.

<p>This variant is distinguished by its distinctive reddish or purplish markings on the leaves, which give it its common name.</p>
