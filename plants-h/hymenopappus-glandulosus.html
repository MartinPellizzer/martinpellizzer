                    <h1>Hymenopappus glandulosus</h1>
<p>Hymenopappus glandulosus, commonly known as the hairy hymenopappus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellowish to reddish flowers in clusters, which are followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Hymenopappus glandulosus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native range.</p>
