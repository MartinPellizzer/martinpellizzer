<p>Helianthemum origanifolium subsp.</p>
<p>africanum, commonly known as the African rock rose, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>

<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for Mediterranean and semi-arid climates.</p>
