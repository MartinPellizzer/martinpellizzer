<p>Hieracium intercalare, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family (Asteraceae).</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It produces numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds, allowing it to spread easily.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats.</p>
