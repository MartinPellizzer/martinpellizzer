                    <h1>Haplophyton</h1>
<p>Haplophyton, commonly known as the liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant that belongs to the group known as bryophytes.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments and lacks true roots, stems, and leaves. Instead, it has structures called thallus, which are simple and undifferentiated. Haplophyton reproduces through spores, and its life cycle is dominated by the haploid phase.</p>
<p>These plants play an important role in ecosystems by contributing to soil formation and providing habitats for microorganisms.</p>
