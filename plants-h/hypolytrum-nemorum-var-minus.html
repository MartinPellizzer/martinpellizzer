<p>It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are often hairy and have a distinctive sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid.</p>
