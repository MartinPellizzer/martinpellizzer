<p>Heteropogon leptocladus, commonly known as the slender-leaf hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the wetlands and marshy areas of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in dense mats, often forming part of the vegetation in freshwater wetlands. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and contribute to the ecological health of its habitat.</p>
<p>Heteropogon leptocladus plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for various wetland organisms.</p>
