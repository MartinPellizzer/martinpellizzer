                    <h1>Hemihabenaria susannae</h1>
<p>Hemihabenaria susannae, commonly known as the Susanna's lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spirally arranged leaves and a long, slender flowering stem that produces a cascade of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical or subtropical forests. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Hemihabenaria susannae is considered endangered in many areas.</p>
