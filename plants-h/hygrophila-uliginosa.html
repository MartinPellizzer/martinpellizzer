                    <h1>Hygrophila uliginosa</h1>
<p>Hygrophila uliginosa, commonly known as swamp hygrophila, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in tropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, exhibiting a rhizomatous growth habit that allows it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which are often borne on long, slender stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>Hygrophila uliginosa is valued in aquariums for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in low-light conditions.</p>
