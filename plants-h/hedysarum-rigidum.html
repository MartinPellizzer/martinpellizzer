                    <h1>Hedysarum rigidum</h1>
<p>Hedysarum rigidum, commonly known as the rigid milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with oval leaflets and produces slender, bean-like pods that contain several seeds. Hedysarum rigidum is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobial bacteria.</p>
