<p>Hordeum berteroanum var. pumilum, commonly known as dwarf barley, is a small, annual grass species native to South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its compact growth habit and short, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are generally used for animal feed or as a forage crop in arid regions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in low-nutrient environments.</p>
