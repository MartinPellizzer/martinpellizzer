<p>Hakea cygnus, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage, which helps it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in cylindrical spikes. Its woody structure and ability to thrive in sandy soils make it well adapted to its native environment.</p>
<p>Hakea cygnus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife.</p>
