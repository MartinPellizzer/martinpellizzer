                    <h1>Hudsonia ericoides</h1>
<p>Hudsonia ericoides, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically features small, leathery leaves that are densely packed, providing a dense, mat-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and wind exposure.</p>
<p>Hudsonia ericoides is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
