                    <h1>Halanthium rarifolium var. lilacinum</h1>
<p>Halanthium rarifolium var. lilacinum, commonly known as the lilac-flowered water starwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, delicate leaves that are often submerged or floating. The plant produces tiny, lilac-colored flowers that bloom in the summer months, adding a subtle aesthetic to its habitat. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters with moderate light exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
