<p>Hordeum jubatum subsp.</p>
<p>breviaristatum, commonly known as the short awn wild barley, is a species of grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers with short awns, which are bristle-like structures at the tips of the florets. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in disturbed soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptation to arid environments.</p>
