<p>Hymenolobus procumbens var. maritimus, commonly known as the coastal hymenolobus, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate stems and small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal racemes. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure.</p>
<p>This variant is particularly important for stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
