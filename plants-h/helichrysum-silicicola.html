                    <h1>Helichrysum silicicola</h1>
<p>Helichrysum silicicola, commonly known as the silverleaf helichrysum, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for gardeners in Mediterranean and semi-arid climates.</p>
