                    <h1>Hyparrhenia bracteata</h1>
<p>Hyparrhenia bracteata, commonly known as the African grass or red grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bright green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated, and it thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. Hyparrhenia bracteata is often used for erosion control and as a forage crop for livestock due to its hardiness and rapid growth.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance is significant in maintaining soil stability and supporting local wildlife in its native habitats.</p>
