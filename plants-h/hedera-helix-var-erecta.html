                    <h1>Hedera helix var. erecta</h1>
<p>Hedera helix var. erecta, commonly known as the English ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa.</p>
<p>It features dark green, glossy leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate, with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark blue berries, though it is more valued for its ornamental foliage than its flowering. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in landscaping for its ability to cover walls and trellises.</p>
<p>However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly.</p>
