                    <h1>Hornstedtia lycostoma var. scabra</h1>
<p>Hornstedtia lycostoma var. scabra, commonly known as the rough-hornstedtia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its robust, branched stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, rough hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. It is adapted to survive in dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
