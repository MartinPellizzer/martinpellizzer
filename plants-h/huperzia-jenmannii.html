                    <h1>Huperzia jenmannii</h1>
<p>Huperzia jenmannii, commonly known as the Jenmann's spikemoss, is a member of the family Huperziaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial, evergreen plant characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, needle-like leaves. The plant produces sporangia on specialized structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of the shoots. Huperzia jenmannii thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or on rocky outcrops.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
