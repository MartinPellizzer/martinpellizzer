                    <h1>Hesperantha tugwelliae</h1>
<p>Hesperantha tugwelliae, commonly known as the Tugwell's starling orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant purple and white flowers, which are arranged in a star-like pattern, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hesperantha tugwelliae is considered endangered and is often protected in conservation efforts.</p>
