                    <h1>Hugeria incisa</h1>
<p>Hugeria incisa, commonly known as the narrowleaf huarango, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Hugeria incisa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various desert species.</p>
<p>Its resilience makes it a valuable species for restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
