<p>It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are simple and often have three lobes, giving it the common name.</p>
<p>Hymenostigma tridentatum is a carnivorous plant that relies on both photosynthesis and the absorption of nutrients from captured prey.</p>
