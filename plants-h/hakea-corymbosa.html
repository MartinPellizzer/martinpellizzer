<p>Hakea corymbosa, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and its distinctive, cylindrical or conical flower spikes. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Hakea corymbosa is often found in coastal heathlands and is well-suited to sandy or well-drained soils.</p>
