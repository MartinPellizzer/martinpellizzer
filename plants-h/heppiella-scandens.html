<p>Heppiella scandens, commonly known as the creeping liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Peltasporaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure composed of a flat, ribbon-like stem covered in tiny, leaf-like structures called phyllids. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the upper surface of the thallus.</p>
<p>Heppiella scandens plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates.</p>
