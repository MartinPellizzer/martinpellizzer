                    <h1>Hydrocotyle coriacea</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf water arum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves with a rough, textured surface, which is a distinguishing botanical characteristic. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, adapting to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. Its flowering stems produce small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in a spadix, typical of the Araceae family.</p>
<p>The plant's rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its presence in various wetland habitats.</p>
