                    <h1>Hyoscyamus micranthus</h1>
<p>Hyoscyamus micranthus, commonly known as the lesser henbane, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is an annual herb that typically grows to a height of about 30â€“60 cm, with erect, branched stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by distinctive, spiny fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are palmately lobed and have a somewhat hairy texture.</p>
<p>Hyoscyamus micranthus contains tropane alkaloids, which make it toxic to humans and animals, though it has been used historically in medicinal and ritual contexts.</p>
