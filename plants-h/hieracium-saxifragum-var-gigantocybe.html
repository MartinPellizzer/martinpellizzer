                    <h1>Hieracium saxifragum var. gigantocybe</h1>
<p>Hieracium saxifragum var. gigantocybe, commonly known as the giant hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of hairy, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces tall, leafless stems that bear yellow flowers arranged in a dense, flat-topped inflorescence. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its striking appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments.</p>
