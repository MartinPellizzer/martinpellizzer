                    <h1>Hymenophyllum pectinatum</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum pectinatum, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, moss-like fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a membranous shield.</p>
<p>This species is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings.</p>
