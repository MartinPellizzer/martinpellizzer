                    <h1>Habenaria panigrahiana var. parviloba</h1>
<p>Habenaria panigrahiana var. parviloba, commonly known as the small-lobed marsh orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers are often clustered in loose racemes and are pollinated by various insects, including bees and flies.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this rare orchid is considered threatened in some regions.</p>
