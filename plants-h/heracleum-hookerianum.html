<p>Heracleum hookerianum, commonly known as Hooker's cow parsnip, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant features a tall, hollow stem with distinctive, broadly ovate leaves that have a rough, hairy texture. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in compound umbels, and it produces oval, dry fruits known as schizocarps.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its potential toxicity, with some parts containing furanocoumarins that can cause photodermatitis upon skin contact.</p>
