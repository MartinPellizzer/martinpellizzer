<p>Hieracium praecox subsp.</p>
<p>pinicola, commonly known as the early hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and forest edges, preferring well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are usually hairy and lance-shaped, with a central stem that bears yellow flowers in a composite head. Its flowering period occurs in early summer, and it is often found in association with coniferous trees, hence its subspecific name "pinicola," meaning "pine-loving.".</p>
<p>The species is characterized by its robust growth and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions.</p>
