                    <h1>Haworthia glabrata var. perviridis</h1>
<p>Haworthia glabrata var. perviridis, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with distinct white or yellow markings resembling a zebra's stripes. The leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months.</p>
<p>This plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its minimal water requirements and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light.</p>
