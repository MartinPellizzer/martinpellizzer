<p>Hieracium lachenalii subsp.</p>
<p>pseudochlorophylloides, commonly known as the chlorophyllous hawkweed, is a rare and specialized plant species within the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive yellowish-green foliage, which reflects its unique chlorophyll composition compared to other hawkweeds.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, preferring moist, well-drained soils in rocky or grassy habitats. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in shades of yellow to orange, and it blooms during the summer months.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
