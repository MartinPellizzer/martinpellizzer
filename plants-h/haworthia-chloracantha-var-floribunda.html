                    <h1>Haworthia chloracantha var. floribunda</h1>
<p>Haworthia chloracantha var. floribunda, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a compact, rosette-forming succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features striking, fleshy leaves with distinctive white or yellowish markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers on slender stems during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
