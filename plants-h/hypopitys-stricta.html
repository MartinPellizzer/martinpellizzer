<p>Hypopitys stricta, commonly known as the dwarf larch, is a small coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its unique ability to shed its needles annually, similar to deciduous trees. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in spirals along the stems. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Hypopitys stricta is adapted to harsh alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure.</p>
