<p>Heritiera fomes, commonly known as the Indian mangrove or mangrove fig, is a tropical tree native to the coastal regions of the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fibrous roots that help stabilize coastal soils. The plant thrives in brackish water and can tolerate salt spray, making it an important species in mangrove ecosystems. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a rough texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in panicles.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in wetland environments.</p>
