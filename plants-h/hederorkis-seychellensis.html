<p>Hederorkis seychellensis, commonly known as the Seychelles sea hare, is a species of sea slug found in the coastal waters of the Seychelles.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Aeolidiidae and is characterized by its soft, gelatinous body and vibrant coloration. The plant-like appearance of this organism is due to its ability to absorb and incorporate pigments from its environment, a feature known as chromatophore display. It feeds primarily on sponges and other marine invertebrates, using its radula to scrape food from surfaces.</p>
<p>Hederorkis seychellensis plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to the trophic dynamics of its habitat.</p>
