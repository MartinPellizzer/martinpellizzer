                    <h1>Hexaptera frigida</h1>
<p>Hexaptera frigida, commonly known as the cold-tolerant fern, is a unique plant species adapted to harsh, cold environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that often curl tightly to protect against frost. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically clustered on the underside of the leaves. Hexaptera frigida thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its ability to survive in low-temperature conditions makes it an important indicator species for ecological studies in cold climates.</p>
