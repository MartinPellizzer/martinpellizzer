                    <h1>Hymenophyllum rufofibrillosum</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum rufofibrillosum, commonly known as the red-fibrous shield fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a dense, fibrous rhizome system that helps it anchor to tree trunks and absorb moisture from the air. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>This species thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests.</p>
