                    <h1>Hoya ciliata</h1>
<p>Hoya ciliata, commonly known as the "Snowy Wreath," is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its waxy, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Hoya ciliata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
