<p>Hebe decumbens, commonly known as the prostrate hebe, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, typically during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft texture.</p>
<p>Hebe decumbens is well-suited for rock gardens and as ground cover due to its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers.</p>
