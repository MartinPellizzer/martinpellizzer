                    <h1>Hydrocotyle triflora</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle triflora, commonly known as the three-leaved water shield, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the Americas.</p>
<p>It features trifoliate leaves that are typically floating or submerged, with each leaflet being oval to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, which bloom during the summer months. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize shallow water environments.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle triflora plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians.</p>
