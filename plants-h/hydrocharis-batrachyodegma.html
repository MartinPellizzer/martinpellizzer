<p>Hydrocharis batrachyodegma, commonly known as the dwarf water frog lily, is a floating aquatic plant native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It has small, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with roots submerged in the water. The plant produces pale yellow flowers that bloom above the water, typically in late spring to early summer. It is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in water gardens.</p>
