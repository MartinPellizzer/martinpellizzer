                    <h1>Hedysarum speciosum</h1>
<p>Hedysarum speciosum, commonly known as the showy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of pea-like, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and open woodlands. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions and is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.</p>
<p>Hedysarum speciosum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>
