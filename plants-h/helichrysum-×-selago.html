                    <h1>Helichrysum × selago</h1>
<p>Helichrysum × selago, commonly known as the everlasting daisy or golden marguerite, is a hybrid shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its clusters of small, yellow-orange flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant produces papery, persistent bracts that give it a long-lasting appearance, which is why it is often used in dried floral arrangements. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to retain its color and form even after flowering.</p>
