<p>Hypodematium crenatum subsp.</p>
<p>mehrae, commonly known as the Indian water fern, is a small aquatic fern native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and wetlands.</p>
<p>The plant has finely divided, feathery fronds that help it float on the water's surface. Its reproductive structures are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
