<p>Helichrysum stenocephalum, commonly known as the narrow-headed everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces small, bright yellow to orange flowers that are often retained on the plant even after blooming, giving it a long-lasting appearance. The plant has hairy leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Helichrysum stenocephalum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
