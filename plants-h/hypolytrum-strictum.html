<p>Hypolytrum strictum, commonly known as the narrowleaf marsh grass, is a perennial herb native to wetland environments in Australia.</p>
<p>It features slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are linear, narrow, and slightly folded along the midrib.

Hypolytrum strictum thrives in moist soils and is often found in swampy areas, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in ecological research.</p>
