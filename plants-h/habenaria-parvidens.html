                    <h1>Habenaria parvidens</h1>
<p>Habenaria parvidens, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with faint purple markings. The plant thrives in wetland environments, often growing in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from waterlogged soil, and it plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>
<p>The orchid is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and limited distribution.</p>
