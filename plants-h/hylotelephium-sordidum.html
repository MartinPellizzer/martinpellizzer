<p>Hylotelephium sordidum, commonly known as the purple stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, silver-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
