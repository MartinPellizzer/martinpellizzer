                    <h1>Halothamnus acutifolius</h1>
<p>Halothamnus acutifolius, commonly known as sharp-leaved halothamnus, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a common sight in dry, coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its resilience to drought and salt makes it an important component of coastal and semi-arid ecosystems.</p>
