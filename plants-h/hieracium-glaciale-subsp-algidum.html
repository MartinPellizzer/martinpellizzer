<p>Hieracium glaciale subsp.</p>
<p>algidum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps and other mountainous areas. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence, adapted to withstand cold and windy conditions. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species of high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
