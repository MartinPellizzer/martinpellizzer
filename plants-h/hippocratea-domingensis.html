<p>Hippocratea domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are lance-shaped and革质 (leathery), providing structural support and water retention in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this unique botanical species.</p>
