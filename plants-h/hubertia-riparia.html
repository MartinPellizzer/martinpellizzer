<p>Hubertia riparia, commonly known as the river hubertia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, succulent growth habit and produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. It typically grows along riverbanks and rocky outcrops, where it can access moisture.</p>
<p>Hubertia riparia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in xeriscapes due to its drought tolerance.</p>
