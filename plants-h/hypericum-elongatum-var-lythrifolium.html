<p>Hypericum elongatum var. lythrifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are narrow and elliptic, often with a slightly waxy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable plant for rock gardens or borders.</p>
