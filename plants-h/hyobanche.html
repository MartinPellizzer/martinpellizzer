                    <h1>Hyobanche</h1>
<p>Hyobanche, commonly known as Indian knapweed, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. The plant produces small, often yellow or white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its roots are specialized for penetrating the host's vascular system, allowing it to extract water and minerals.</p>
<p>Hyobanche is native to parts of Asia and is considered a rare and delicate species in its natural habitat.</p>
