<p>Hydrocotyle multicaulis, commonly known as the marsh mallow or water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist soils.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle multicaulis is often found in marshes, stream banks, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
