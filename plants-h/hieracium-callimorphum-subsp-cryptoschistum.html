<p>Hieracium callimorphum subsp.</p>
<p>cryptoschistum, commonly known as the cryptoschistum hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy, often glandular leaves.</p>
<p>This subspecies is typically found in grassy habitats, such as meadows and woodland edges, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It has a rosette growth form with basal leaves and produces a flowering stem that bears numerous small, yellow florets.</p>
<p>The plant is relatively short-lived and can be difficult to distinguish from other hawkweed species due to its subtle morphological features.</p>
