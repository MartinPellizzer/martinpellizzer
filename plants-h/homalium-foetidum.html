                    <h1>Homalium foetidum</h1>
<p>Homalium foetidum, commonly known as the stinkwood or foul-smelling holly, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces woody capsules that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its name derives from the strong, unpleasant odor emitted by its flowers, which can be both a deterrent to herbivores and a means of attracting certain pollinators.</p>
<p>The tree is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its durable wood.</p>
