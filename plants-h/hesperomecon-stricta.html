                    <h1>Hesperomecon stricta</h1>
<p>Hesperomecon stricta, commonly known as the strict milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright, branching stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Hesperomecon stricta is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with root nodules.</p>
<p>Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed areas.</p>
