<p>Hyoseris radiata var. blechnoides, commonly known as the fern-like dandelion, is a variant of the common dandelion with distinctive foliage resembling that of a fern.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, serrated leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that develop into fluffy white pappi, aiding in wind pollination and seed dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides.</p>
<p>The leaves and flowers are edible, though the plant is less commonly cultivated than other dandelion varieties.</p>
