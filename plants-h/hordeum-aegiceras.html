<p>Hordeum aegiceras, commonly known as saltwater barley, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of Asia and Australia.</p>
<p>It is adapted to saline and brackish environments, making it a halophyte capable of thriving in high-sodium soils. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its small, spikelet-based inflorescence produces grains that are typically wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Hordeum aegiceras plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species.</p>
