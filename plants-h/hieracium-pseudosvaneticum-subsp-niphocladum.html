<p>Hieracium pseudosvaneticum subsp.</p>
<p>niphocladum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit and yellowish to reddish flowering heads.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its hairy stems and leaves, which help it survive in cold, high-altitude environments. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native habitat.</p>
