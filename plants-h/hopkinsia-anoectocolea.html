                    <h1>Hopkinsia anoectocolea</h1>
<p>Hopkinsia anoectocolea, commonly known as the slender swamp fern, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in waterlogged environments, while its spore-producing structures are clustered at the base of the fronds.</p>
<p>Hopkinsia anoectocolea plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
