<p>Hakea filipendula, commonly known as the silver-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, silvery-blue foliage and cylindrical, woody fruiting structures. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its adaptations to arid environments include reduced leaf size and deep root systems for water storage.</p>
<p>Hakea filipendula is often used in coastal and dryland landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
