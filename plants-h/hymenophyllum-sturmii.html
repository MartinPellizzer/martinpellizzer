                    <h1>Hymenophyllum sturmii</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum sturmii, commonly known as the stromboid fern, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, moss-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a distinctive, elongated, and often curved shape, with a unique morphology that resembles a snail shell, hence its common name. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are arranged in a linear pattern on the underside of the fronds.</p>
