<p>Hieracium nordlandicum, commonly known as northern hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to northern regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and forest edges. Its yellow-orange flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Hieracium nordlandicum is often considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
