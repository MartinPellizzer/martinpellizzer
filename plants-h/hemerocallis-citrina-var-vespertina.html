                    <h1>Hemerocallis citrina var. vespertina</h1>
<p>Hemerocallis citrina var. vespertina, commonly known as the evening glory daylily, is a herbaceous perennial native to China.</p>
<p>It features strap-like, bright yellow leaves that provide a striking contrast to its showy, orange-red flowers. The plant produces large, trumpet-shaped blooms that open in the late afternoon and close by evening, hence its common name. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation in gardens.</p>
