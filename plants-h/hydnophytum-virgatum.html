<p>Hydnophytum virgatum, commonly known as the sticky wood sorrel, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its unique morphology, including its sticky, glandular hairs on the stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in cymes, and its fruits are capsules that release tiny seeds. Hydnophytum virgatum is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and wetlands.</p>
<p>It is also known for its ability to form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing its growth in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
