<p>Halimium alyssoides var. rugosum, commonly known as the rough-hairy sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine, rough hairs. The plant produces clusters of pinkish-white, bell-shaped flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with specific horticultural conditions.</p>
