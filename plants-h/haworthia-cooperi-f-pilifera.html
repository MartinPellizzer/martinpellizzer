<p>Haworthia cooperi f. pilifera, commonly known as the feather plant, is a compact, rosette-forming succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features short, fleshy leaves with white to yellowish tubercles and a dense covering of fine, hair-like structures called trichomes, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or yellow during the growing season. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to maintain its vibrant foliage.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
