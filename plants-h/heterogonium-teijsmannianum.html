<p>Heterogonium teijsmannianum, commonly known as the Java liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a thalloid liverwort, meaning it has a flat, leaf-like structure rather than true leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures include both male and female gametophytes, which are essential for its sexual reproduction.</p>
<p>The plant's morphology and habitat preferences make it an important species in studies of bryophyte ecology and evolution.</p>
