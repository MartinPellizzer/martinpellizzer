                <h1>Helianthemum sulphureum</h1>
<p>Helianthemum sulphureum, commonly known as the sulfur-flowered sandthorn, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It produces small, yellow flowers that are often tinged with orange or sulfur-yellow, giving it its common name. The plant has needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Helianthemum sulphureum is adapted to full sun and is relatively drought-tolerant.</p>
