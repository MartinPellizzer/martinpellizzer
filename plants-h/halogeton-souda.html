<p>Halogeton souda, commonly known as the Souda saltbush, is a halophytic shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fleshy, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, and it is adapted to thrive in saline soils. Halogeton souda is often found in coastal dunes, salt lakes, and other saline habitats.</p>
<p>Its ability to tolerate extreme drought and high salinity makes it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
