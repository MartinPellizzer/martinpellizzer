                    <h1>Hymenochaeta haematodes</h1>
<p>Hymenochaeta haematodes, commonly known as the red-staining bracket fungus, is a member of the family Hymenochaetaceae.</p>
<p>It is a wood-rotting basidiomycete that typically grows on decaying hardwoods, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. The fruiting bodies are small, bracket-shaped, and have a reddish-brown color that may darken with age. The hymenophore is smooth and lacks a distinct stem, and the spores are released from the pores on the underside of the cap.</p>
<p>This fungus plays an important ecological role in breaking down dead wood and recycling nutrients in forest ecosystems.</p>
