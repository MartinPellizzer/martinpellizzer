<p>Hygrophila caerulea, commonly known as blue hygrophila, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant blue-green leaves and slender, branching stems that often float on the water surface. This plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can receive adequate sunlight. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
