                    <h1>Holcus tuberosus</h1>
<p>Holcus tuberosus, commonly known as yellow nut sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its triangular, tuberous rhizomes and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, nut-like tubers underground, which serve as a storage organ for nutrients. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it often grows in moist, disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Holcus tuberosus is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly.</p>
