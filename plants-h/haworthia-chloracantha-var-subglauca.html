<p>Haworthia chloracantha var. subglauca, commonly known as the Blue Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense rosettes of fleshy, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery waxy coating. The leaves are typically shorter and more rounded compared to the standard variety, giving it a more compact appearance. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers on slender stems during the growing season.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
