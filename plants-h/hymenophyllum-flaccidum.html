                    <h1>Hymenophyllum flaccidum</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum flaccidum, commonly known as the flaccid moss, is a delicate fern belonging to the Hymenophyllaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of hair, giving it a soft, almost velvety appearance. This epiphytic plant typically grows on the bark of trees in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are borne on the underside of its fronds and are clustered in small, circular groups known as sori.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and habitat requirements make it an important component of forest understory ecosystems.</p>
