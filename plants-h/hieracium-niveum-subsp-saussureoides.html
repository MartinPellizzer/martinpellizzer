<p>saussureoides, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosettes of lanceolate, silver-white leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow disc flowers surrounded by ray florets, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
