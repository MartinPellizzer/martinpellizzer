<p>Huernia somalica, commonly known as the Somalian moon cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Somalia and Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems that store water. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are often reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Huernia somalica is well adapted to dry climates and requires minimal watering, making it a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts.</p>
