<p>Halotis pilosa, commonly known as the hairy saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to minimize transpiration. It produces small, greenish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, fleshy fruits.</p>
<p>Halotis pilosa plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in dry landscapes.</p>
