<p>Huernia scabra var. ecornuta, commonly known as the horned ice plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically cylindrical and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its lack of spines, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections.</p>
