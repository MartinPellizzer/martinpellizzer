                    <h1>Hieracium ischnolepis</h1>
<p>Hieracium ischnolepis, commonly known as the narrowleaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy surface, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Hieracium ischnolepis is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some regions.</p>
