<p>Hieracium × latisquamum subsp.</p>
<p>acrocladium, commonly known as the broad-scaled hawkweed, is a hybrid species within the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its robust growth and distinctive, broad, overlapping leaf blades that give it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant typically produces yellow flowers arranged in dense, flat-topped clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as meadows and roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits variability in morphology, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
