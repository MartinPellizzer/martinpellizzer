                    <h1>Helleborine palustris f. ericetorum</h1>
<p>Helleborine palustris f. ericetorum, commonly known as the bog helleborine, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to wetland habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant thrives in acidic, boggy soils and is often found in heathland or peat moss environments. Its morphology is adapted to its moist, nutrient-poor habitat, with a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in soft, waterlogged ground.</p>
<p>Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
