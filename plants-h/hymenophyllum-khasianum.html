                    <h1>Hymenophyllum khasianum</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum khasianum, commonly known as the Khasi fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, glossy, and often translucent fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in the Himalayas and northeastern India. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an important component of epiphytic and terrestrial ecosystems.</p>
