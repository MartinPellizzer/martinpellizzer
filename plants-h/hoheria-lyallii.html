                    <h1>Hoheria lyallii</h1>
<p>Hoheria lyallii, commonly known as the Lyall's honeysuckle, is a shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds, particularly the native honeyeaters. Its leaves are oval-shaped and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Hoheria lyallii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.</p>
