                    <h1>Herminium unalascense</h1>
<p>Herminium unalascense, commonly known as the Alaskan lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Alaska and northern Canada.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of grass-like leaves and produces a dense, spiraled inflorescence of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in bogs and along streambanks. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it plays a role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
