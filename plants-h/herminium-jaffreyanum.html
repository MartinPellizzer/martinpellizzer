<p>Herminium jaffreyanum, commonly known as the Jaffrey's spire orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and a single, showy flower that typically blooms in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette at the base of the stem. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
