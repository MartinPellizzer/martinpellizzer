                    <h1>Hubera cerasoides</h1>
<p>Hubera cerasoides, commonly known as the cherry laurel or cherry ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that turn yellow in the fall, and its clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans and livestock. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping, though its toxicity requires caution in cultivation.</p>
