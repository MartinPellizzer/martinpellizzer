                    <h1>Helianthemum rotundifolium</h1>
<p>Helianthemum rotundifolium, commonly known as the rounded-leaf sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, helping it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
