                    <h1>Hieracium inaequilaterum</h1>
<p>Hieracium inaequilaterum, commonly known as the unequal-armed hawkweed, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes, it can become invasive in certain areas.</p>
