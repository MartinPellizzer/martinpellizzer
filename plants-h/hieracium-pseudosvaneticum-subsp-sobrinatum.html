<p>Hieracium pseudosvaneticum subsp.</p>
<p>sobrinatum, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy, basal leaves.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in harsh environmental conditions. It produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal, aiding in its spread across mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native habitat.</p>
