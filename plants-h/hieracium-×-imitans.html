                    <h1>Hieracium × imitans</h1>
<p>Hieracium × imitans, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a hybrid plant in the sunflower family (Asteraceae).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellow flowers and heart-shaped leaves, which resemble those of the common dandelion. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. It can be invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes.</p>
<p>Botanically, it exhibits variability in leaf shape and flower size, making it a subject of interest in plant taxonomy.</p>
