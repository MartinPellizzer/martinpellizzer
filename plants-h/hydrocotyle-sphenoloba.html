                    <h1>Hydrocotyle sphenoloba</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle sphenoloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water shield, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of North America.</p>
<p>It features floating leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a waxy surface to repel water. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Its roots help stabilize the sediment in shallow waters, contributing to aquatic ecosystem health.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle sphenoloba is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats.</p>
