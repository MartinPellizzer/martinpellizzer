                    <h1>Hydrocotyle pauciflora</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle pauciflora, commonly known as the small-leaved water pennywort, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of smooth, heart-shaped leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in diameter. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, which are pollinated by insects. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily in moist soils, often forming dense mats.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle pauciflora is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions, with its leaves floating or submerged depending on the water level.</p>
