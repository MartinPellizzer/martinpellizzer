<p>It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Its unique morphology and habitat make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
