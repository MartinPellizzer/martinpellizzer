                    <h1>Hedysarum herbaceum</h1>
<p>Hedysarum herbaceum, commonly known as the creeping yellow vetch, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by cylindrical pods containing several seeds. Its trifoliate leaves consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Hedysarum herbaceum is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and erosion control.</p>
