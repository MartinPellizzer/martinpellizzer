                    <h1>Hexastylis shuttleworthii</h1>
<p>Hexastylis shuttleworthii, commonly known as the shuttleworth's hooded fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of its leaves. Native to the southeastern United States, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
