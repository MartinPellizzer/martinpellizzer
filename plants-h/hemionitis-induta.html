<p>Hemionitis induta, commonly known as the Indian water fern, is a unique aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Hemionitis induta is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
