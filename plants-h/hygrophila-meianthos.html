                    <h1>Hygrophila meianthos</h1>
<p>Hygrophila meianthos, commonly known as the slender water hyssop, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of blue or purple. The plant thrives in wet or semi-aquatic environments, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it an effective colonizer of disturbed wetlands.</p>
<p>Hygrophila meianthos is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses in some cultures.</p>
