<p>Hieracium auricula subsp.</p>
<p>acutisquamum, commonly known as the sharp-scaled hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves that are broadly ovate with a distinctive, sharply toothed margin.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in a single, erect head, which is surrounded by a series of bracts. It thrives in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
