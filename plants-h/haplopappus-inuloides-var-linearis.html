<p>Haplopappus inuloides var. linearis, commonly known as the linearleaf goatweed, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features slender, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its flowering period usually occurs in the spring and early summer, and it is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.</p>
<p>The species is characterized by its low-growing habit and drought tolerance, making it a common weed in arid landscapes.</p>
