                    <h1>Hoya rupicola</h1>
<p>Hoya rupicola, commonly known as the rock hoya, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy, ovate leaves that are often variegated with shades of green and white. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in clusters, typically in shades of pink or white, during the warmer months. Hoya rupicola thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal.</p>
