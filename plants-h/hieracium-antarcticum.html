<p>Hieracium antarcticum, commonly known as Antarctic hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southern regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as the Andes, where it thrives in cold, arid conditions. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves and produces yellow flowers in late summer. Its small, hairy leaves help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Hieracium antarcticum is adapted to survive in extreme climates with minimal moisture and intense sunlight.</p>
