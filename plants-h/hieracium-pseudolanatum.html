<p>Hieracium pseudolanatum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant features basal rosettes of serrated, lance-shaped leaves and produces bright yellow ray flowers surrounded by tubular florets. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
