<p>Hieracium aleiatolepium, commonly known as the Aleiatolepium hawkweed, is a rare and specialized member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy, often lobed leaves, which are adaptations to its specific ecological niche. This plant is typically found in alpine or subalpine regions, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its growth habit is low and spreading, with a rosette of basal leaves that help it conserve moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
