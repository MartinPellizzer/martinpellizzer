                    <h1>Haloxanthium</h1>
<p>Haloxanthium, commonly known as the sand sedge, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with slender, often hairy stems and small, scale-like leaves. The flowers are typically clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and the plants are adapted to grow in sandy or disturbed soils. Haloxanthium species are often found in arid or semi-arid regions, where they play a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion.</p>
<p>These plants are generally short-lived perennials, with some species exhibiting rhizomatous growth patterns.</p>
