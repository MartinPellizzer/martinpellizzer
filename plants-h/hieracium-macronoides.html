                    <h1>Hieracium macronoides</h1>
<p>Hieracium macronoides, commonly known as the large-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in open woodlands.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas.</p>
