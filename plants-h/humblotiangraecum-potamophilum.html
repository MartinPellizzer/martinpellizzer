                    <h1>Humblotiangraecum potamophilum</h1>
<p>Humblotiangraecum potamophilum, commonly known as the riverbank beauty, is a rare flowering plant native to the wetlands of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils along riverbanks and swampy areas. The plant produces striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive.</p>
