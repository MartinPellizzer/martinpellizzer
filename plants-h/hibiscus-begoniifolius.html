                    <h1>Hibiscus begoniifolius</h1>
<p>Hibiscus begoniifolius, commonly known as the begonia-leaved hibiscus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of begonias, hence its common name. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom throughout the warm seasons. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Hibiscus begoniifolius is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its striking foliage and vibrant blooms.</p>
