<p>Helictotrichon hackelii var. algarbiense, commonly known as the Algarbiense needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and sandy soils. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil in arid regions.</p>
