                    <h1>Huernia scabra var. longula</h1>
<p>Huernia scabra var. longula, commonly known as the horned ice plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ribbed, cylindrical stems that resemble horns, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which minimize water loss and protect it from herbivores.</p>
<p>This species is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance.</p>
