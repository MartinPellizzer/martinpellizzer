<p>Horkelia fusca subsp. pseudocapitata is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the western united states. it belongs to the campanulaceae family and is known for its small, blue-violet blossoms that bloom in late spring. this subspecies is often found in rocky soils and open meadows, thriving in cool, moist environments. due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered in many regions. its unique appearance and ecological significance make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
