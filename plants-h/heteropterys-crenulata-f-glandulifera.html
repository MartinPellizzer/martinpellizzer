                    <h1>Heteropterys crenulata f. glandulifera</h1>
<p>Heteropterys crenulata f. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular-leafed heteropterys, is a variant of the species native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, lobed leaves that are often covered in glandular hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in inflorescences, and are typically white or pale pink in color.</p>
<p>The glandular structures on the leaves may play a role in defense against herbivores or in water retention.</p>
