                    <h1>Hordeum polystichon</h1>
<p>Hordeum polystichon, commonly known as the mountain barley, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikelets that are arranged in dense, panicle-like clusters, with small, wind-pollinated flowers. Hordeum polystichon is adapted to cold and alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils at higher elevations.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of mountain ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology.</p>
