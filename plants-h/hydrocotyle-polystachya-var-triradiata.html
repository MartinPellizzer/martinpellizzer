                    <h1>Hydrocotyle polystachya var. triradiata</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle polystachya var. triradiata, commonly known as the three-rayed water pennywort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are typically floating or emergent, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that are borne on slender stems, often near the water's surface. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats.</p>
<p>It is often found in ponds, marshes, and along the edges of streams, where it plays a role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
