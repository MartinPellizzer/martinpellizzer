<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and typically grows on the branches of trees and shrubs. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers. Its berries are often eaten by birds, which aid in seed dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can affect the health of its host plants if left unchecked.</p>
