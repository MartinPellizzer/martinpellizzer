<p>Hieracium athroadenioides, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white to pale yellow hairs on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions.</p>
