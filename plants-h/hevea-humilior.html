<p>Hevea humilior, commonly known as the low hevea, is a small tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing seeds. It is often found in lowland forests and is adapted to humid, tropical climates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited size and specific habitat, it is less commonly cultivated compared to other hevea species.</p>
