<p>Haemanthus virescens var. albiflos, commonly known as the white-flowered red-hot poker, is a striking evergreen perennial native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features tall, upright stems that bear dense clusters of bright red bracts, which are actually modified leaves, surrounding small, white, tubular flowers. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped blooms in late summer to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette, adding texture to the landscape.</p>
<p>It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.</p>
