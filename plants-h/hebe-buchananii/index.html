                            <h1>Hebe Buchananii</h1>
<p>Hebe buchananii is a striking evergreen shrub native to New Zealand, known for its vibrant blue or purple flowers that bloom in spring. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners in temperate climates. Its compact growth habit and long-lasting blooms make it an excellent addition to rock gardens or as a border plant. Hebe buchananii is also valued for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Despite its beauty, it requires careful pruning to maintain its shape and encourage repeat flowering.</p>
