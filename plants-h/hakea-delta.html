                    <h1>Hakea delta</h1>
<p>Hakea delta, commonly known as the delta hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage and unique, woody flower spikes that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red or yellow flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a leathery texture, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Hakea delta is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.</p>
