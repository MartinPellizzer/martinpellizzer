                    <h1>Hemerocallis × exilis</h1>
<p>Hemerocallis × exilis, commonly known as the dwarf daylily, is a compact perennial plant native to China.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant blooms in early summer, with each flower lasting only one day, hence its common name. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a border plant due to its low-growing habit.</p>
<p>Hemerocallis × exilis is relatively easy to grow, requiring well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade.</p>
