                    <h1>Hymenasplenium hoffmannii</h1>
<p>Hymenasplenium hoffmannii, commonly known as the Hoffmann's spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its delicate, closely spaced leaves that form a dense, carpet-like growth. The plant's leaves are typically elongated and have a smooth, waxy surface, which helps it retain moisture in its habitat. Hymenasplenium hoffmannii is often found on soil, rocks, or decaying wood in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, called capsules, are borne on short stalks and release spores when mature.</p>
