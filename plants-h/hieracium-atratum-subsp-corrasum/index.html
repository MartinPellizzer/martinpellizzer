                            <h1>Hieracium Atratum Subsp. Corrasum</h1>
<p>Hieracium atratum subsp. corrasum is a rare and lesser-known species of hawkweed found primarily in mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dark purple to blackish flowers and hairy stems, which distinguish it from other members of the genus. This subspecies thrives in rocky and acidic soils, often growing in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes. Conservation efforts are essential to protect this unique plant from threats such as habitat loss and climate change.</p>
