                    <h1>Hieracium saxatile var. ucenicum</h1>
<p>Hieracium saxatile var. ucenicum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, alpine, and subalpine habitats, often on slopes and cliffs. The plant features a compact rosette of basal leaves that are covered in dense, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. It produces yellow flowers in a single inflorescence at the end of the stem, which bloom from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its smaller stature and more compact growth compared to other members of the Hieracium genus.</p>
