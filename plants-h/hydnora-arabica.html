                    <h1>Hydnora arabica</h1>
<p>Hydnora arabica, commonly known as the desert candle, is a parasitic plant found primarily in arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing within the stems of other plants. The plant produces a unique, fleshy, reddish structure that resembles a candle, which serves as a specialized flower. Its flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators such as flies.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, Hydnora arabica is a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
