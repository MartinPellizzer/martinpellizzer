                    <h1>Hymenocrater altimuranus</h1>
<p>Hymenocrater altimuranus, commonly known as the cloud mountain orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in cloud forests and mountainous terrains. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers with a unique structure that facilitates specific pollination by certain insect species. Its growth is slow, and it requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
