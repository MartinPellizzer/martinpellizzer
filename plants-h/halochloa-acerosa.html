                    <h1>Halochloa acerosa</h1>
<p>Halochloa acerosa, commonly known as the sharpleaf saltgrass, is a halophytic grass species adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It is native to coastal areas of Australia and thrives in soils with high salt content. The plant has narrow, rigid leaves with a prominent midrib, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Halochloa acerosa plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing soil erosion.</p>
