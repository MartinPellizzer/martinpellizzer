                    <h1>Hymenopappus nudipes var. alpestris</h1>
<p>Hymenopappus nudipes var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine hymenopappus, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, reducing water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is adapted to rocky, alpine soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats at elevations above 3,000 meters.</p>
