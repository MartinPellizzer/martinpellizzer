<p>Haageocereus pseudomelanostele subsp.</p>
<p>chryseus, commonly known as the golden column cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a tall, cylindrical stem that is typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in inflorescences at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to absorb moisture from infrequent rains.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in dry conditions.</p>
