                    <h1>Heteroderis</h1>
<p>Heteroderis, commonly known as the root knot nematode, is a type of microscopic roundworm that infects the roots of various plants.</p>
<p>These nematodes feed on plant cells, causing galls or knots to form on the roots, which can severely impact the plant's ability to absorb water and nutrients. Heteroderis species are widespread and can affect a wide range of crops, including vegetables, fruits, and ornamental plants. They are particularly problematic in warm climates and can persist in soil for several years.</p>
<p>Management often involves crop rotation, resistant varieties, and soil fumigation to reduce their population.</p>
