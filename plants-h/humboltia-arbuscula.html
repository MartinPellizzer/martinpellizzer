                    <h1>Humboltia arbuscula</h1>
<p>Humboltia arbuscula, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pale green, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Humboltia arbuscula is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions with minimal water, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptation to extreme environmental conditions.</p>
