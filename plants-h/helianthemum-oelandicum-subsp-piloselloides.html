<p>Helianthemum oelandicum subsp.</p>
<p>piloselloides, commonly known as the rough stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to southern Europe. It features fleshy, gray-green leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or inland Mediterranean climates.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
