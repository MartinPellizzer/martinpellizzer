<p>Heracleum sphondylium var. pyrenaicum, commonly known as the Pyrenean cow parsley, is a perennial herb native to the Pyrenees region.</p>
<p>It features a tall, hollow stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height, often with a reddish tinge. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped umbel, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of other members of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its smaller stature and more compact inflorescence compared to the typical form of Heracleum sphondylium.</p>
