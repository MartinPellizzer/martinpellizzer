                    <h1>Hydrocotyle felipae</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle felipae, commonly known as the Mexican water shield, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Central America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has floating leaves that are palmately lobed, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Its roots are anchored in the substrate, and it produces small white flowers during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle felipae plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration.</p>
