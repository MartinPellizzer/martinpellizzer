                    <h1>Helianthemum glaucum</h1>
<p>Helianthemum glaucum, commonly known as the silver thyme or coastal helianthemum, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in spring and early summer. The plant has dense, silver-gray foliage that is both drought-tolerant and heat-resistant, making it well-suited for rocky or coastal environments. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Helianthemum glaucum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and aromatic properties.</p>
