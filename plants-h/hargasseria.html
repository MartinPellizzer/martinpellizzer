                    <h1>Hargasseria</h1>
<p>Hargasseria, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often colorful flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. Native to southern Africa, Hargasseria species typically thrive in rocky or sandy soils and are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. The plants have a short-lived rhizome and produce small, tubular flowers that attract specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, several species within this genus are considered endangered.</p>
