<p>Hormuzakia aggregata, commonly known as the Persian sandthorn, is a shrub native to arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, yellowish-green leaves adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by small, fleshy fruits. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used for erosion control in degraded landscapes.</p>
