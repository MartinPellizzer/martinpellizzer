                    <h1>Helianthus annuus var. revolutus</h1>
<p>Helianthus annuus var. revolutus, commonly known as the curledleaf sunflower, is a variant of the common sunflower characterized by its distinctive, tightly curled leaves.</p>
<p>This variety is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces large, yellow flower heads that follow the sun's movement, a trait known as heliotropism. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a fuzzy texture, and it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>The curledleaf sunflower is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
