                    <h1>Heteranthera hydrocleifolia</h1>
<p>Heteranthera hydrocleifolia, commonly known as water thyme, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It features small, bright green leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces tiny, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread quickly, making it both a valuable aquatic plant and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats.</p>
