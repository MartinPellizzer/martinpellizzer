                    <h1>Hemianemia dimorphostachys</h1>
<p>Hemianemia dimorphostachys, commonly known as the two-stemmed hemianthus, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its two distinct stem forms—dwarf and tall—give it its scientific name, reflecting its morphological variation.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
