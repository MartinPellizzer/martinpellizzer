                    <h1>Hexalectris colemanii</h1>
<p>Hexalectris colemanii, commonly known as Coleman's false morel, is a rare and elusive member of the Coriolaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a mycorrhizal fungus that forms symbiotic relationships with specific tree species, primarily oaks. The plant's unique morphology includes a cap that resembles a brain-like structure, with a spongy, hollow interior. It thrives in the southeastern United States, particularly in moist, shaded forest floors.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
