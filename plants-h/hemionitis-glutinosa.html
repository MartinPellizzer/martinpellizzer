<p>Hemionitis glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its floating, bladder-like structures that trap small organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant has thin, delicate leaves that are often covered in a sticky substance, which helps in adhesion to surfaces. It typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>Hemionitis glutinosa is known for its unique morphology and ecological role in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
