<p>Hieracium rauzense subsp.</p>
<p>pseudarolae, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming basal leaves and yellow composite flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from other Hieracium species, particularly in leaf structure and flower morphology.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in mountain ecosystems.</p>
