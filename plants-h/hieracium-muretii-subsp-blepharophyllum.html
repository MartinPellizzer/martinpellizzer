<p>Hieracium muretii subsp.</p>
<p>blepharophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>The plant has slender, upright stems and small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in dense clusters. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and floral characteristics compared to other hawkweed species.</p>
