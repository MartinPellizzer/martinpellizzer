<p>Haworthiopsis scabra var. smitii, commonly known as the Smit's Haworthia, is a compact, evergreen succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of thick, fleshy, bluish-green leaves with a distinctive white or pale yellow margin. The plant produces tall, slender flower stalks with small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
