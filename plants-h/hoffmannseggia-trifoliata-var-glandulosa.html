                    <h1>Hoffmannseggia trifoliata var. glandulosa</h1>
<p>Hoffmannseggia trifoliata var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular leafed hoffmannseggia, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are divided into three leaflets, and the presence of glandular structures on its foliage.
