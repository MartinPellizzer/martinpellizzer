                    <h1>Halocharis</h1>
<p>Halocharis, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plants are characterized by their compact, shrub-like growth habit and showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Halocharis species are drought-tolerant and have small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>These plants are often used in xeriscaping due to their low maintenance and ornamental value.</p>
