<p>Heracleum sisianense, commonly known as the Sisian hogweed, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its large, umbrella-like inflorescences and hollow stems.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus, including Armenia and Georgia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant can grow up to 2 meters tall, with broad, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in a flat-topped cluster, and it produces a fruit that is a dry, two-lobed schizocarp.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it is considered a potentially dangerous plant, requiring caution when handling.</p>
