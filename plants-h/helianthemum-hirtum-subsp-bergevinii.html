<p>Helianthemum hirtum subsp.</p>
<p>bergevinii, commonly known as the Bergevin stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a delicate touch to rocky or gravelly habitats. It is often found in alpine and subalpine areas, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and as a drought-tolerant ground cover.</p>
