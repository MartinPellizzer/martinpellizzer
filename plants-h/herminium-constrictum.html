                    <h1>Herminium constrictum</h1>
<p>Herminium constrictum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twayblade, is a perennial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is a hemiparasite, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows.</p>
<p>Its unique botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical study.</p>
