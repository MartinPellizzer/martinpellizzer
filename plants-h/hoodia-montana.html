<p>Hoodia montana, commonly known as the desert cucumber, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spineless, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are reduced to small scales, and it has a deep root system to access underground moisture.</p>
<p>Hoodia montana is also known for its potential medicinal properties, particularly in relation to appetite suppression.</p>
