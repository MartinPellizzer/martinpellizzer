<p>Hakea lasiocarpha, commonly known as the woolly hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Hakea lasiocarpha is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions of its native habitat.</p>
