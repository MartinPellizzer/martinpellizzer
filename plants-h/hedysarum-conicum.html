                    <h1>Hedysarum conicum</h1>
<p>Hedysarum conicum, commonly known as the narrowleaf sweetclover, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, raceme-like clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Hedysarum conicum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
<p>Its ecological significance includes providing forage for wildlife and supporting pollinator populations.</p>
