<p>Hierochloe monticola, commonly known as mountain bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high elevations, often forming dense mats or low tufts. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves and produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine zones.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>
