                    <h1>Horminum occidentale</h1>
<p>Horminum occidentale, commonly known as the Western Hormin, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and clusters of small, pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a cool, moist environment to flourish. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overcollection, Horminum occidentale is now considered endangered and is protected in several European countries.</p>
