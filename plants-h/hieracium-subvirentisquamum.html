<p>Hieracium subvirentisquamum, commonly known as the green-squamate hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>

The plant typically grows in moist, grassy habitats and has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. Its yellow flowers appear in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, elongated achenes for seed dispersal.</p>
