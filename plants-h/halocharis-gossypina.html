<p>Halocharis gossypina, commonly known as the woolly nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically purple or violet in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in a thick layer of fine hairs, which provide insulation against extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>Halocharis gossypina is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats.</p>
