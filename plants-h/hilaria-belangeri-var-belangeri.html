                    <h1>Hilaria belangeri var. belangeri</h1>
<p>Hilaria belangeri var. belangeri, commonly known as blue grama, is a perennial grass native to the central and southern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences that appear in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion.</p>
<p>Blue grama is often used in native plant gardens and restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and low maintenance requirements.</p>
