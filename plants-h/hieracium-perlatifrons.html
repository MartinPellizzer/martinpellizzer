<p>Hieracium perlatifrons, commonly known as the silverleaf hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the daisy family (Asteraceae).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, silver-green leaves and yellow disk flowers that bloom in summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant's hairy stems and leaves help reduce water loss, adapting it to drier environments.</p>
<p>It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively.</p>
