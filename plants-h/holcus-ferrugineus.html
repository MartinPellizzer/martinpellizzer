<p>Holcus ferrugineus, commonly known as red hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, wiry inflorescence that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a reddish tinge, and its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Holcus ferrugineus is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
