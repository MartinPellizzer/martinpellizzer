                    <h1>Hydnora gigantea</h1>
<p>Hydnora gigantea, commonly known as the giant hydnora, is a parasitic plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis, relying entirely on its host plant for nutrients. The plant produces a distinctive, fleshy, reddish-purple flower that emits a strong odor to attract pollinators. Its structure is simple, with no true leaves or stems, and it grows underground or within the host's tissue.</p>
<p>The flower opens at night, and its unique morphology makes it a fascinating subject in botanical studies.</p>
