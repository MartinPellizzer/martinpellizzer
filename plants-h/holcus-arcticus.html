<p>Holcus arcticus, commonly known as Arctic feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces delicate, feathery inflorescences that are often pink or purple in color, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons.</p>
<p>Holcus arcticus plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environments and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
