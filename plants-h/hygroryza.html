                    <h1>Hygroryza</h1>
<p>Hygroryza, commonly known as the water fern, is a genus of aquatic ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their delicate, feathery fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater environments. Hygroryza species are often found in slow-moving streams, ponds, and marshy areas, where they play a role in aquatic ecosystems. Their rhizomes help stabilize the substrate, and their fronds provide habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The genus is notable for its ability to tolerate varying water conditions and its use in traditional medicine in some regions.</p>
