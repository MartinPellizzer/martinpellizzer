<p>Hypoporum humile, commonly known as the common sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically features small, clustered leaves and produces tiny white or pink flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or alpine environments. Its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate harsh conditions make it an important component of pioneer vegetation.</p>
<p>Hypoporum humile plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations.</p>
