                    <h1>Helleborus niger var. stenopetalus</h1>
<p>Helleborus niger var. stenopetalus, commonly known as the narrow-petaled white hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark green, palmately lobed leaves and its striking, waxy white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The flowers have a distinctive narrow, elongated petal shape, which gives the plant its varietal name. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in shade and well-drained soil.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to the common hellebore, Helleborus niger, but differs in its floral morphology.</p>
