                    <h1>Hemionitis californica</h1>
<p>Hemionitis californica, commonly known as the California hemionitis, is a rare and delicate fern native to the coastal regions of California.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal bluffs and rock outcrops. The plant has feathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
