                    <h1>Hymenopappus filifolius var. nudipes</h1>
<p>Hymenopappus filifolius var. nudipes, commonly known as the naked-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It has small, scale-like leaves that are often obscured by its dense, woolly covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which consume the fleshy, red berries.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments by reducing water loss through its unique leaf structure.</p>
