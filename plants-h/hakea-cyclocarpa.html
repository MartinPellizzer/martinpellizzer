                    <h1>Hakea cyclocarpa</h1>
<p>Hakea cyclocarpa, commonly known as the globular hakea, is a shrub native to south-western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of small, waxy leaves that give it a unique appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are followed by distinctive, urn-shaped red fruits. Hakea cyclocarpa is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for cultivation in well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value has led to its use in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions.</p>
