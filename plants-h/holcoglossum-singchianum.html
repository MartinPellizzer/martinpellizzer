<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, elongated flowers that resemble a tongue, hence its genus name "Holcoglossum," meaning "tongue-like.".

Its botanical features include long, narrow leaves and a compact growth habit, making it a distinctive member of the orchid family.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
