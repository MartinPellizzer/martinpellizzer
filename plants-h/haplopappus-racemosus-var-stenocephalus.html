                    <h1>Haplopappus racemosus var. stenocephalus</h1>
<p>Haplopappus racemosus var. stenocephalus, commonly known as the narrow-headed goatweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, branching stems covered in fine, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are typically linear to lance-shaped, with a rough, textured surface that aids in reducing water evaporation.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its narrower capitula compared to other varieties within the species.</p>
