                    <h1>Hemisphaera kryophila</h1>
<p>Hemisphaera kryophila, commonly known as the snowbank lily, is a rare alpine plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive hemispherical-shaped flower that resembles a small bowl, hence its genus name. The plant thrives in cold, moist environments and is adapted to survive in harsh, snow-covered conditions. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, and it blooms in early summer when the snow begins to melt.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Hemisphaera kryophila is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
