                            <h1>Hieracium Insuetum Subsp. Castriferrei</h1>
<p>Common hawkweed, scientifically known as Hieracium insuetum subsp. castriferrei, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its dandelion-like appearance. This subspecies is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and open habitats, making it a common sight in meadows and along roadsides. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Despite its beauty, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions, posing a threat to native plant communities.</p>
