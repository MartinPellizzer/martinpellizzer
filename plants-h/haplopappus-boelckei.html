<p>Haplopappus boelckei, commonly known as the desert hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions through its deep root system. Its yellow flowers bloom in the spring, and the plant produces small, pappus-equipped seeds for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Haplopappus boelckei is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
