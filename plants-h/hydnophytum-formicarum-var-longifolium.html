<p>Hydnophytum formicarum var. longifolium, commonly known as the ant plant, is a climbing hemiparasitic plant that relies on ant symbiosis for nutrient acquisition.</p>
<p>It produces specialized structures called domatia, which provide shelter for colonies of ants. The plant's leaves are broad and elongated, with a distinctive waxy coating that aids in water retention. It is native to tropical regions of Asia and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Its unique relationship with ants makes it an important component of its ecological community.</p>
