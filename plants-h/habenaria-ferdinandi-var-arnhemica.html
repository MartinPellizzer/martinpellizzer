<p>Habenaria ferdinandi var. arnhemica, commonly known as the Arnhem Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of pale green to white flowers with intricate, spurred petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on the forest floor or along rocky outcrops. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, this species is considered threatened, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
