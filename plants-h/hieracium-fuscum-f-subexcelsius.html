<p>Hieracium fuscum f. subexcelsius, commonly known as the tall hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family, which attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a rough texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>This form is a variant of *Hieracium fuscum*, distinguished by its greater height and more elongated floral structures.</p>
