<p>Hermione unicolor var. tingitana, commonly known as the Canary Island cypress, is a rare and ornamental conifer native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, columnar form and dark green, scale-like foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green cones, typical of the Cupressaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a specimen plant.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range and susceptibility to environmental stress, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
