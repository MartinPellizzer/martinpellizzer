<p>Hirculus litangensis, commonly known as the Litang goat-antler plant, is a rare and unique species native to the high-altitude regions of Sichuan, China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, and often branched stems that resemble the antlers of a goat. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, and it has a short flowering period during the summer months. Hirculus litangensis is adapted to cold, arid environments and thrives in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 3,000 meters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
