                    <h1>Hakea longifolia</h1>
<p>Hakea longifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces striking cylindrical flower spikes that range in color from white to pink, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Hakea longifolia is adapted to low rainfall and well-drained soils, making it a resilient component of coastal and sandy ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in the region's flora.</p>
