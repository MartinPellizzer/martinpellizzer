                    <h1>Hymenachne serrulata</h1>
<p>Hymenachne serrulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hymenachne, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and floodplains, where it forms dense, rhizomatous stands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with serrated margins, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils and its role in stabilizing aquatic and riparian ecosystems.</p>
<p>Hymenachne serrulata is also valued for its potential in phytoremediation due to its tolerance of nutrient-rich and contaminated environments.</p>
