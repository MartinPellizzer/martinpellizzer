                    <h1>Homollea furtiva</h1>
<p>Homollea furtiva, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to survive.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its secretive nature, Homollea furtiva is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
