<p>Hemiphragma heterophyllum var. dentatum, commonly known as the serrated hemiphragma, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring serrated margins and a distinct, often hairy texture. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, adapting to low-nutrient soils and limited water availability. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a range of colors that attract specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.</p>
