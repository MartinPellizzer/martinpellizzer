<p>Hymenophyllum lophocarpum, commonly known as the slender shield fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, intricately veined fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a kidney-shaped indusium.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens.</p>
