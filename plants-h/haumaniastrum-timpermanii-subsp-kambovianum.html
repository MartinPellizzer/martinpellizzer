<p>Haumaniastrum timpermanii subsp.</p>
<p>kambovianum, commonly known as the Kambovian sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features small, fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
