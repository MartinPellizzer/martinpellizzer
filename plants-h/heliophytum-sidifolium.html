<p>Heliophytum sidifolium, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged foliage. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun exposure to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
