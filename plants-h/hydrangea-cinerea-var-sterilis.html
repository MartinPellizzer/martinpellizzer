                    <h1>Hydrangea cinerea var. sterilis</h1>
<p>Hydrangea cinerea var. sterilis, commonly known as the silverleaf hydrangea, is a rare and less commonly cultivated variant of the hydrangea genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and showy, cone-shaped flower clusters that bloom in late spring. This plant prefers partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, thriving in temperate climates. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, depending on soil pH, and it is noted for its compact growth habit.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in woodland areas and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists.</p>
