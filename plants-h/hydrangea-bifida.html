<p>Hydrangea bifida, commonly known as the cutleaf hydrangea, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that can range in color from white to pink and blue, depending on soil pH.

It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes.</p>
<p>Hydrangea bifida is also known for its ability to produce abundant fruit, which is edible but often considered ornamental rather than culinary.</p>
