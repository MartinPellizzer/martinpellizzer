                    <h1>Hieracium taraxaciforme</h1>
<p>Hieracium taraxaciforme, commonly known as the "dandelion-like hawkweed," is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a yellow flower head composed of numerous small florets. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and disturbed soils. It produces a distinctive seed head with pappus structures that aid in wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its similarity to dandelions, it can be easily confused with other members of the genus Hieracium.</p>
