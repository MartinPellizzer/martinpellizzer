                    <h1>Hordeum maritimum</h1>
<p>Hordeum maritimum, commonly known as sea barley, is a coastal grass species native to the shores of Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and sandy environments, often found along beaches and dunes where it helps stabilize dune formations. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear颖果 (glumes) enclosing the seeds. Its adaptation to harsh coastal conditions includes a deep root system and salt tolerance mechanisms.</p>
<p>Hordeum maritimum plays a vital ecological role in preventing erosion and supporting coastal biodiversity.</p>
