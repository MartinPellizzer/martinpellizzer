<p>bupleurifolium, commonly known as the bupleurifolium hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides, and it has a rosette of basal leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its leaves are lanceolate to ovate in shape, with a rough texture, and the flowers are yellow with prominent central disk florets.</p>
