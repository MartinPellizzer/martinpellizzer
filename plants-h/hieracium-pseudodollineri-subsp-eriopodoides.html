<p>Hieracium pseudodollineri subsp.</p>
<p>eriopodoides, commonly known as the woolly-haired hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rugged appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in mountain meadows and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
