                    <h1>Helianthemum tuberaria var. globulariifolia</h1>
<p>Helianthemum tuberaria var. globulariifolia, commonly known as the globular leaf sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The leaves are succulent, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps the plant conserve water in arid environments. It thrives in rocky soils and full sun, making it well adapted to coastal and limestone habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its globular, rounded leaf shape, which gives it its specific epithet.</p>
