<p>Habenaria binghamii, commonly known as the Bingham's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate floral structure and specialized pollination mechanisms. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth where it can receive adequate light without direct exposure. Its flowers are usually small and fragrant, with a unique coloration pattern that aids in attracting specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
