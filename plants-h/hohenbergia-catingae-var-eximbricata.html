                    <h1>Hohenbergia catingae var. eximbricata</h1>
<p>Hohenbergia catingae var. eximbricata, commonly known as the Catinga Hohenbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of narrow, dark green leaves that are often adorned with white or silver markings. The plant produces vibrant orange-red inflorescences that emerge from the center of the rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance in suitable growing conditions.</p>
