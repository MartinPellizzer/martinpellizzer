                    <h1>Hecatactis</h1>
<p>Hecatactis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, translucent greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Hecatactis is highly specialized, requiring specific humidity and light conditions to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
