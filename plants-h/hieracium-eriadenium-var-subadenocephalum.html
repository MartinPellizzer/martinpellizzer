                    <h1>Hieracium eriadenium var. subadenocephalum</h1>
<p>Hieracium eriadenium var. subadenocephalum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy, yellowish-green leaves and showy, dandelion-like flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
