<p>Hohenbergia correia-arauji, commonly known as the "Coral Hohenbergia," is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It features vibrant, coral-pink bracts that surround its compact, rosette-shaped leaves. The plant has a short, stout stem and produces small, white flowers that emerge from the leaf axils. Its leaves are broad, fleshy, and covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture.</p>
<p>This species is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low light requirements and ability to thrive in humid environments.</p>
