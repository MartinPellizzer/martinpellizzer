<p>Huperzia medogensis, commonly known as the Medog huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, linear leaves and a distinct sporophyte structure. Native to China, particularly in the Yunnan and Sichuan provinces, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant's spores are produced on the underside of its leaves, typical of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Huperzia medogensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
