                    <h1>Hedera helix var. tortuosa</h1>
<p>Hedera helix var. tortuosa, commonly known as the twisted ivy, is a variant of the common English ivy characterized by its uniquely twisted and curled leaves.</p>
<p>This cultivar exhibits a compact growth habit, making it suitable for hanging baskets or as a trailing plant in containers. The leaves are typically a deep green with a textured, almost waxy surface, and they display a dramatic, swirling pattern that sets it apart from other ivy varieties. It thrives in partial to full shade and is relatively low maintenance, requiring moderate watering and well-draining soil.</p>
<p>While it is primarily grown for its ornamental foliage, it can also be used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in shaded areas.</p>
