                    <h1>Hydrocotyle candollei</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle candollei, commonly known as the Mexican water shield, is a floating aquatic plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface, allowing it to float on water surfaces. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, enabling it to colonize wetlands and slow-moving water bodies.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle candollei plays a role in stabilizing water ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
