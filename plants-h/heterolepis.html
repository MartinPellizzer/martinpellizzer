<p>Heterolepis, commonly known as the jointed grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, including nodes and internodes that are often swollen or jointed. Species within this genus are typically found in wetland or marshy environments, where they thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib.</p>
<p>Heterolepis species are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
