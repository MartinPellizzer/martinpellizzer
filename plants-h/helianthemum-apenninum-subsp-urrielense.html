<p>Helianthemum apenninum subsp.</p>
<p>urrielense, commonly known as the Corsican rock rose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica and Sardinia. It is a low-growing shrub with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky or limestone soils and is often found in coastal areas and mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
