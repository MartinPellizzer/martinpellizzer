<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and bright yellow to golden-orange flowers that retain their color even when dried. The plant produces small, tubular florets surrounded by overlapping, papery bracts that give it a fluffy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often used in horticulture for both its aesthetic appeal and its ability to thrive in arid conditions.</p>
