<p>Heracleum acuminatum, commonly known as narrowleaf cowparley, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-shaped clusters called umbels. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care.</p>
