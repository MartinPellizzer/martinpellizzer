                    <h1>Hieracium arvetii var. subisaricum</h1>
<p>Hieracium arvetii var. subisaricum, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with hairy surfaces. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in grasslands, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats.</p>
