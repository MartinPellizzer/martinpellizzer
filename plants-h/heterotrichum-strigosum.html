<p>Heterotrichum strigosum, commonly known as the hairy feather moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and its hairy appearance due to the presence of specialized structures called rhizoids. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its leaves are elongated and gradually tapering, with a distinct midrib.</p>
<p>Heterotrichum strigosum plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its habitat.</p>
