<p>Haplopappus arenarius, commonly known as the sandblow or sandpuff, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in the spring, and it produces fluffy, white pappus structures that aid in wind dispersal of its seeds.</p>
<p>Haplopappus arenarius is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
