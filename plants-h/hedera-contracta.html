                    <h1>Hedera contracta</h1>
<p>Hedera contracta, commonly known as the dwarf English ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to western Europe.</p>
<p>It features dark green, glossy leaves that are typically smaller than those of other ivy species. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for ground cover or as a climbing plant.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions.</p>
