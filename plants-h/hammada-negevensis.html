<p>Hammada negevensis, commonly known as the Negev dwarf aloe, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the Negev Desert in Israel.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped growth habit and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The leaves are typically blue-green in color and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months, which are borne on tall, slender stems.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water once established.</p>
