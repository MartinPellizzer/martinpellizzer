<p>It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with five petals and a distinctive central structure.</p>
<p>Herniaria abyssinica is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in harsh, high-altitude conditions.</p>
