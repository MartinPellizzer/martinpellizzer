                            <h1>Helianthus Amplexicaulis</h1>
<p>Helianthus amplexicaulis, commonly known as the bear's breech, is a striking plant native to the eastern United States. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that hug the stem, giving it its distinctive name. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. While it thrives in woodland areas, it is also adaptable to garden settings with proper care. Its unique appearance and ecological benefits make it a valuable addition to both natural and cultivated landscapes.</p>
