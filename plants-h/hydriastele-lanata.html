                    <h1>Hydriastele lanata</h1>
<p>Hydriastele lanata, commonly known as the hairy hydriastele, is a species of flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy trichomes. These trichomes help in reducing water loss and provide some protection against herbivores.</p>
<p>Hydriastele lanata typically produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees.</p>
