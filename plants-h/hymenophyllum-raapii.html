<p>Hymenophyllum raapii, commonly known as the New Zealand fernlet, is a small, epiphytic fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows on tree trunks and rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of hair-like structures, which help retain moisture.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum raapii is notable for its unique reproductive structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of its fronds.</p>
