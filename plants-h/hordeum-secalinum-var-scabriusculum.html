                    <h1>Hordeum secalinum var. scabriusculum</h1>
<p>Hordeum secalinum var. scabriusculum, commonly known as rough barley, is a wild grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and rough, scabrous leaf surfaces that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and other open areas. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are usually loose and branched, with palea and lemma structures typical of the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>This variant is often considered a weed in agricultural settings but has ecological significance in supporting insect and bird populations.</p>
