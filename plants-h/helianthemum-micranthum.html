<p>Helianthemum micranthum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandthrift, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal and Mediterranean climates. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a bright touch to its compact foliage. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Helianthemum micranthum is valued in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to thrive in challenging environments.</p>
