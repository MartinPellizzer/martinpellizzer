                    <h1>Hypolepis melanochlaena</h1>
<p>Hypolepis melanochlaena, commonly known as the black-stemmed sword fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are often slightly curled at the tips. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself in soil or substrates.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid climates.</p>
