                    <h1>Hemionitis japonica</h1>
<p>Hemionitis japonica, commonly known as the Japanese hemionitis, is a rare and delicate fern native to Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and somewhat leathery in texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with cool, humid climates. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Hemionitis japonica is considered a rare and endangered plant.</p>
