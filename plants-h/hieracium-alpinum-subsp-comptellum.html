<p>Hieracium alpinum subsp.</p>
<p>comptellum, commonly known as Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellow flowers arranged in a composite head.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its fibrous root system helps it anchor in unstable terrain, and its hairy leaves reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in mountain meadows and is adapted to the extreme climatic conditions of its habitat.</p>
