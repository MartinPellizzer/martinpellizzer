                    <h1>Hemionitis wootonii</h1>
<p>Hemionitis wootonii, commonly known as the Wooton's hemionitis, is a rare and specialized fern native to specific regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in rocky or forested areas with high humidity. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Hemionitis wootonii is considered a conservation concern.</p>
