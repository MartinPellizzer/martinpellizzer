                    <h1>Himantoglossum hircinum var. heldreichii</h1>
<p>Himantoglossum hircinum var. heldreichii, commonly known as the Balkan spurred orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers with prominent spurred petals, which are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils in open habitats such as grasslands and forest edges. It is a perennial herb with a short, creeping rhizome and lanceolate leaves.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
