<p>Hieracium ramosissimum subsp.</p>
<p>viscosum, commonly known as the sticky hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, often sticky stems and leaves, which give it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist meadows and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from other Hieracium species, particularly in the structure and density of its pubescence.</p>
