                            <h1>Hypochaeris Palustris</h1>
<p>Hypochaeris palustris is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland areas of North America. It is commonly known as swamp ragwort or water ragwort and belongs to the Asteraceae family. This plant is often found in marshy soils and along the edges of ponds and streams. Its yellow flowers bloom in the summer and attract various pollinators. Despite its common presence, it is sometimes overlooked due to its modest appearance.</p>
