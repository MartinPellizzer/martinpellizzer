                    <h1>Heterozeuxine viridiflora</h1>
<p>Heterozeuxine viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees.</p>
<p>It lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are scale-like and often remain hidden among the host's foliage.</p>
<p>The species is found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in warm, humid environments.</p>
