                    <h1>Herniaria canariensis</h1>
<p>Herniaria canariensis, commonly known as Canary sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, coastal environments and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of tiny white flowers. The plant has a compact structure with a basal rosette and produces numerous stolons that help it spread across the ground. Its succulent leaves store water, allowing it to survive in arid and nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Herniaria canariensis is often found in maritime climates and is adapted to withstand strong winds and salt spray.</p>
