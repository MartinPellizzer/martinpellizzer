<p>Hieracium diaphanoides subsp.</p>
<p>atriplex, commonly known as the silver hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-green leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry meadows, grasslands, and rocky soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its subspecies status reflects subtle differences in morphology compared to other Hieracium species.</p>
<p>It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas.</p>
