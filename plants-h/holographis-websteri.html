                    <h1>Holographis websteri</h1>
<p>Holographis websteri, commonly known as the Webster's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is a terrestrial orchid with a slender, leafless stem that produces a single bloom. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands, often growing on the ground or on decaying wood.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Holographis websteri is considered endangered and is protected in many areas.</p>
