<p>Hoya nummularia, commonly known as the "Chinese Jade" or "Rosy Wreath," is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy, and often variegated leaves that can range from light green to pink and white. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late summer or early autumn.
