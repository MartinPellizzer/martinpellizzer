The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry landscapes.</p>
