                    <h1>Hypserpa mackeei</h1>
<p>Hypserpa mackeei, commonly known as the Mackee's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on decaying wood in humid, shaded environments, relying on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake. Its limited distribution and specialized habitat make it highly vulnerable to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity, it is protected in many areas and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
