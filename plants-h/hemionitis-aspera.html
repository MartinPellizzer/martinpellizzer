                    <h1>Hemionitis aspera</h1>
<p>Hemionitis aspera, commonly known as the rough hemionitis, is a rare and specialized aquatic plant native to the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, flattened, ribbon-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures. This plant thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats with strong currents, often found in mountain streams and rivers. Its reproductive structures are adapted for dispersal by water, with small, greenish flowers that appear in early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, Hemionitis aspera is considered an endangered species.</p>
