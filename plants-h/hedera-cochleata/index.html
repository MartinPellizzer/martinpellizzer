                            <h1>Hedera Cochleata</h1>
<p>Hedera cochleata is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is known for its striking, spiral-shaped leaves that resemble the shell of a snail. This evergreen vine thrives in cool, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its foliage is not only visually appealing but also holds cultural significance in local communities. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, Hedera cochleata is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
