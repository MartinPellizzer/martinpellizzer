                    <h1>Hieracium hypochoeroides var. saxorum</h1>
<p>Hieracium hypochoeroides var. saxorum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant features a low-growing rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in cold, windy conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its smaller, more compact growth compared to other Hieracium species.</p>
