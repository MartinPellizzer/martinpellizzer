                    <h1>Heliotropium arenicola</h1>
<p>Heliotropium arenicola, commonly known as the beach heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling those of the common heliotrope. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Heliotropium arenicola plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and supporting coastal biodiversity.</p>
