                    <h1>Helonias viridis</h1>
<p>Helonias viridis, commonly known as the green pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, tubular leaves that form deep, water-filled traps to lure and digest insects. The plant's unique morphology includes a specialized leaf structure with a lid that opens to allow prey to fall into the digestive chamber. Helonias viridis thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and requires consistently moist conditions to survive.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes controlling insect populations and contributing to wetland biodiversity.</p>
