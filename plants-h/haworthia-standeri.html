<p>Haworthia standeri, commonly known as the Zulu bulb, is a compact, evergreen succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves with white or pale blue markings, which help it store water and reflect sunlight. The plant produces small, white, tubular flowers on slender stems during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections.</p>
