<p>Homocolleticon monteiroae, commonly known as the Monteiro's leaf-miner moth, is a species of moth in the family Tenthredinidae.</p>
<p>It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil, where it inhabits tropical rainforests. The larvae of this species are leaf-miners, feeding on the tissues of specific plants, primarily species of the genus Myrtus. Its life cycle is closely tied to the seasonal changes in its habitat, with adults emerging during the wet season.</p>
<p>The plant's ecological significance lies in its role as a host for this unique insect, contributing to the biodiversity of the region.</p>
