                    <h1>Heracleum</h1>
<p>Heracleum, commonly known as cow parsley or giant hogweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their tall, branched stems and large, umbrella-like inflorescences composed of small white or greenish-yellow flowers. The leaves are typically large, deeply lobed, and have a distinct, often aromatic scent. Heracleum species are native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>Some species, like Heracleum mantegazzii, are considered invasive and can pose a risk due to their toxic sap.</p>
