<p>Hymenophyllum dependens, commonly known as the hanging holly fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often hang from tree branches. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its leaves, which are covered in a layer of tiny, scale-like structures called rhizoids.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum dependens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or terrariums.</p>
