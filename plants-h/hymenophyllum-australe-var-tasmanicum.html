<p>Hymenophyllum australe var. tasmanicum, commonly known as the Tasmanian filmy fern, is a small, delicate fern native to Tasmania.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thin, translucent fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in rock crevices or on tree trunks. Its spores are released from small, club-like structures called sporangia located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variety is part of the Hymenophyllaceae family, which includes other species of filmy ferns known for their unique morphology and ecological adaptations.</p>
