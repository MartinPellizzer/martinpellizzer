<p>Hypericum reflexum var. leiocladum, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan.</p>
<p>It features upright, somewhat woody stems that are smooth and slightly hairy, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually green and slightly glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers in late summer, which are followed by red, berry-like seed capsules. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or open woodland habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its smoother stems and more compact growth compared to other Hypericum species.</p>
