<p>Habenaria pilgeri, commonly known as the Pilger's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it thrives on decaying organic matter. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Habenaria pilgeri is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
