                    <h1>Hymenophyllum firmum</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum firmum, commonly known as the firm moss-fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, needle-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures called trichomes, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum firmum is primarily found in Southeast Asia, including regions of India, China, and the Pacific islands.</p>
