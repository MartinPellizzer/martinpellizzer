<p>Hermannia transvaalensis, commonly known as the Transvaal bladderwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has a unique habit of growing in wet, marshy environments, often in shaded areas near water bodies. Its leaves are usually submerged or floating, and it produces tiny, bladder-like structures that aid in trapping small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Hermannia transvaalensis is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens.</p>
