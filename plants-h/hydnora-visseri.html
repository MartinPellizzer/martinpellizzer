                    <h1>Hydnora visseri</h1>
<p>Hydnora visseri, commonly known as the Namibian hydnora, is a parasitic plant found primarily in the Namib Desert.</p>
<p>It lacks true leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host plant for nutrients. The plant produces a unique, fleshy, reddish structure that resembles a flower, though it does not perform photosynthesis. Its flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators like flies.</p>
<p>Hydnora visseri is notable for its extreme adaptation to arid environments and its specialized reproductive strategy.</p>
