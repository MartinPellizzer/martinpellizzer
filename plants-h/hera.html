                    <h1>Hera</h1>
<p>Hera, commonly known as the goddess of marriage and the sky in Greek mythology, is not a plant but a deity.</p>
<p>However, if referring to a plant named "Hera," it might be a misspelling or confusion with other botanical names. There is no widely recognized plant species named "Hera.". If you meant a different plant, please provide more context.</p>
<p>I can't reply.</p>
