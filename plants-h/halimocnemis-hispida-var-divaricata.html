<p>Halimocnemis hispida var. divaricata, commonly known as the rough-hairy halimocnemis, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is adapted to withstand drought conditions, with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. It often grows in rocky or sandy soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>The varietal form, divaricata, is distinguished by its more branched and spreading growth habit compared to the typical form.</p>
