                    <h1>Haplopappus stolonifer</h1>
<p>Haplopappus stolonifer, commonly known as the creeping pappus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features a mat-forming growth habit with spreading stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to colonize rocky or sandy soils effectively. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Haplopappus stolonifer is well adapted to harsh conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats.</p>
