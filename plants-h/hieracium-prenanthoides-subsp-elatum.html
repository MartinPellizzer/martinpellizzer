<p>Hieracium prenanthoides subsp.</p>
<p>elatum, commonly known as the tall mouse-ear hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowering heads that are typically arranged in a single stem, with ray florets that are shorter than the disk florets. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
