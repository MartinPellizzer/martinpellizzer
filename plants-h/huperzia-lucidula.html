<p>Huperzia lucidula, commonly known as the shining huperzia, is a species of fern-like plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, creeping growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often glossy and covered in fine hairs. Native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which release spores for reproduction.</p>
<p>Huperzia lucidula is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, low-growing mats.</p>
