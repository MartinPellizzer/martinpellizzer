                    <h1>Hesperocyparis revealiana</h1>
<p>Hesperocyparis revealiana, commonly known as the Revelian incense cedar, is a rare and endangered conifer native to the coastal regions of Oregon and California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and scale-like leaves that are blue-green in color. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and forest habitats.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered one of the most critically endangered conifers in North America.</p>
