                    <h1>Heterolaena itapingensis</h1>
<p>Heterolaena itapingensis, commonly known as the Itapinga grass, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland or riparian habitats, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the plant, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Heterolaena itapingensis is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and its potential for use in phytoremediation.</p>
