<p>Hemionitis incarum, commonly known as the mountain hemionitis, is a rare and distinctive plant belonging to the Pteridaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in rocky, alpine environments. The plant features delicate, pinnate leaves that are covered in a fine, whitish coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. It is native to regions in Asia, including parts of China and the Himalayas.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Hemionitis incarum is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
