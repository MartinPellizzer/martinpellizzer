                    <h1>Hymenophyllum cristulatum</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum cristulatum, commonly known as the cristate maidenhair fern, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, moss-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum cristulatum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in specialized gardens.</p>
