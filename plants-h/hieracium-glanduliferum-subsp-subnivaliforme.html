<p>Hieracium glanduliferum subsp.</p>
<p>subnivaliforme, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. It has a hairy stem and leaves with glandular surfaces, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in the alpine zones of the Alps and Carpathian Mountains.</p>
