<p>verticillatum, commonly known as the clustered cowparsnip, is a member of the Apiaceae family characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, umbrella-like inflorescences. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into fluffy, white seeds. It is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in wetlands, where it can form dense stands.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it is considered a potentially harmful plant to handle without protective gear.</p>
