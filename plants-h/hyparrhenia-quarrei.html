                    <h1>Hyparrhenia quarrei</h1>
<p>Hyparrhenia quarrei, commonly known as the African grass or dwarf panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands, savannas, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to dry conditions and can thrive in poor soils, making it a resilient species in arid environments.</p>
<p>Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, contributing to its ecological importance in certain ecosystems.</p>
