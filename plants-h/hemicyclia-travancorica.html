                    <h1>Hemicyclia travancorica</h1>
<p>Hemicyclia travancorica, commonly known as the Travancore cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that are dark green and leathery. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native region.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
