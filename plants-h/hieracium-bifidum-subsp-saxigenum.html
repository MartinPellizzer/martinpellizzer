<p>Hieracium bifidum subsp.</p>
<p>saxigenum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in alpine and subalpine environments.</p>
<p>The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are broadly ovate to lanceolate in shape. Its yellow flowers are arranged in a single, terminal head, with ray florets that are usually shorter than the disk florets.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh, high-altitude habitat.</p>
