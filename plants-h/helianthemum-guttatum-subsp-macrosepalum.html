<p>Helianthemum guttatum subsp.</p>
<p>macrosepalum, commonly known as the large-sepal sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry scrublands.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscaped landscapes.</p>
