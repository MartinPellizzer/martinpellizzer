                    <h1>Heteroloma</h1>
<p>Heteroloma, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Aizoaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that often appear in clusters, with petals that resemble ghostly shapes, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, exhibiting adaptations to survive in harsh, dry environments. Heteroloma species are often found in rocky soils and have a low-growing, succulent appearance.</p>
<p>Their botanical significance lies in their specialized morphology and ecological role in desert ecosystems.</p>
