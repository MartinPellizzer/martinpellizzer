                    <h1>Hoya recurvula</h1>
<p>Hoya recurvula, commonly known as the curling wisteria, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing stems and clusters of small, waxy, wisteria-like flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slight waxy coating, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Hoya recurvula is popular among indoor gardeners for its elegant appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
