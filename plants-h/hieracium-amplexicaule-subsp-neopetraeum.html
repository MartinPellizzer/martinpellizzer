<p>Hieracium amplexicaule subsp.</p>
<p>neopetraeum, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually hairy and have a waxy coating.</p>
<p>The plant produces a single, tall flowering stem topped with a yellow composite flower head, which consists of many small florets. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
