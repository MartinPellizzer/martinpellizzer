<p>Hedypnois arenicola, commonly known as the sand lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in arid and coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a thin, tightly adherent layer on rock surfaces. The thallus is typically pale yellow to orange in color, and it lacks distinct lobes or rhizines. It is often found in sandy soils and on sun-exposed rock faces, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental conditions.</p>
