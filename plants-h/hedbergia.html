                    <h1>Hedbergia</h1>
<p>Hedbergia, commonly known as the "rock fig" or "stone apple," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa. The plants are characterized by their simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers that are often white or yellow in color. Hedbergia species typically grow in rocky or coastal environments, adapting to poor soil conditions and high salinity.</p>
<p>Their fruits are fleshy and edible, though some species are used in traditional medicine.</p>
