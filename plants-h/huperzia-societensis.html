<p>Huperzia societensis, commonly known as the Socotra dragon's blood fern, is a unique and ancient fern species native to the island of Socotra.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, and often reddish-brown fronds that resemble the appearance of dragon's blood. The plant belongs to the family Huperziaceae and is notable for its primitive morphology, which includes a lack of true roots and a specialized rhizome system. Huperzia societensis thrives in arid and rocky environments, showcasing its remarkable adaptability to harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Its conservation status is of concern due to habitat degradation and limited distribution.</p>
