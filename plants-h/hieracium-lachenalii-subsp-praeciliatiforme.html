<p>Hieracium lachenalii subsp.</p>
<p>praeciliatiforme, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellowish flowers arranged in a composite head.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat. It thrives in rocky or grassy slopes where the climate is cool and the soil is well-drained.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in mountainous areas of the Alps and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its environment.</p>
