                    <h1>Haplopappus arenarius var. incisifolius</h1>
<p>Haplopappus arenarius var. incisifolius, commonly known as the sand dune hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with narrow, linear leaves that are often sharply toothed or lobed. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes, it is an important species in desert ecosystems.</p>
