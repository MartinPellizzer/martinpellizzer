                    <h1>Hordeum lanuginosum</h1>
<p>Hordeum lanuginosum, commonly known as silky barley, is a species of grass native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into hard, three-angled grains.</p>
<p>Silky barley is not widely cultivated for food but is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
