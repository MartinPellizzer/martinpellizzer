<p>Hymenopappus pauciflorus, commonly known as the sparseflowered thistle, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to drought conditions with its hairy, waxy leaves. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, and the plant produces bristly, pappus-equipped seeds for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Hymenopappus pauciflorus is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of these environments.</p>
