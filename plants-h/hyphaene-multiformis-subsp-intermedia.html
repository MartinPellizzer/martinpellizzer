<p>Hyphaene multiformis subsp.</p>
<p>intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate double-bark palm, is a species native to the coastal areas of East Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive double-bark structure, which forms a thick, protective layer around the trunk.</p>
<p>The plant has pinnately compound leaves that are often used in traditional thatching and basket-making. Its fruits are small, three-angled drupes that contain a single seed.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it well-suited for coastal environments.</p>
