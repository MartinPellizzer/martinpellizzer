<p>Hebe subulata, commonly known as the silver hebe, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Hebe subulata is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract native pollinators.</p>
