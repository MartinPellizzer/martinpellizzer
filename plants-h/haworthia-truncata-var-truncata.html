                    <h1>Haworthia truncata var. truncata</h1>
<p>Haworthia truncata var. truncata, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves with distinctive white to yellowish markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The leaves are typically blue-green in color and have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. It produces small, star-shaped white flowers on tall stems during the summer months.</p>
<p>This species is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact size and ornamental appearance.</p>
