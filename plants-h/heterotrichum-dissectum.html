                    <h1>Heterotrichum dissectum</h1>
<p>Heterotrichum dissectum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, moss-like appearance and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant has a thallus that is usually divided into leaf-like structures called phyllidia, which are often narrow and dissected. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its growth is slow, making it a common indicator of undisturbed, humid habitats.</p>
<p>Heterotrichum dissectum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates.</p>
