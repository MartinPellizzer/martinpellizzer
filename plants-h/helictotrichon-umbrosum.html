<p>Helictotrichon umbrosum, commonly known as the shadow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage that thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with white or pale blue flowers in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, which helps reduce water loss in its preferred habitat.</p>
<p>Helictotrichon umbrosum is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
