<p>Haworthia arachnoidea var. pehlemanniae, commonly known as the spider haworthia, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves covered in a fine, white powdery coating called farina, which helps reduce water loss. The leaves are often adorned with translucent, spider-like markings, giving it its common name. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers on slender stems during the cooler months.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its unique appearance and ease of care, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
