                    <h1>Hydrocotyle boliviana</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle boliviana, commonly known as the Bolivian water shield, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant features floating leaves that are broadly heart-shaped with a waxy surface, and it produces small, white flowers during the summer months. Its roots help stabilize sediment, contributing to water clarity and ecosystem health.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle boliviana is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits.</p>
