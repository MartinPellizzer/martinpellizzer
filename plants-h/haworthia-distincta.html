                    <h1>Haworthia distincta</h1>
<p>Haworthia distincta, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, leafy succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dark green, fleshy leaves with white or light-colored markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant produces tall, slender flower stalks with small, star-shaped white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
