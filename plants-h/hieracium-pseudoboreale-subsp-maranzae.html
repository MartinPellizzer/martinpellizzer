<p>Hieracium pseudoboreale subsp.</p>
<p>maranzae, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions.</p>
<p>The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in mountainous areas of the Alps and Carpathians, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
