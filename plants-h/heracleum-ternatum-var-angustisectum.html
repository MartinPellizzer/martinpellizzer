<p>Heracleum ternatum var. angustisectum, commonly known as narrow-leaf hogweed, is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems that are often reddish-purple in color and covered with fine hairs. The plant produces large, umbrella-like inflorescences composed of small, white to greenish-yellow flowers. Its leaves are deeply lobed, with narrow, elongated segments that give it its specific epithet.</p>
<p>It is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
