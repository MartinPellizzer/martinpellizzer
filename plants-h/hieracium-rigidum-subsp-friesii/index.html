                            <h1>Hieracium Rigidum Subsp. Friesii</h1>
<p>Hieracium rigidum subsp. friesii is a lesser-known member of the dandelion family known for its distinctive appearance and ecological significance. This subspecies is characterized by its stiff, upright stems and hairy leaves that give it a rugged look. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, making it a common sight in meadows and along roadsides. Despite its modest size, it plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining biodiversity. Its resilience and adaptability make it a fascinating subject for both botanists and nature enthusiasts.</p>
