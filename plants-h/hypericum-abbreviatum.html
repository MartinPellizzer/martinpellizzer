                    <h1>Hypericum abbreviatum</h1>
<p>Hypericum abbreviatum, commonly known as the short-stemmed St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has woody stems that become more pronounced with age, and its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Despite its medicinal relatives, H. abbreviatum is not widely used in herbal medicine due to its limited availability and lesser-known properties.</p>
