                    <h1>Heteropogon triticeus</h1>
<p>Heteropogon triticeus, commonly known as the slender false oat, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>Heteropogon triticeus is often found in disturbed soils and can play a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
