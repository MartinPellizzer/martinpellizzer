                    <h1>Heliotropium bridgesii</h1>
<p>Heliotropium bridgesii, commonly known as the desert heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and can tolerate high temperatures and limited water availability.</p>
<p>Its flowers open in response to sunlight, a trait known as heliotropism, which aids in pollination.</p>
