                    <h1>Hesperocyparis arizonica var. nevadensis</h1>
<p>Hesperocyparis arizonica var. nevadensis, commonly known as the Arizona white fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the high elevations of the Great Basin and parts of the Sierra Nevada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and its silvery-blue foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The tree has scale-like leaves that are tightly packed, and it produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds. It thrives in cold, dry climates and is often found in rocky or well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
