<p>Hevea ternata, commonly known as the rubber vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its climbing habit and produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its latex sap, while not as commercially valuable as that of Hevea brasiliensis, has been used in traditional applications.</p>
<p>Hevea ternata plays a role in local ecosystems and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
