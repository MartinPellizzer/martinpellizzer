                    <h1>Hedysarum alpinum var. americanum</h1>
<p>Hedysarum alpinum var. americanum, commonly known as the American alpine vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats on rocky or gravelly slopes. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in early summer. Its trifoliate leaves are compound, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its erosion control capabilities and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
