                    <h1>Hoya columna</h1>
<p>Hoya columna, commonly known as the columnar hoya, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems that can grow quite long, often forming a column-like structure. The plant produces clusters of waxy, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, which bloom in response to bright light and consistent temperatures. Its leaves are typically thick and leathery, with a smooth texture and a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Hoya columna is well-suited for hanging baskets or trained on trellises due to its vine-like growth habit.</p>
