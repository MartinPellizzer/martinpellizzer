<p>Habenaria, commonly known as the butterfly orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their delicate, butterfly-like flowers that often feature intricate patterns and vibrant colors. Habenaria species are typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and wetlands, across temperate to tropical regions. They have pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, and their roots are often adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil.</p>
<p>The genus includes over 150 species, many of which are prized for their ornamental value in horticulture.</p>
