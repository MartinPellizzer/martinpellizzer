<p>Hordeum desmoulinsii, commonly known as desert barley, is a species of grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, sturdy stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Hordeum desmoulinsii is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
