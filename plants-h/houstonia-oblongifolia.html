                    <h1>Houstonia oblongifolia</h1>
<p>Houstonia oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf blue-eyed grass, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, though it is often mistaken for a flowering plant due to its showy blue flowers. The plant features slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches long. Its flowers, which bloom in early spring, are clustered in dense inflorescences and are characterized by their striking blue or purple color.</p>
<p>Houstonia oblongifolia thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland habitats.</p>
