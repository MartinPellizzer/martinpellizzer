<p>Heliconia bicolor, commonly known as the red-veined heliconia, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and Central America.</p>

The plant produces long, pendulous inflorescences with numerous small, yellowish-white flowers clustered around a central axis. Its leaves are large, broad, and often have a waxy texture, which helps it thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
