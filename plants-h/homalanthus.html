                    <h1>Homalanthus</h1>
<p>Homalanthus, commonly known as the "screw vine," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. They are characterized by their helically coiled stems, which give them their common name, and their small, inconspicuous flowers. The leaves are typically alternate and can be simple or lobed, depending on the species.</p>
<p>Homalanthus species often grow as vines or shrubs and are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value or used in traditional medicine.</p>
