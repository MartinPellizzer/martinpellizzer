<p>Hakea decurrens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking spikes of bright red or orange flowers, which appear in spring and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Hakea decurrens is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitat.</p>
