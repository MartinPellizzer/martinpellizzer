<p>Habenaria culmiformis, commonly known as the swamp orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom during the wet season. Its roots are often clustered and adapted to absorb nutrients from the waterlogged soil.</p>
<p>Habenaria culmiformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
