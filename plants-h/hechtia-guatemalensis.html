<p>Hechtia guatemalensis, commonly known as the Guatemalan hechtia, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage, which forms a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with brightly colored bracts that attract pollinators. Its leaves are typically thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native arid or semi-arid habitats.</p>
<p>Hechtia guatemalensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-draining soil with bright, indirect light.</p>
