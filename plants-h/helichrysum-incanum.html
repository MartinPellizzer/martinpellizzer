                    <h1>Helichrysum incanum</h1>
<p>Helichrysum incanum, commonly known as the silverleaf everlasting, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid climates. Its fibrous roots help prevent soil erosion, and it is often used in xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The plant's name comes from the Greek words "helios" meaning sun and "chrysis" meaning gold, referring to its sunny habitat and golden flowers.</p>
