                    <h1>Helianthemum ocymoides var. lasiocladum</h1>
<p>Helianthemum ocymoides var. lasiocladum, commonly known as the woolly rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a bright contrast to its dense, silver-gray foliage. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators.</p>
