<p>Hydrocotyle hirsuta var. minuta, commonly known as the small hairy water shield, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of heart-shaped, hairy leaves that float on the water surface, with a short, rhizomatous stem. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and provide some protection against herbivores.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
