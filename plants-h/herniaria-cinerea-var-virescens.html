                    <h1>Herniaria cinerea var. virescens</h1>
<p>Herniaria cinerea var. virescens, commonly known as green sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, greenish-blue leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its salty, windy habitat. The plant produces tiny white or pale pink flowers during the summer months, typically in clusters at the base of the stems. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of salt marshes.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and adaptation to harsh coastal environments make it an important component of maritime ecosystems.</p>
