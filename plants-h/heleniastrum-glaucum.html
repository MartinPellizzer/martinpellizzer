                    <h1>Heleniastrum glaucum</h1>
<p>Heleniastrum glaucum, commonly known as the blueweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows as a low, spreading shrub with gray-green, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its small, blue to purple flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Heleniastrum glaucum is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a resilient plant in desert ecosystems.</p>
