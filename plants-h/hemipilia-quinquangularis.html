<p>Hemipilia quinquangularis, commonly known as the five-angled hemipilia, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pale greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a unique floral structure with five distinct sepals and petals, giving it its common name. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemipilia quinquangularis is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
