<p>Herniaria hemistemon var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland dunes.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its glabrous (smooth) appearance, particularly on the stems and leaves, giving it its common name.</p>
