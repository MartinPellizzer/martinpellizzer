                    <h1>Hieracium saxatile var. stupposum</h1>
<p>Hieracium saxatile var. stupposum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. The plant features a basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. Its leaves are often covered in fine white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its more compact growth form and slightly different leaf morphology compared to other Hieracium species.</p>
