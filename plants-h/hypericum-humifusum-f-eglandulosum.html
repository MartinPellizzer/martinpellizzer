                    <h1>Hypericum humifusum f. eglandulosum</h1>
<p>Hypericum humifusum f. eglandulosum, commonly known as the glandless St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to North America.</p>
<p>It features small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in clusters along the stems. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often avoided by humans. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or open fields.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its lack of glandular dots on the leaves, which sets it apart from other forms of Hypericum.</p>
