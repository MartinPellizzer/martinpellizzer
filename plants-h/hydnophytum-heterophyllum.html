                    <h1>Hydnophytum heterophyllum</h1>
<p>Hydnophytum heterophyllum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It lacks true leaves and instead relies on its modified stems for photosynthesis, which are often covered in a dense, spongy layer that absorbs moisture from the air. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, making it a striking yet elusive species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
