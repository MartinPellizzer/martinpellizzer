<p>Hyparrhenia macrarrhena, commonly known as hairy flat sedge, is a perennial grass species native to Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, clumping growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and riverbanks, and is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Hyparrhenia macrarrhena is also valued for its ornamental appeal and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
