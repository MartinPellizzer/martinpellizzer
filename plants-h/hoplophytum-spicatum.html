<p>Hoplophytum spicatum, commonly known as the spiky euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by spiny, capsule-like fruits. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Hoplophytum spicatum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in dry environments.</p>
