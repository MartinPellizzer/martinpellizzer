<p>Hieracium bourgaei subsp.</p>
<p>sclerophyllum, commonly known as the hard-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, rigid leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive, rough texture.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a single head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as slopes and grasslands.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is relatively drought-tolerant and can withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>
