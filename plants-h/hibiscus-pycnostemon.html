                    <h1>Hibiscus pycnostemon</h1>
<p>Hibiscus pycnostemon, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom throughout the summer months. Hibiscus pycnostemon is a perennial shrub that thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to desert conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary response to drought and high temperatures.</p>
