                    <h1>Hydrocotyle umbellata var. intermedia</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle umbellata var. intermedia, commonly known as the spreading water shield, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features broad, rounded leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water surface. The plant produces small, white, umbellate flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and insects. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth makes it both a valuable aquatic plant and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats.</p>
