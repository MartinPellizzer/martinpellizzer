                    <h1>Helophytum natans</h1>
<p>Helophytum natans, commonly known as the floating stonecrop, is a unique aquatic plant that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, succulent-like rosettes of fleshy, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white, typically blooming in the summer months. Its roots are adapted to anchor it in shallow water, while its floating leaves allow it to access sunlight.</p>
<p>Helophytum natans plays a role in stabilizing water bodies and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
