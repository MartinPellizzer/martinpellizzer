<p>Habenaria psycodes f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered marsh orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant typically grows in wetlands and marshy areas, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and the inflorescence consists of a single raceme of small, fragrant flowers.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
