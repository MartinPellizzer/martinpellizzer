<p>Hieracium pilosella subsp.</p>
<p>velutinoides, commonly known as the velvet hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it can form dense colonies. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered with fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety appearance.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often confused with other hawkweed species due to its similar morphology but can be distinguished by its specific leaf and flower structures.</p>
