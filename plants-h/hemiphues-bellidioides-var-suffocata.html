                    <h1>Hemiphues bellidioides var. suffocata</h1>
<p>Hemiphues bellidioides var. suffocata, commonly known as the suffocating hemiphues, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody growth habit and small, often clustered leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in umbels, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its unique morphology allows it to thrive in harsh, dry environments with limited soil nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
