<p>Haworthia mucronata var. habdomadis, commonly known as the Moonlight Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves with translucent windows that allow light to penetrate to the chlorophyll layers beneath. The plant produces tall, slender inflorescences with small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring or summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to maintain its vibrant coloration.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts and indoor gardens.</p>
