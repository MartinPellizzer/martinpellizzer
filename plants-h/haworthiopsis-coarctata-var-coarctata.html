                    <h1>Haworthiopsis coarctata var. coarctata</h1>
<p>Haworthiopsis coarctata var. coarctata, commonly known as the Narrow-leaved Haworthia, is a compact, evergreen succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of narrow, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color with white markings. The plant produces small, white flowers on tall, slender stems during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its low maintenance and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
