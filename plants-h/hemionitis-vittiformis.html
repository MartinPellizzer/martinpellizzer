                    <h1>Hemionitis vittiformis</h1>
<p>Hemionitis vittiformis, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, undulating fronds that give it a zigzag appearance, which is an adaptation to its high-altitude environment. The plant belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is known for its delicate, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of moisture. It thrives in shaded, humid conditions and is typically found growing on rocky surfaces or in crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Hemionitis vittiformis is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
