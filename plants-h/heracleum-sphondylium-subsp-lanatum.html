<p>Heracleum sphondylium subsp.</p>
<p>lanatum, commonly known as the hairy hogweed, is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in umbrella-like inflorescences, which are typical of theApiaceae family. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap, it is considered a potentially dangerous plant that should be handled with care.</p>
