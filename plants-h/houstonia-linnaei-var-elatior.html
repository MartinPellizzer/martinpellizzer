<p>Houstonia linnaei var. elatior, commonly known as the showy blue-eyed grass, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features delicate, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. It is a member of the Poaceae family, though it resembles the genus Houstonia more than true grasses.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.</p>
