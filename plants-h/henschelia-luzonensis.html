                    <h1>Henschelia luzonensis</h1>
<p>Henschelia luzonensis, commonly known as the Luzon star orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the mountainous regions of Luzon, Philippines.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking star-shaped flowers, which are typically pale green with intricate patterns of darker green and yellow. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the dense rainforests, where it relies on humid conditions and filtered sunlight. Its floral structure is adapted for specific pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance in the region.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Henschelia luzonensis is considered critically endangered.</p>
