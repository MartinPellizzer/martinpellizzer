<p>Hypolepis minima, commonly known as the small shield fern, is a compact evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are densely packed around a short, unbranched stem. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a thin indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Hypolepis minima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in shaded gardens.</p>
