                    <h1>Heteroneuron serratifolium</h1>
<p>Heteroneuron serratifolium, commonly known as the serrated leaf heteroneuron, is a rare flowering plant native to the temperate rainforests of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its palmate leaves with finely serrated margins and clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in dense forest understories. Its botanical features make it an important species for studying plant adaptation to humid, low-light conditions.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas.</p>
