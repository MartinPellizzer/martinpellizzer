<p>Hieracium maculatum subsp.</p>
<p>maculatum, commonly known as the spotted hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves and stems are covered in fine hairs, which give it a distinctive, woolly appearance.</p>
<p>The subspecies is notable for its ability to spread rapidly through rhizomes, making it an invasive species in some regions.</p>
