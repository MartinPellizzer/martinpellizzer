<p>Hieracium glaucum subsp.</p>
<p>turbinatum, commonly known as the Turban Hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to central and eastern Europe. It typically grows in dry meadows, grasslands, and open woodlands, preferring well-drained soils.</p>
<p>The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are hairy and have a bluish-gray hue, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowering stems bear yellow composite flowers, consisting of many small florets arranged in a disk-like structure.</p>
<p>This subspecies is characterized by its distinctive turban-shaped flower heads, which give it its common name.</p>
