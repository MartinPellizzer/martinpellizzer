<p>Hormathophylla lapeyrouseana var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lichen, is a foliose lichen characterized by its leaf-like thallus structure.</p>
<p>It typically grows on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments, forming dense, cushion-like mats. The thallus is usually light to dark green, with a smooth or slightly wrinkled upper surface. It lacks distinct rhizines and has a relatively simple internal structure compared to other lichen species.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in regions with low humidity and high sunlight exposure.</p>
