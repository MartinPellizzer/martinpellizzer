<p>Hornemannia pinnata, commonly known as the white sand orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and clusters of white or pale green flowers with a distinctive, narrow, lance-shaped structure. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as pine flatwoods and sandhill areas. It produces small, fleshy roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
<p>The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral morphology and ecological niche.</p>
