                    <h1>Hoya flagellata</h1>
<p>Hoya flagellata, commonly known as the weeping hoya, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trailing stems and clusters of waxy, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The leaves are thick, glossy, and often have a waxy coating, which helps the plant retain moisture. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>This plant is popular among indoor gardeners for its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
