<p>Heliconia densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered heliconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the ginger family, Zingiberaceae, and is characterized by its large, colorful bracts that resemble petals. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers enclosed within the bracts, which serve as a nectar source for pollinators like hummingbirds and bats. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in humid environments.</p>
<p>Heliconia densiflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as part of tropical landscapes.</p>
