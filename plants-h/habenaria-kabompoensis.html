<p>Habenaria kabompoensis, commonly known as the Kabompo orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it thrives in nutrient-rich, well-drained soils. Its rhizomes are fibrous, and it produces small, oval-shaped pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
