                            <h1>Hypericum Nitidum Subsp. Exile</h1>
<p>Hypericum nitidum subsp. exile is a lesser-known member of the Hypericaceae family, often overshadowed by its more popular relatives like St. John's wort. This subshrub is native to southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. Its small, bright yellow flowers appear in clusters, adding a subtle yet striking visual appeal to its habitat. The plant is notable for its compact growth habit and ability to withstand harsh conditions. Despite its modest appearance, it holds ecological significance and is a subject of growing interest among botanists and horticulturists.</p>
