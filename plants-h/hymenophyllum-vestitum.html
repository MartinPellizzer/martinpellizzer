                    <h1>Hymenophyllum vestitum</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum vestitum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a small epiphytic fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, velvety moss-like fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum vestitum plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by contributing to forest biodiversity and soil stability.</p>
