                    <h1>Hemionitis eatonii</h1>
<p>Hemionitis eatonii, commonly known as the mountain holly or rock holly, is a rare and unique fern native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, and often hairy leaves that are spirally arranged along its creeping rhizomes. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the leaves, typical of ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemionitis eatonii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
