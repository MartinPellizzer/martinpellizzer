                <h1>Hemionitis pellaea</h1>
<p>Hemionitis pellaea, commonly known as the rock spikerush, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in rocky soils and is well adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Hemionitis pellaea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment.</p>
