                    <h1>Heteranthera formosa</h1>
<p>Heteranthera formosa, commonly known as the pink-flowered water hyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It features whorled leaves that are typically bright green with a waxy coating, allowing it to float on water surfaces. The plant produces small, clustered pink or purple flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. Its roots are submerged, absorbing nutrients from the water, which can lead to rapid growth in nutrient-rich environments.</p>
<p>Heteranthera formosa is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes.</p>
