                    <h1>Heracleum moellendorffii f. angustum</h1>
<p>Heracleum moellendorffii f. angustum, commonly known as narrowleaf cow parsnip, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically less than 1 meter in height. The plant produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as stream banks and meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its resemblance to poison hemlock, it requires careful identification to avoid confusion with toxic species.</p>
