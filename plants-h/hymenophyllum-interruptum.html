<p>Hymenophyllum interruptum, commonly known as the interrupted fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its spores are released from tiny, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum interruptum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in greenhouses or terrariums.</p>
