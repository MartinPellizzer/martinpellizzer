                    <h1>Hedysarum volitans</h1>
<p>Hedysarum volitans, commonly known as the wandering cranesbill, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its slender, creeping stems allow it to spread across rocky surfaces, and it produces small, bean-like pods that contain the seeds.</p>
<p>Hedysarum volitans is valued for its ornamental beauty and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh, arid conditions.</p>
