                    <h1>Heliotropium greuteri</h1>
<p>Heliotropium greuteri, commonly known as the desert heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with woody stems and small, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to purple, often resembling those of the common heliotrope. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Heliotropium greuteri is also known for its medicinal properties, with some traditional uses in indigenous cultures.</p>
