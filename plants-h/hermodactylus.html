                    <h1>Hermodactylus</h1>
<p>Hermodactylus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, showy white flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees in wetlands or swamps. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and decline in suitable environments, Hermodactylus is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
