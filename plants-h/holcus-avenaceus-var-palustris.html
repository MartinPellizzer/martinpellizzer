                    <h1>Holcus avenaceus var. palustris</h1>
<p>Holcus avenaceus var. palustris, commonly known as marsh bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist to waterlogged soils, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments and provides habitat for various invertebrates.</p>
<p>Due to its preference for wet conditions, it is often used in ecological restoration projects involving wetland rehabilitation.</p>
