<p>Hemionitis semicostata, commonly known as the kidney fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are deeply divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients.</p>
<p>Hemionitis semicostata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, fern-like appearance.</p>
