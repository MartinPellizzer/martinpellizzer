                    <h1>Hydrocotyle densiflora</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered water arum, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are often surrounded by a spatulate leaf-like structure. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread across wetland areas, forming dense mats.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle densiflora is adapted to aquatic environments, with specialized structures that help it thrive in shallow water and marshy habitats.</p>
