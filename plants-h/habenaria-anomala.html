                    <h1>Habenaria anomala</h1>
<p>Habenaria anomala, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unusual orchid species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent leaves and its striking, white, fragrant flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. This epiphytic plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. It has a unique root system that allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
