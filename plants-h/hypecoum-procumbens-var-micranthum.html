                    <h1>Hypecoum procumbens var. micranthum</h1>
<p>Hypecoum procumbens var. micranthum, commonly known as the creeping hellebore, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features basal leaves that are lanceolate and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions.</p>
