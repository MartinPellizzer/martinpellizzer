                    <h1>Helianthemum bramwelliorum</h1>
<p>Helianthemum bramwelliorum, commonly known as Bramwell's sandthrift, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens.</p>
