                    <h1>Hymenocoleus nervopilosus var. orientalis</h1>
<p>Hymenocoleus nervopilosus var. orientalis, commonly known as the oriental hair-veined fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely veined fronds that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the propagation of the species.</p>
<p>The leaves are bioluminescent, a unique feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
