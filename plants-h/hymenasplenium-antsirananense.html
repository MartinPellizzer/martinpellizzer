                    <h1>Hymenasplenium antsirananense</h1>
<p>Hymenasplenium antsirananense, commonly known as the Madagascar spleenwort, is a rare and endemic fern species found primarily in the humid forests of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of its fern group.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
