                    <h1>Hevea sieberi</h1>
<p>Hevea sieberi, commonly known as the wild rubber tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant is notable for its latex-producing properties, which are similar to those of the more commercially important Hevea brasiliensis. It typically grows in lowland rainforests and requires a warm, humid climate to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological significance and potential for latex production, it is sometimes cultivated in agroforestry systems.</p>
