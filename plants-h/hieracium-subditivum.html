                    <h1>Hieracium subditivum</h1>
<p>Hieracium subditivum, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, ditches, and along roadsides. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly lance-shaped with hairy surfaces, and it produces small, yellow flowers in clusters. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread easily and form dense mats.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings.</p>
