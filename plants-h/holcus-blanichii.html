<p>Holcus blanichii, commonly known as the blanichii hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves that are often covered in a powdery bloom. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.</p>
