                    <h1>Hypobathrum coriaceum</h1>
<p>Hypobathrum coriaceum, commonly known as the rough leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is adapted to store water, allowing it to survive prolonged dry periods.</p>
<p>Hypobathrum coriaceum is well-suited to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland dune environments.</p>
