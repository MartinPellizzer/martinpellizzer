                    <h1>Hypericum myricariifolium</h1>
<p>Hypericum myricariifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. Its medicinal properties have been historically used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that like other species in the Hypericum genus, it contains phototoxic compounds that can cause skin reactions upon sun exposure.</p>
