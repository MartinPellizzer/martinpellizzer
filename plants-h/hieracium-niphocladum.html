                    <h1>Hieracium niphocladum</h1>
<p>Hieracium niphocladum, commonly known as the snow-dusted hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy leaves and stems, which help reduce water loss in cold, harsh environments. It thrives in nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures.</p>
<p>Hieracium niphocladum plays a role in stabilizing alpine soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
