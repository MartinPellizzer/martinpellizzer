                    <h1>Heteropterys fulva</h1>
<p>Heteropterys fulva, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that thrives on host trees in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that allow it to extract water and nutrients from its host. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Heteropterys fulva plays a significant role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and supporting biodiversity.</p>
