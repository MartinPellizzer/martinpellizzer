                    <h1>Hymenophyllum trichophyllum var. contracta</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum trichophyllum var. contracta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf toothed fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, lanceolate leaves with a serrated margin, and its fronds are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant has a dense, compact growth habit and produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in tropical forest ecosystems.</p>
