<p>Hieracium columbianum, commonly known as the Columbian hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides, thriving in full sun. Its yellow-orange flowers are surrounded by pale green ray florets, and it produces small, rough, bristly seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Hieracium columbianum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to colonize new areas quickly.</p>
