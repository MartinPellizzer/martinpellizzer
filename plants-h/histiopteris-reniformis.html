                    <h1>Histiopteris reniformis</h1>
<p>Histiopteris reniformis, commonly known as the kidney fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are often deeply lobed. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>The kidney fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
