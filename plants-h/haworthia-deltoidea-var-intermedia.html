                    <h1>Haworthia deltoidea var. intermedia</h1>
<p>Haworthia deltoidea var. intermedia, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves with distinctive white to pale blue markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The leaves are typically green with a bluish tint and have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers on tall, slender stems during the summer months.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
