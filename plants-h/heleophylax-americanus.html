<p>Heleophylax americanus, commonly known as the American sun fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has long, creeping rhizomes that help anchor it to submerged substrates. Its feathery, light green fronds are adapted for photosynthesis in low-light aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Heleophylax americanus plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
