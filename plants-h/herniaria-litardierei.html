                    <h1>Herniaria litardierei</h1>
<p>Herniaria litardierei, commonly known as the rock crassworts, is a low-growing plant characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, greenish-blue leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It is typically found in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ability to thrive in harsh conditions make it an important species in certain ecological contexts.</p>
