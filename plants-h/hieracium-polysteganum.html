<p>Hieracium polysteganum, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosettes of leaves, which are typically covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it can outcompete native flora and is sometimes considered a weed.</p>
