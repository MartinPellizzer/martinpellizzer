<p>Huperzia costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican huperzia, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect, and often branched stems covered with small, scale-like leaves. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as tropical forests, where it thrives in the understory. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the leaves, a feature common among ferns.</p>
<p>Huperzia costaricensis plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for various organisms.</p>
