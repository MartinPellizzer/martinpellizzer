                <h1>Heteroderis pusilla</h1>
<p>Heteroderis pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf root-knot nematode, is a microscopic, plant-parasitic nematode belonging to the family Heteroderidae.</p>
<p>It primarily infests the roots of various agricultural crops, causing galls that disrupt nutrient uptake and weaken the host plant. The life cycle of Heteroderis pusilla involves egg-laying in soil, with larvae penetrating root tissue to establish feeding sites. It is particularly damaging to solanaceous crops like tomatoes and potatoes.</p>
<p>Due to its small size and cryptic life stage, it is often difficult to detect without specialized diagnostic techniques.</p>
