                    <h1>Hakea pachypoda</h1>
<p>Hakea pachypoda, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and distinctive, cylindrical flower spikes that bloom in winter. The plant has adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden environments, making it highly resilient to coastal conditions. Its root system is deep and extensive, helping it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Hakea pachypoda plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for native wildlife.</p>
