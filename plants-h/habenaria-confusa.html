                    <h1>Habenaria confusa</h1>
<p>Habenaria confusa, commonly known as the confused orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often in the understory of tropical rainforests. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with prominent yellow markings, which are characteristic of the Orchidaceae family. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the acidic, nutrient-poor soils of its habitat.</p>
<p>Habenaria confusa is known for its relatively small size and is often found growing on rocks or among leaf litter.</p>
