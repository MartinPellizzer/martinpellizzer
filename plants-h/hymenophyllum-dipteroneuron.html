                    <h1>Hymenophyllum dipteroneuron</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum dipteroneuron, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mistletoe fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees in the understory of forests. Its fronds are covered with a fine, velvety layer of trichomes, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the leaves and are protected by a membranous cover.</p>
