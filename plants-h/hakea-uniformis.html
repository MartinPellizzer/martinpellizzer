                    <h1>Hakea uniformis</h1>
<p>Hakea uniformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red, typically blooming in spring. Its woody stems and compact growth habit make it well adapted to coastal and sandy soils.</p>
<p>Hakea uniformis is often used in native landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
