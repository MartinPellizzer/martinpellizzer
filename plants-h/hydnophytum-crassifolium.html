                    <h1>Hydnophytum crassifolium</h1>
<p>Hydnophytum crassifolium, commonly known as the broad-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of tropical trees.</p>
<p>It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host plant's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant has thick, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in its often humid and shaded habitat. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers, followed by fleshy, red berries that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a role in shaping forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and biodiversity.</p>
