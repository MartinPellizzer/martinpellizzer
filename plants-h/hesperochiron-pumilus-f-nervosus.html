                    <h1>Hesperochiron pumilus f. nervosus</h1>
<p>Hesperochiron pumilus f. nervosus, commonly known as the nervy dwarf bladderwort, is a rare aquatic plant characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used for capturing prey.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, nutrient-rich waters, where it thrives in the presence of sunlight. The plant's leaves are thin and ribbon-like, with a distinctive network of veins that give it its 'nervosus' designation. Its specialized bladders allow it to trap small aquatic organisms, contributing to its role as a carnivorous plant.</p>
<p>This variant is less common than the typical form of Hesperochiron pumilus and is often found in specific, localized habitats.</p>
