                            <h1>Hieracium Pontanum</h1>
<p>Hieracium pontanum, commonly known as the Pontic hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy stems, which help it thrive in rocky and dry environments. This species belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ability to colonize disturbed soils. While it is often considered a weed, it plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecosystem diversity. Its resilience and adaptability make it a fascinating subject for ecological study.</p>
