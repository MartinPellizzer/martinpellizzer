                    <h1>Hydrangea arborescens f. sterilis</h1>
<p>Hydrangea arborescens f. sterilis, commonly known as the smooth hydrangea, is a sterile variant of the white hydrangea.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rounded, leafy growth habit and the absence of flowering, which is a result of its genetic makeup. The plant typically features large, serrated leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>This form is often used as a foliage plant due to its ornamental leaves and ability to form dense thickets.</p>
