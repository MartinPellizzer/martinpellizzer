                    <h1>Houstonia longifolia var. compacta</h1>
<p>Houstonia longifolia var. compacta, commonly known as the compact blue-eyed grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features small, clustered flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tiny seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland areas or along streambanks.</p>
<p>This variety is more compact than the typical form, making it well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover.</p>
