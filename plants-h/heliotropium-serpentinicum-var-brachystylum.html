                    <h1>Heliotropium serpentinicum var. brachystylum</h1>
<p>Heliotropium serpentinicum var. brachystylum, commonly known as the serpentine heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling those of the common heliotrope. The plant is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, calcareous soils, particularly on serpentine rock formations. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is noted for its resilience and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.</p>
