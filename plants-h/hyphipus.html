                    <h1>Hyphipus</h1>
<p>Hyphipus, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Melanthiaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, most of which are herbaceous perennials native to North America. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating. Hyphipus species produce small, greenish flowers that are clustered in umbels, and they are often found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>These plants are not closely related to true hellebores but share some similar characteristics.</p>
