                    <h1>Hesperodoria salicina</h1>
<p>Hesperodoria salicina, commonly known as the coastal dune lichen, is a symbiotic composite organism composed of a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium.</p>
<p>It thrives in harsh coastal environments, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing sandy soils and preventing erosion. The plant forms a dense, crust-like growth that can withstand high salt exposure and strong winds. Its reproductive structures are microscopic, and it reproduces through the dispersal of spores carried by wind.</p>
<p>Hesperodoria salicina is an important indicator species for assessing the health of coastal ecosystems.</p>
