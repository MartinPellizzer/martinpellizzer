                    <h1>Hoya skinneriana</h1>
<p>Hoya skinneriana, commonly known as the "Wax Plant" or "Floral Crown," is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink in color, blooming infrequently. Hoya skinneriana thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ability to climb make it a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
