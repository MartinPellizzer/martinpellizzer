                    <h1>Hieracium bogense</h1>
<p>Hieracium bogense, commonly known as the bog buttercup, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in bogs or marshes, and thrives in areas with high humidity. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss, while its flowers bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>Hieracium bogense plays a role in supporting local insect populations, particularly pollinators like bees and flies.</p>
