<p>Hedysarum polycarpon, commonly known as the many-seeded milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry grasslands and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Hedysarum polycarpon plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
