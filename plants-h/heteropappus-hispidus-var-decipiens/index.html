<p>Goatweed, scientifically known as Heteropappus hispidus var. decipiens, is a hardy plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, fields, and rocky outcrops. This plant is characterized by its fuzzy, gray-green leaves and small yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Despite its unassuming appearance, goatweed has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its resilience and adaptability make it a common yet often overlooked member of the aster family.</p>
