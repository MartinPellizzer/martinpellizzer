<p>Hydatica stellaris var. minor, commonly known as the lesser starflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features delicate, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale blue, typically in late spring to early summer. The plant has a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, hairy fruits that disperse its seeds by wind. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.</p>
