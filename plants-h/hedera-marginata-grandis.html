<p>Hedera marginata-grandis, commonly known as the giant marginated ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features dark green, lobed leaves with a distinctive white or pale margin, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by orange-red berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a desirable and sometimes invasive species in certain regions.</p>
