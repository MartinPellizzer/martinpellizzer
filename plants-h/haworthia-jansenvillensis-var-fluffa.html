<p>Haworthia jansenvillensis var. fluffa, commonly known as the Fluffy Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically a pale green to bluish-gray in color. The leaves are covered in fine, white to pale blue hairs, giving the plant its distinctive "fluffy" appearance. It produces small, star-shaped white or pale yellow flowers on slender stems during the summer months.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light.</p>
