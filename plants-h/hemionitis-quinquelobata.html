                    <h1>Hemionitis quinquelobata</h1>
<p>Hemionitis quinquelobata, commonly known as the five-lobed hemionitis, is a rare and unique fern species native to the mountainous regions of central China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are divided into five distinct lobes, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Hemionitis quinquelobata is considered an endangered species.</p>
