                    <h1>Heracleum umbonatum</h1>
<p>Heracleum umbonatum, commonly known as cow parsnip, is a tall biennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, umbrella-shaped compound leaves and yellowish-green flowers that appear in clustered inflorescences. The plant contains toxic compounds, including furanocoumarins, which can cause photodermatitis upon skin contact followed by sunlight exposure. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and forest edges.</p>
<p>Despite its potential to cause skin irritation, it plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
