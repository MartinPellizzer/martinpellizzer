<p>Hearnia sapindina, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and smooth, often reddish-barked trunk.

It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in lowland forests or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions.</p>
