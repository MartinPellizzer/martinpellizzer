<p>Halanthium rarifolium, commonly known as the rare-leaved water plantain, is a species of aquatic plant found in freshwater environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged or floating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters with muddy or sandy substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of water quality.</p>
