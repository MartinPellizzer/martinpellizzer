                    <h1>Humirianthera crispula</h1>
<p>Humirianthera crispula, commonly known as the curly-leaved marsh plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in South America.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often curled or crinkled, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy areas or along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists studying wetland ecosystems.</p>
