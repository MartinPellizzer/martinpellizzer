<p>Himantoglossum jankae subsp.</p>
<p>rumelicum, commonly known as the Alpine lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and its distinctive inflorescence of small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in a loose spiral.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in mountain meadows or on limestone slopes. It is a perennial herb that thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its alpine habitat.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, this species is considered endangered in many parts of its range.</p>
