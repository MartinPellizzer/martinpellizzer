<p>Hieracium amplexicaule subsp.</p>
<p>rupicola, commonly known as the rock hawksbeard, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly lanceolate, hairy leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in rocky and alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in leaf structure and habitat preference.</p>
<p>It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in dry, sunny slopes and scree areas.</p>
