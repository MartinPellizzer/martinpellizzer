                    <h1>Holboellia coriacea</h1>
<p>Holboellia coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf holboellia, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, round fruits. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Holboellia coriacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
