                    <h1>Heracleum sphondylium var. montanum</h1>
<p>Heracleum sphondylium var. montanum, commonly known as mountain hogweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces large, umbrella-shaped inflorescences composed of small, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are large, deeply lobed, and have a distinctive, fern-like appearance.</p>
<p>While it is not as toxic as its relative, giant hogweed, it can still cause skin irritation upon contact with its sap.</p>
