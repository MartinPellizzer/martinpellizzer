                    <h1>Humata kingii</h1>
<p>Humata kingii, commonly known as the King's humata, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spirally arranged leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale yellow to orange, typically blooming during the cooler months. Humata kingii is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it a resilient species in its native environment.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and is often protected in conservation programs.</p>
