                            <h1>Hypoxis Fabricia</h1>
<p>Yellow starbursts, scientifically known as Hypoxis fabricia, are small, delicate plants native to southern Africa. They are named for their bright yellow flowers that resemble tiny starbursts, creating a striking visual impact in gardens. This species thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a versatile choice for many landscapes. Despite their beauty, they are often overlooked in favor of more showy plants. Their resilience and low maintenance requirements make them a valuable addition to both wild and cultivated environments.</p>
