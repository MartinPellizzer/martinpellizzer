<p>Hieracium spelaeoides, commonly known as the cave dandelion, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to subterranean environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in low-light conditions. The plant typically grows in caves and rock crevices, where it relies on limited light and specific humidity levels for survival. Its leaves are usually dark green and thick, allowing it to store water efficiently.</p>
<p>Due to its unique habitat, Hieracium spelaeoides is considered an endangered species with a very restricted distribution.</p>
