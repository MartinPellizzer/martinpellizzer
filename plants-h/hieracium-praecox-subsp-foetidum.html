<p>Hieracium praecox subsp.</p>
<p>foetidum, commonly known as stinking hawkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy stems.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces a strong, unpleasant odor, which is likely a defense mechanism against herbivores.</p>
<p>Its subspecies status reflects subtle differences in morphology and habitat preference compared to other Hieracium species.</p>
