                            <h1>Helianthus Radula</h1>
<p>Helianthus radula is a rare and intriguing species of sunflower native to the southeastern United States. This plant is known for its unique ability to thrive in wetland environments, often found along the edges of swamps and marshes. Its name, meaning "dripping sunflower," refers to the way its leaves appear to drip with moisture. Despite its delicate appearance, it plays a vital role in supporting local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and birds. Studying Helianthus radula offers valuable insights into plant adaptation and conservation efforts in wetland habitats.</p>
