                    <h1>Holigarna albicans</h1>
<p>Holigarna albicans, commonly known as the white lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically on bark, stone, or soil. The algal component provides photosynthetic capabilities, while the fungal partner offers structural support and protection. Its white or pale coloration is due to the presence of the algal cells within the fungal matrix.</p>
<p>This lichen is often used as an indicator species for air quality and ecological health.</p>
