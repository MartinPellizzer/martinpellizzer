<p>Hygrophila guianensis var. angustior, commonly known as narrow-leaved hygrophila, is a perennial aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes, and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the substrate, while its stems are often submerged or partially submerged.</p>
<p>This variety is valued in aquascaping for its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
