                    <h1>Hymenophyllum wilsonii var. achalense</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum wilsonii var. achalense, commonly known as the Achalense filmy fern, is a rare and delicate epiphytic fern belonging to the Hymenophyllaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sporangia located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest in botanical research.</p>
