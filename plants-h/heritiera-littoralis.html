<p>Heritiera littoralis, commonly known as the coastal heritiera, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or saline soils along shorelines. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt-excreting glands. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in panicles and bloom during the rainy season.</p>
<p>The fruit is a capsule that releases seeds when mature, contributing to its adaptation to coastal environments.</p>
