                    <h1>Hieracium progrediens</h1>
<p>Hieracium progrediens, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and slender, ascending stems that produce numerous yellow flowers. The plant has finely divided, serrated leaves and produces small, disc-shaped flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in wetlands.</p>
<p>Hieracium progrediens is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively.</p>
