<p>Helianthemum virgatum subsp.</p>
<p>maritimum, commonly known as the sea holly, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of southern Europe. It features compact, mat-forming growth with silvery-gray foliage that reflects sunlight, aiding in heat resistance.</p>
<p>The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and coastal conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
