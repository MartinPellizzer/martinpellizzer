<p>Harrisella, commonly known as the common harrisella, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to various regions of Africa, particularly in the savannas and grasslands. The plants typically have hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves, which help in reducing water loss in arid environments. Harrisella species produce small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>These plants are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.</p>
