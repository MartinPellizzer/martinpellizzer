                    <h1>Hedysarum sikkimense var. rigidum</h1>
<p>Hedysarum sikkimense var. rigidum, commonly known as the rigid Himalayan vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in raceme clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often found in open meadows and forest margins.</p>
<p>Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it ecologically significant in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
