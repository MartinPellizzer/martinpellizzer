<p>Hordeum eriwanense, commonly known as Eriwan barley, is a species of grass native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial plant that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, showcasing adaptations to harsh climatic conditions. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with lemma and palea structures typical of the Poaceae family. Its seeds are encased in a tough, protective hull, which aids in seed dispersal and survival in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Hordeum eriwanense is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native habitats.</p>
