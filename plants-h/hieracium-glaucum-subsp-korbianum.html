<p>Hieracium glaucum subsp.</p>
<p>korbianum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in the summer.</p>
<p>The plant is adapted to cold, rocky environments and is often found in high-altitude meadows and mountain slopes. It has a shallow root system and is relatively short-lived, with a lifespan of up to five years.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
