<p>Hymenophyllum fucoides var. cristatum, commonly known as the cristate spore moss, is a rare and specialized fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, intricate foliage and small, spore-producing structures called sporangia. This variety is distinguished by its unique, crest-like growth pattern, which gives it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often considered an indicator species for undisturbed, humid microhabitats.</p>
