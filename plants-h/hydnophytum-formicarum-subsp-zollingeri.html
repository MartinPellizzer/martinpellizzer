<p>Hydnophytum formicarum subsp.</p>
<p>zollingeri, commonly known as the ant plant, is a hemi-parasitic plant that forms a symbiotic relationship with ants. It produces specialized structures called domatia, which serve as shelter for ant colonies.</p>
<p>The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while the ants protect it from herbivores. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and is often found in lowland rainforests.</p>
<p>Its unique botanical features make it an important subject in studies of plant-ant interactions.</p>
