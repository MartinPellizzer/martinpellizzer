                    <h1>Hydrocleys cryptopetala</h1>
<p>Hydrocleys cryptopetala, commonly known as the marsh mallow or swamp mallow, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the wet season. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread across wetland areas, forming dense mats.</p>
<p>Hydrocleys cryptopetala is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes.</p>
