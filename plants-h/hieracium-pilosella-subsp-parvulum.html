<p>Hieracium pilosella subsp.</p>
<p>parvulum, commonly known as the small hairy hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features a rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in clusters.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. Its flowers are often followed by seed heads that are easily dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>It is considered a weedy species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas.</p>
