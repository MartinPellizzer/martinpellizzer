<p>Hedysarum uncinatum, commonly known as burr vetch, is a perennial legume native to the central and eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, rounded leaflets and its distinctive, hooked fruit pods that aid in seed dispersal. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woods, meadows, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Hedysarum uncinatum is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
