<p>Herniaria pisidica, commonly known as the rock crassworts, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal and limestone habitats.</p>
<p>Its compact growth form and ability to tolerate harsh conditions make it a hardy and resilient species.</p>
