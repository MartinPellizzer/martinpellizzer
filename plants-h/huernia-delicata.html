                    <h1>Huernia delicata</h1>
<p>Huernia delicata, commonly known as the delicate horned cactus, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, rounded stem covered in small, spiny tubercles that give it a unique, almost coral-like appearance. The plant produces pale yellow or greenish flowers during the warmer months, typically in summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections.</p>
