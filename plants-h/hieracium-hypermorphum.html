<p>Hieracium hypermorphum, commonly known as the giant hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and its stems are often reddish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in areas outside its native range.</p>
