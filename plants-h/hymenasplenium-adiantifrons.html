                    <h1>Hymenasplenium adiantifrons</h1>
<p>Hymenasplenium adiantifrons, commonly known as the broad-leaved water fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, finely divided structure that aids in water retention.</p>
<p>The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid habitats.</p>
