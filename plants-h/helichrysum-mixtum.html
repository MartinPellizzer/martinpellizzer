                    <h1>Helichrysum mixtum</h1>
<p>Helichrysum mixtum, commonly known as the everlasting or golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its clusters of small, yellow to orange flowers that resemble miniature sunflowers. The plant produces numerous tiny, papery bracts that give it a feathery appearance, which is why it is often used in floral arrangements. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Helichrysum mixtum is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
