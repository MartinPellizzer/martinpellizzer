                    <h1>Hetaeria nitida</h1>
<p>Hetaeria nitida, commonly known as the silverleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish thallus with a distinctive silvery bloom on the upper surface. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide nutrients through photosynthesis. Hetaeria nitida is often found on bark, stones, and soil in temperate regions.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and delicate structure make it a sensitive indicator of environmental health.</p>
