<p>Hedysarum truncatum, commonly known as the cutleaf vetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often deeply lobed and truncate at the base. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Hedysarum truncatum is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and is adapted to temperate climates.</p>
<p>Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it a valuable plant for erosion control.</p>
