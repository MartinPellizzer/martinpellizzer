                    <h1>Helothrix</h1>
<p>Helothrix, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that often go unnoticed. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly across the ground, forming dense mats.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Helothrix is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
