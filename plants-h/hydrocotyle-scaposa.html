                    <h1>Hydrocotyle scaposa</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle scaposa, commonly known as the water shield, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features floating and submerged leaves that are typically heart-shaped and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by dark, spherical berries. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle scaposa plays an important role in stabilizing water ecosystems and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
