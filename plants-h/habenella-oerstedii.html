<p>Habenella oerstedii, commonly known as the Oersted's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap insects. The plant typically grows in wet, nutrient-poor soils, often in bogs or marshes. Its leaves are slender and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Habenella oerstedii is known for its unique method of capturing prey, which it uses to supplement its nutrient intake in its challenging habitat.</p>
