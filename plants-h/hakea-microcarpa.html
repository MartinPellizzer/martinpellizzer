                    <h1>Hakea microcarpa</h1>
<p>Hakea microcarpa, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a white, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, pink or red flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody structure and ability to thrive in sandy soils make it well adapted to coastal and heathland habitats.</p>
<p>Hakea microcarpa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife.</p>
