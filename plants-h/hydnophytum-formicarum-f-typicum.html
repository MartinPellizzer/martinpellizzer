                    <h1>Hydnophytum formicarum f. typicum</h1>
<p>Hydnophytum formicarum f. typicum, commonly known as the ant plant, is a hemiparasitic shrub native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It forms a symbiotic relationship with ants, providing shelter and nectar in exchange for protection against herbivores. The plant has small, clustered leaves and produces yellowish flowers that attract insects for pollination. Its roots absorb nutrients from the soil, while its aerial roots connect to ant colonies.</p>
<p>This unique adaptation allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments.</p>
