<p>Haageocereus acranthus f. clavispinus, commonly known as the clustered night blooming cactus, is a unique cactus species native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny clusters of stems that form a low-growing shrub. The plant produces striking white flowers at night, which are highly fragrant and attract nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>This plant is well-suited for xeriscaping and requires minimal water once established.</p>
