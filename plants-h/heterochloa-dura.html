                    <h1>Heterochloa dura</h1>
<p>Heterochloa dura, commonly known as the hardy grass or desert grass, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-gray hue, which helps reduce water loss through transpiration. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Heterochloa dura is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and low maintenance requirements.</p>
