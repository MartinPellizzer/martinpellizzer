                    <h1>Hydriastele dransfieldii</h1>
<p>Hydriastele dransfieldii, commonly known as the Dransfield's hydriastele, is a rare and striking member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the humid lowland forests of northeastern South America, particularly in Brazil. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stem and rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater. Its inflorescence consists of a single, showy flower that emerges from the center of the rosette, typically in shades of white or pale pink.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
