                    <h1>Heracleum angustisectum</h1>
<p>Heracleum angustisectum, commonly known as narrow-leaf cowparnip, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb native to eastern North America, typically found in moist, woodland habitats. The plant features slender, ribbed stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in compound umbels, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic sap and potential for causing skin irritation, it is generally avoided for culinary or medicinal use.</p>
