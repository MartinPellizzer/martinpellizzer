                    <h1>Hieracium lacerilingua</h1>
<p>Hieracium lacerilingua, commonly known as the shredded leaf hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, almost lace-like appearance, hence its scientific name. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and it is often found in meadows and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions.</p>
