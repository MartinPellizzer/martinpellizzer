                    <h1>Hemionitis pallida</h1>
<p>Hemionitis pallida, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and unique plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale green fronds that resemble ghostly shapes, hence its common name. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and has adapted to extreme drought conditions. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typically found on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Hemionitis pallida is considered a living fossil, with a lineage dating back to the Mesozoic era.</p>
