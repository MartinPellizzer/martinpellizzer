                    <h1>Hydrocotyle siamica</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle siamica, commonly known as Siam water shield, is a floating aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, rounded leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface, allowing it to remain buoyant on water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by small, dark berries. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in marshes or ponds.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth makes it both a useful indicator of water quality and a potential invasive species in non-native regions.</p>
