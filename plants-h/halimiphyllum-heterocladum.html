<p>Halimiphyllum heterocladum, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are needle-like and covered in a waxy cuticle, helping to reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Halimiphyllum heterocladum is well adapted to salt spray and wind, making it a hardy species found in coastal ecosystems.</p>
