<p>Haworthia herrei, commonly known as the Zulu bulb, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves with white to pale blue markings, which help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss.

It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rock gardens or containers.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts.</p>
