                    <h1>Hiraea trianae</h1>
<p>Hiraea trianae, commonly known as the Tepuy cactus, is a species of cactus native to the tepuis of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, thick stems and spiny, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. Hiraea trianae is adapted to grow in rocky, nutrient-poor soils, making it a resilient species in high-altitude regions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
