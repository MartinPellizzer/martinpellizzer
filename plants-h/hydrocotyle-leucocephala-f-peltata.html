                    <h1>Hydrocotyle leucocephala f. peltata</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle leucocephala f. peltata, commonly known as the broadleaf marsh mallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soil. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a subtle ornamental value to its habitat. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>The leaves are often coated with a fine layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss in its wetland environment.</p>
