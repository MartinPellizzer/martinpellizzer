                    <h1>Hexotria</h1>
<p>Hexotria, commonly known as the golden star, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hexotria thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable choice for garden borders or woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant blooms and foliage that turns reddish in the fall.</p>
