                    <h1>Helichrysum pseudolitoreum</h1>
<p>Helichrysum pseudolitoreum, commonly known as the coastal everlasting or sand everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces small, yellowish to orange-colored flowers that are often mistaken for daisies. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils, making it well-suited for coastal environments. Its foliage is covered in fine, silvery hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Helichrysum pseudolitoreum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in garden settings where it can withstand harsh, sunny conditions.</p>
