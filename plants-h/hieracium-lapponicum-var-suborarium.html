                    <h1>Hieracium lapponicum var. suborarium</h1>
<p>Hieracium lapponicum var. suborarium, commonly known as the Lapland hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of northern Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, rocky, or sandy soils and thrives in cold, harsh environments. The plant has basal leaves that are usually woolly and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers are yellow and borne in a single head, with ray florets that are often shorter than the central disk.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact growth compared to other Hieracium species.</p>
