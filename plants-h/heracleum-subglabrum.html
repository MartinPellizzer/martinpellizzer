<p>Heracleum subglabrum, commonly known as giant hogweed, is a tall biennial or perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features large, umbrella-like compound leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, with a distinctive white, hairy underside. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in late summer, which are followed by spherical, hairy fruits. It is known for its toxic sap, which can cause severe skin irritation and photodermatitis when exposed to sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions.</p>
