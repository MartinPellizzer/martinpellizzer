                    <h1>Hofmeisteria viscosa</h1>
<p>Hofmeisteria viscosa, commonly known as the sticky hofmeisteria, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it grows in rocky and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance, which is thought to deter herbivores. It produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring, and its fruit is a capsule that releases seeds when mature.</p>
<p>Hofmeisteria viscosa is often found in shrubland and fynbos vegetation, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat.</p>
