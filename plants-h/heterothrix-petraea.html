                    <h1>Heterothrix petraea</h1>
<p>Heterothrix petraea, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing on limestone or sandstone surfaces. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body formed by the mutualistic relationship between the fungal and algal components. It plays a crucial role in soil formation and nutrient cycling in its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized adaptations, it is often used as an indicator species for environmental conditions.</p>
