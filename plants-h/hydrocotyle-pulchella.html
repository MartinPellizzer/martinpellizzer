                    <h1>Hydrocotyle pulchella</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle pulchella, commonly known as the pretty water penny, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of heart-shaped, glossy green leaves that are often floating or submerged in shallow water. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle pulchella plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
