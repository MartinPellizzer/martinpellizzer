<p>Halothamnus glaucus subsp.</p>
<p>cinerascens, commonly known as silver thistle, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and northern Africa. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in dense, glandular hairs that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, purple to pink flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance, it is considered a hardy plant adapted to harsh, dry environments.</p>
