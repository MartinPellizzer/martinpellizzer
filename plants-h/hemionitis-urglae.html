                    <h1>Hemionitis urglae</h1>
<p>Hemionitis urglae, commonly known as the desert shield fern, is a unique vascular plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in harsh, dry environments and is adapted to extreme temperature fluctuations. The plant has a distinctive rosette growth form with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in the axils of the leaves.</p>
<p>Hemionitis urglae is considered a relict species, reflecting ancient plant lineages that once had a broader geographic distribution.</p>
