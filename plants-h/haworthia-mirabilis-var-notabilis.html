<p>Haworthia mirabilis var. notabilis, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, rosette-forming succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features striking, dark green leaves with white to pale yellow markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant produces tall, slender flower stalks with small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and rock gardens.</p>
