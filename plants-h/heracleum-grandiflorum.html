                    <h1>Heracleum grandiflorum</h1>
<p>Heracleum grandiflorum, commonly known as giant hogweed, is a tall biennial or perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features large, umbrella-shaped compound leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in a spherical inflorescence, which are pollinated by insects. Its stem is covered in coarse hairs and has a milky sap that can cause severe skin irritation.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it is often considered a noxious weed in many regions.</p>
