<p>Hieracium repandum var. cremnaeiforme, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit, with numerous flowering stems that produce small, yellowish to reddish composite flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>This variant is notable for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive.</p>
