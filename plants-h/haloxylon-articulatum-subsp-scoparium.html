<p>Haloxylon articulatum subsp.</p>
<p>scoparium, commonly known as the desert date or saxaul, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its woody stems, which often have a reddish or brownish color, and its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers followed by small, edible fruits that are important for both wildlife and humans.</p>
<p>It is highly drought-tolerant and plays a crucial role in stabilizing desert soils and preventing erosion.</p>
