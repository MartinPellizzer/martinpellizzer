<p>Hylotelephium ettyuense, commonly known as the Ettyuense stonecrop, is a perennial succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the summer months. It is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its compact growth habit and attractive foliage.</p>
<p>Hylotelephium ettyuense is relatively low-maintenance, requiring well-draining soil and full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
