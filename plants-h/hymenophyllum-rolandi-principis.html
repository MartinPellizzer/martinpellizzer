                    <h1>Hymenophyllum rolandi-principis</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum rolandi-principis, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small epiphytic fern belonging to the Hymenophyllaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor conditions, making it a common sight in montane and coastal forest ecosystems.</p>
