<p>Herbertia pulchella, commonly known as the showy herbertia, is a striking perennial plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white or grayish hairs. The plant produces tall, slender stems that bear clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. These flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Herbertia pulchella is well-suited for rock gardens or dry landscapes due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
