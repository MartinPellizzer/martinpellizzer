<p>Hemigymnia malabarica, commonly known as the Malabar banyan, is a tropical tree native to the Western Ghats of India.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Moraceae and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and distinctive aerial roots. The plant exhibits hemiepiphytic growth, meaning it starts life as an epiphyte on other plants before establishing its own roots in the soil.

<p>This species plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.</p>
