<p>Herniaria glabra var. guadarramica, commonly known as the Guadarramica sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, pale green leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny white flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
