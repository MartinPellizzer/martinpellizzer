<p>Hieracium murorum subsp.</p>
<p>pellucidulum, commonly known as the translucent hawkweed, is a member of the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and hairy stems, with leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine pubescence.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its subtle appearance, it can be challenging to distinguish from other hawkweed species without careful examination.</p>
