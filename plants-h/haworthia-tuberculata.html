<p>Haworthia tuberculata, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa.</p>

The plant is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves. It produces small, greenish-white flowers on tall, slender stems during the warmer months.</p>
<p>Haworthia tuberculata is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and aesthetic appeal.</p>
