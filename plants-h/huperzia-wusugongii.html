                    <h1>Huperzia wusugongii</h1>
<p>Huperzia wusugongii, commonly known as the Wusugong huperzia, is a rare and primitive fern species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Huperziaceae and is characterized by its simple, needle-like leaves and strobilus-bearing fronds. The plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous regions. Its spore-producing structures are prominently located on the upper surface of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
