                    <h1>Helianthemum marifolium f. argyreum</h1>
<p>Helianthemum marifolium f. argyreum, commonly known as the silverleaf rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features dense, silvery-gray foliage that reflects sunlight and reduces water loss, an adaptation to its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a bright touch to rocky or sandy soils. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The variety 'argyreum' is distinguished by its particularly dense and reflective leaf covering, enhancing its ornamental value.</p>
