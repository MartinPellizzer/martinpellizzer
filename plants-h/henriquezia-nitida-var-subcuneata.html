<p>Henriquezia nitida var. subcuneata, commonly known as the narrow-angled henriquezia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
