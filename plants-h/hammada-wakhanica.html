<p>Hammada wakhanica, commonly known as the Wakhan prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and flat, paddle-shaped leaves that are adapted to arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by edible fruits similar to those of other prickly pear species. It is well-suited to dry, rocky soils and can thrive in regions with low rainfall.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
