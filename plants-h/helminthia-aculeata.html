<p>Helminthia aculeata, commonly known as the spiny hellebore, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It features dark green, lance-shaped leaves with prominent veins and is characterized by its spiny, erect stems. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by poisonous, red berries. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care.</p>
