<p>Horridocactus choapensis, commonly known as the Choapense cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the cloud forests of western Costa Rica.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a slow growth rate and is adapted to the humid, shaded conditions of its natural habitat. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in the wet, tropical environment.</p>
<p>Horridocactus choapensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.</p>
