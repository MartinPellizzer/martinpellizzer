                    <h1>Heracleum viscosum</h1>
<p>Heracleum viscosum, commonly known as cow parsnip, is a tall biennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features a robust, hollow stem that is often covered with fine hairs, and its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and deeply lobed. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbrella-like inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. Its sap contains irritants that can cause skin reactions, so it is often avoided when handling.</p>
<p>Cow parsnip is commonly found in moist meadows, stream banks, and disturbed soils.</p>
