<p>Heynella, commonly known as the "bitterroot," is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of several species, most of which are native to western North America, particularly in the United States and Canada. These plants are characterized by their compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple.
