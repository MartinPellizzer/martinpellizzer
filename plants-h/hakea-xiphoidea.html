                    <h1>Hakea xiphoidea</h1>
<p>Hakea xiphoidea, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powder, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody structure and adaptability to coastal environments make it a hardy, drought-tolerant species.</p>
<p>Hakea xiphoidea is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
