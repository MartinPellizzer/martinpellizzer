<p>Humboltia aspera, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and thick, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds.</p>
<p>Humboltia aspera is adapted to thrive in harsh, low-water conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.</p>
