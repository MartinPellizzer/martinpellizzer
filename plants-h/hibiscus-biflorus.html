                    <h1>Hibiscus biflorus</h1>
<p>Hibiscus biflorus, commonly known as the two-flowered hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically have five to seven petals and a prominent, five-lobed stigma. The plant produces two types of flowers on the same inflorescence: one fertile and one sterile, a unique feature that distinguishes it from other hibiscus species. Hibiscus biflorus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological studies.</p>
