                    <h1>Hexastylis minor</h1>
<p>Hexastylis minor, commonly known as the small-leaf false shamrock, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The flowers are often overlooked due to their modest size, but they play a role in attracting small pollinators.</p>
