                    <h1>Hordeum spontaneum var. ithaburense</h1>
<p>Hordeum spontaneum var. ithaburense, commonly known as wild barley, is a wild grass species native to various regions of the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and spikelets that contain two to three small, awned grains. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It plays a significant role in ecological studies due to its genetic diversity and potential agricultural value.</p>
<p>Hordeum spontaneum var. ithaburense is also of interest in research related to crop improvement and climate resilience.</p>
