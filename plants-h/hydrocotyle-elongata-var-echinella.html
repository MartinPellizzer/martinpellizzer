<p>Hydrocotyle elongata var. echinella, commonly known as the spiny arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with some leaves emerging above the water surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, spiny fruits. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes.</p>
<p>Its unique leaf morphology and spiny fruit make it easily identifiable in wetland habitats.</p>
