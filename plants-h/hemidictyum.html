<p>Hemidictyum, commonly known as the water fern, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their delicate, feather-like fronds that are often submerged or floating in freshwater habitats. Hemidictyum species typically grow in shallow, still or slow-moving waters, such as ponds and marshes. Their rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, each adapted to specific environmental conditions, showcasing a variety of morphological features.</p>
