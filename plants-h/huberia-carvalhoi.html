<p>Huberia carvalhoi, commonly known as the Carvalho's orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically display vibrant colors such as pink and purple. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its humid, shaded habitat. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Huberia carvalhoi is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.</p>
