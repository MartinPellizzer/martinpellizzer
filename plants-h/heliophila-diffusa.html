<p>Heliophila diffusa, commonly known as water heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from June to August. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to its aquatic environment. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland areas.</p>
<p>Heliophila diffusa is also a valuable food source for various aquatic insects and invertebrates.</p>
