<p>Helictotrichon pratense subsp.</p>
<p>gonzaloi, commonly known as the Gonzalo's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of southern South America. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy, and it produces small, blue to purple flowers in panicles during the spring and summer. It is well adapted to high-altitude environments and can tolerate cold temperatures and poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and limited distribution.</p>
