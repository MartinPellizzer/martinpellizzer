<p>Hydrocotyle macrodonta, commonly known as the broadleaf water shield, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has floating leaves that are broadly heart-shaped with a waxy surface, and it produces small, white flowers that bloom from late spring to early fall. Its root system helps stabilize sediment and improve water quality by filtering nutrients.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle macrodonta plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
