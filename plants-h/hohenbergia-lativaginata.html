                    <h1>Hohenbergia lativaginata</h1>
<p>Hohenbergia lativaginata, commonly known as the broad-sheath hohenbergia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its dense, rosette-like arrangement of fleshy, sword-shaped leaves. The leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps the plant retain moisture in its natural habitat. It produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, typically emerging from the center of the rosette.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to shady, humid environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental bromeliad.</p>
