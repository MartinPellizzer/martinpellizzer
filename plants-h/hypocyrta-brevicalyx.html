                    <h1>Hypocyrta brevicalyx</h1>
<p>Hypocyrta brevicalyx, commonly known as the broad-leaved cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often broad and leathery. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and thrives in humid, warm climates.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
