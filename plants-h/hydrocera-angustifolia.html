                    <h1>Hydrocera angustifolia</h1>
<p>Hydrocera angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that float on the water surface or rise from the substrate. Its small, white flowers appear in dense spikes and are often pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>Hydrocera angustifolia plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and stabilizing water bodies.</p>
