                    <h1>Habenaria eburnea</h1>
<p>Habenaria eburnea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and captivating orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white, spider-like flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling a ghostly apparition. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as endangered in many areas.</p>
