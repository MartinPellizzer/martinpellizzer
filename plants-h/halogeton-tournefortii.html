                    <h1>Halogeton tournefortii</h1>
<p>Halogeton tournefortii, commonly known as the desert barley or sand barley, is a halophytic plant adapted to arid and saline environments.</p>
<p>It is native to the deserts of Central Asia and the Middle East, where it thrives in extreme conditions with high salt content in the soil. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed and barren soils.</p>
<p>Halogeton tournefortii plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitats.</p>
