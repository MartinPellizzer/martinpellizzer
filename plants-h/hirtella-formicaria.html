<p>Hirtella formicaria, commonly known as the ant-plant, is a shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, clustered white flowers. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with ants, providing them with shelter and nectar in exchange for protection against herbivores. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss and deter pests.</p>
<p>Hirtella formicaria is an important component of the understory vegetation in tropical rainforests.</p>
