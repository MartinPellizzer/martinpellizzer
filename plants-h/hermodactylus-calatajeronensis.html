                    <h1>Hermodactylus calatajeronensis</h1>
<p>Hermodactylus calatajeronensis, commonly known as the Socotra starfish flower, is a unique flowering plant native to the Socotra archipelago.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its star-shaped, fleshy, and brightly colored flowers that resemble a starfish, hence its common name. The plant has a succulent stem and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. It blooms during the rainy season, producing clusters of flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and moths.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.</p>
