<p>Hymenophyllum fucoides var. chachapoyense, commonly known as the Chachapoyan shield fern, is a rare and delicate epiphytic fern native to the cloud forests of the Andes.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery, and often densely packed leaves. The fronds are typically dark green with a metallic sheen and are covered in tiny, scale-like structures called rhizoids. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
