                    <h1>Hordeum × secalinoides</h1>
<p>Hordeum × secalinoides, commonly known as intermediate barley, is a naturally occurring hybrid between barley (Hordeum vulgare) and hulless barley (Hordeum spontaneum).</p>
<p>It exhibits a combination of traits from both parent species, including intermediate characteristics in morphology and growth habits. The plant typically has a robust stem and produces spikelets with both hulled and hulless grains. It is often found in temperate regions and is used in agricultural research for its genetic diversity.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a bridge species in the evolution of barley varieties.</p>
