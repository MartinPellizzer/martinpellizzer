<p>Hakea laevipes subsp.</p>
<p>graniticola, commonly known as the granite hakea, is a shrub native to the southwestern regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical or conical inflorescences that bear bright yellow flowers, which are typically visited by birds and insects.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This subspecies thrives in granitic soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy plant in dry, rocky environments.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important component of its native ecosystems.</p>
