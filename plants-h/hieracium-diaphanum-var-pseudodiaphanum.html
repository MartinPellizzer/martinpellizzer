                    <h1>Hieracium diaphanum var. pseudodiaphanum</h1>
<p>Hieracium diaphanum var. pseudodiaphanum, commonly known as the translucent hawkweed, is a variant of the hawkweed genus native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, often hairless leaves and yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and may have a translucent or waxy appearance, contributing to its common name.</p>
<p>This variant is part of a species complex that includes several other similar-looking hawkweeds, making it challenging to distinguish without close examination.</p>
