<p>Heliophila macrosperma, commonly known as the broad-leaved water plantain, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland and aquatic environments.</p>
<p>It features slender, erect stems that often grow in shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and typically have a waxy surface to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Heliophila macrosperma is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
