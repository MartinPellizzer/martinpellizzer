<p>Hieracium liptoviense subsp.</p>
<p>borzawae, commonly known as the Liptovsk√° Borzava hawkweed, is a rare flowering plant native to the Carpathian Mountains. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow, daisy-like flowers and hairy stems.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its specific morphology, including leaf shape and flower structure, which set it apart from other Hieracium species. It thrives in mountain meadows and rocky habitats, often in areas with limited soil nutrients.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
