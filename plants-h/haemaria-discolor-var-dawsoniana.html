                    <h1>Haemaria discolor var. dawsoniana</h1>
<p>Haemaria discolor var. dawsoniana, commonly known as Dawson's ghost flower, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale blue to violet flowers that appear in late summer, often in clusters at the ends of its slender stems. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, giving it a ghostly appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
