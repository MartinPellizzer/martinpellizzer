<p>Hypolepis californica, commonly known as the California water fern, is a perennial fern native to western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically submerged or floating in water. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in ponds, streams, and marshes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Hypolepis californica plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
