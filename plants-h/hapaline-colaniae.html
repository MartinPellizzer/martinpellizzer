                    <h1>Hapaline colaniae</h1>
<p>Hapaline colaniae, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, delicate white or pale green flowers. The plant relies on specific symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient uptake, as it cannot photosynthesize due to the absence of chlorophyll. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a distinctive three-lobed structure.</p>
<p>Hapaline colaniae is adapted to grow on the bark of trees in wet, shaded environments, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
