                    <h1>Hypericum rumeliacum var. georgievii</h1>
<p>Hypericum rumeliacum var. georgievii, commonly known as the Georgian St. John's Wort, is a rare and distinctive variant of the St. John's Wort genus.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and narrow, linear leaves, which are typical of the Hypericum family. This plant is native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus, particularly Georgia, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. It blooms in late summer, producing clusters of bright yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
