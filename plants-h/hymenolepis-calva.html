<p>Hymenolepis calva, commonly known as the slender tapeworm, is a parasitic flatworm that primarily infects rodents and occasionally humans.</p>
<p>It belongs to the class Caryophylli and is characterized by its long, slender body composed of numerous proglottids. The plant-like structure of its body is a defining feature, with a scolex equipped with hooks and a rostellum for attachment to the host's intestinal wall. Its life cycle involves a definitive host and an intermediate host, typically a flea.</p>
<p>Hymenolepis calva is notable for its ability to cause hymenolepiasis, a disease that can lead to malnutrition and other health complications in infected individuals.</p>
