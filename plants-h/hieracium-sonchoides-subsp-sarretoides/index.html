<p>Lesser spear thistle, scientifically known as Hieracium sonchoides subsp. sarretoides, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies, sunflowers, and other composite flowers. This thistle is characterized by its spiny leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It often grows in disturbed soils and open habitats such as roadsides and fields. Despite its prickly appearance, it plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas.</p>
