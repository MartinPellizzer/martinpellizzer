<p>Helianthemum marifolium subsp.</p>
<p>frigidulum, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid, high-altitude habitat.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a splash of color to rocky and sandy soils. It is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including strong winds and intense sunlight.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its resilience and ornamental appeal in rocky gardens.</p>
