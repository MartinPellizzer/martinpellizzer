                    <h1>Helianthemum ledifolium</h1>
<p>Helianthemum ledifolium, commonly known as the creeping sandverbena, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate.</p>
