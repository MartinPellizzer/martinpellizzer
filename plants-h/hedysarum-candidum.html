                    <h1>Hedysarum candidum</h1>
<p>Hedysarum candidum, commonly known as white vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Hedysarum candidum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats.</p>
<p>It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native environments.</p>
