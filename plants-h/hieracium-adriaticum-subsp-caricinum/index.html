                            <h1>Hieracium Adriaticum Subsp. Caricinum</h1>
<p>Caricinum hawkweed, scientifically known as Hieracium adriaticum subsp. caricinum, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the daisy family, Asteraceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and hairy leaves. This subspecies is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this unique plant from habitat loss and invasive species.</p>
