                    <h1>Hieracium × subhyperdoxum</h1>
<p>Hieracium × subhyperdoxum, commonly known as the hybrid dandelion, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is a natural hybrid between Hieracium pilosellum and Hieracium auripigmentum, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parents. The plant typically grows in meadows and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It produces yellow composite flowers that develop into fluffy white seed heads, which are characteristic of the dandelion genus.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits variability in morphology and is often found in regions where its parent species overlap.</p>
