<p>Hydrophyllum cochinchinense, commonly known as the Vietnamese water shield, is a semi-aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has floating leaves that are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its small, white flowers bloom in clusters and are often pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The roots help stabilize the soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
