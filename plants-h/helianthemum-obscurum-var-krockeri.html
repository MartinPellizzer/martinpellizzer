                    <h1>Helianthemum obscurum var. krockeri</h1>
<p>Helianthemum obscurum var. krockeri, commonly known as the dark rock rose, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features small, evergreen leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and as a ground cover in Mediterranean climates.</p>
