                    <h1>Hicriopteris laevissima</h1>
<p>Hicriopteris laevissima, commonly known as the smooth fronded water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 10â€“30 cm long. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it anchors itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thin, waxy layer that helps it retain moisture.</p>
<p>The plant plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration.</p>
