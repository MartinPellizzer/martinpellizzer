                    <h1>Hapalorchis</h1>
<p>Hapalorchis, commonly known as the freshwater snail, is a genus of small, freshwater gastropods belonging to the family Lymnaeidae.</p>
<p>These snails are characterized by their simple, spiral-shaped shells and are typically found in ponds, streams, and lakes. They play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by grazing on algae and detritus. Hapalorchis species are often hosts to various trematode parasites, which can have significant impacts on their health and the broader ecosystem.</p>
<p>Their presence is often used as an indicator of water quality in freshwater habitats.</p>
