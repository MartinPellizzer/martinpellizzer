                    <h1>Hoya parasitica var. geoffrayi</h1>
<p>Hoya parasitica var. geoffrayi, commonly known as the parasitic hoya, is a unique species within the Asclepiadaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from a host plant while also performing photosynthesis. The plant typically grows as a vine, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are clustered in umbels and are usually white or pale pink, with a distinctive waxy appearance.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it is often found growing on other plants in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
