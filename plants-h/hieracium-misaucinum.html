<p>Hieracium misaucinum, commonly known as the lesser hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Hieracium misaucinum is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit.</p>
