                    <h1>Habenaria roemeriana</h1>
<p>Habenaria roemeriana, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces delicate, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air circulation.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as endangered in many states.</p>
