                    <h1>Hoya angustifolia</h1>
<p>Hoya angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf waxplant, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of star-shaped, waxy white flowers. The plant produces a sweet, fragrant nectar that attracts pollinators like bees and moths. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Hoya angustifolia is popular among houseplants due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
