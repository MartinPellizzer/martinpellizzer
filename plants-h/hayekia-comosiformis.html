                    <h1>Hayekia comosiformis</h1>
<p>Hayekia comosiformis, commonly known as the silky broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on species of Astragalus. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a dense, branched cluster, and its stems are covered in fine, silky hairs. It is known for its unique reproductive strategy, where it forms specialized structures called haustoria to attach to its host.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized lifestyle, it is considered a rare and poorly understood species within the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
