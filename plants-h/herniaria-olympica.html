                    <h1>Herniaria olympica</h1>
<p>Herniaria olympica, commonly known as the Olympic bladderwrack, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the coastal areas of southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Haloglossaceae and is characterized by its small, green, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt. The plant thrives in saline environments, such as rocky shores and salt marshes, where it tolerates high levels of salinity and exposure to wind and waves. Its structure is adapted for water retention, with thick, fleshy leaves that help it survive in harsh, arid coastal conditions.</p>
<p>Herniaria olympica plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
