<p>Hippuris vulgaris var. ramificans, commonly known as the branched water-plantain, is a aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often submerged, with the upper portion sometimes emergent. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, appearing in clusters near the water's surface.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its branching stems, which give it its scientific name.</p>
