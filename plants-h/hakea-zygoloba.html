<p>Hakea zygoloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces cylindrical, red or pink flower spikes that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody structure and ability to thrive in dry, sandy soils make it well adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Hakea zygoloba is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.</p>
