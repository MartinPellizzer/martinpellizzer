<p>Herniaria fruticosa subsp.</p>
<p>erecta, commonly known as the upright bladderwort, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. It features small, fleshy, greenish-blue leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is native to rocky and sandy soils in Mediterranean regions and thrives in full sun.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in its native habitat.</p>
