<p>Hieracium chlorifolium subsp.</p>
<p>isoplates, commonly known as the broadleaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of broadly ovate, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers in a flat-topped inflorescence, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its leaves and flowers are covered in dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss and protect against herbivory.</p>
