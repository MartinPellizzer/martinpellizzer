<p>Hieracium holopetalum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>

The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow flowers with ray florets.

<p>Due to its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
