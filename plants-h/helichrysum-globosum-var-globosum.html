<p>Helichrysum globosum var. globosum, commonly known as the Globe everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>

It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to retain color for extended periods.</p>
