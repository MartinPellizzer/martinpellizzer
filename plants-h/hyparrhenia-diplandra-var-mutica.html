                    <h1>Hyparrhenia diplandra var. mutica</h1>
<p>Hyparrhenia diplandra var. mutica, commonly known as the African grass or red grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically reddish in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and savannas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and rapid growth, it is sometimes used for erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock.</p>
