<p>Howellia aquatilis, commonly known as the aquatic willow, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, branching stems that often grow along the surface of water or in moist soil. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a smooth surface and a slightly hairy underside.</p>
<p>Howellia aquatilis plays an important role in stabilizing shoreline sediments and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
