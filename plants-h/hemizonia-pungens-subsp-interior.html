<p>Hemizonia pungens subsp.</p>
<p>interior, commonly known as the interior prickly pear, is a cacti species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, paddle-shaped stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, which are followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to drought conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance.</p>
