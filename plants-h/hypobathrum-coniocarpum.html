<p>Hypobathrum coniocarpum, commonly known as the yellow star orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers with a star-like appearance, which bloom during the warmer months. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>The orchid's botanical features make it a unique and visually striking addition to the flora of its native habitat.</p>
