<p>Humboltia fuegi, commonly known as the Magellan's tree or the Chilean rosewood, is a flowering plant native to southern Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its large, showy white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a woody stem and produces small, round, red fruits that contain one or two seeds.
