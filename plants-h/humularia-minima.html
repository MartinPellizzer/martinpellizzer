                    <h1>Humularia minima</h1>
<p>Humularia minima, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Humularia minima thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in the wild.</p>
