                    <h1>Hieracium vulgatum var. hepaticum</h1>
<p>Hieracium vulgatum var. hepaticum, commonly known as the liverworts, is a type of non-vascular plant that belongs to the family Hepaticaceae.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a simple structure with a thallus, which is a leaf-like body that lacks true roots, stems, and leaves. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its growth is often slow and dependent on humid conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is characterized by its small, lobed leaves and is often found in association with other mosses and lichens.</p>
