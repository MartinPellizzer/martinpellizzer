                    <h1>Habrothamnus villosus</h1>
<p>Habrothamnus villosus, commonly known as the hairy broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its dependence on host plants such as grasses and forbs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be a problematic weed in agricultural settings.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants.</p>
