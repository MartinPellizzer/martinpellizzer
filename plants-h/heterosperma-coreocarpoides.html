<p>It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, branching stems with small, opposite leaves that are often submerged or floating.

<p>The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in aquatic environments.</p>
