<p>Harmsia lepidota, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale green flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Harmsia lepidota is typically found in moist, shady environments such as forests and along stream banks.</p>
<p>It is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils.</p>
