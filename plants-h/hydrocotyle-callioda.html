<p>Hydrocotyle callioda, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water shield, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It features small, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, arranged in a rosette at the water's surface. The plant produces small white flowers with five petals, which bloom from June to September. Its roots are adapted to anchor in muddy substrates, and it often grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and wetlands.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle callioda plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for invertebrates and young fish.</p>
