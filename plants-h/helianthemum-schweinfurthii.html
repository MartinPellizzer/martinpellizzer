<p>Helianthemum schweinfurthii, commonly known as the rock rose, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub with woody stems that often form dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically small, oval, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Helianthemum schweinfurthii is adapted to coastal and Mediterranean climates, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils.</p>
