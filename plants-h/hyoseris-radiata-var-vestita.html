                    <h1>Hyoseris radiata var. vestita</h1>
<p>Hyoseris radiata var. vestita, commonly known as the white dandelion, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that develop into white, puffy seeds. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. Its hairy leaves and stems help reduce water loss, adapting it to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>The white seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution.</p>
