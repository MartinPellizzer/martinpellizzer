<p>Harrisia fernowii, commonly known as the Mexican nightshade, is a species of cactus native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of small, fleshy fruits that ripen to a deep red color. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils.</p>
<p>The fruit is edible when ripe, though it contains solanine, which can be toxic in large quantities.</p>
