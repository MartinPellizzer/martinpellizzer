<p>Haplopappus pinifolius, commonly known as the needleleaf pappus, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and woolly, silvery foliage. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as sagebrush steppe and rocky slopes. Its leaves are needle-like, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions, and it produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
