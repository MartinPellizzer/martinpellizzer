                    <h1>Haworthia magnifica var. magnifica</h1>
<p>Haworthia magnifica var. magnifica, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features distinctive, upright rosettes of fleshy, triangular leaves with white to light green markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The leaves are covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina, which helps reduce water loss. It produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, white or pale green flowers during the summer months.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires minimal watering, making it well-suited for indoor cultivation.</p>
