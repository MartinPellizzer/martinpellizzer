                    <h1>Herrickia glauca</h1>
<p>Herrickia glauca, commonly known as the blue-green mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that primarily grows on the branches of its host trees.</p>
<p>It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or pale green flowers that are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous appearance. Its berries, which are typically yellow or red, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Herrickia glauca plays a unique role in its ecosystem by relying on both its host and animal pollinators for survival.</p>
