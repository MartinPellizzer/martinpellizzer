<p>Heliotropium argenteum, commonly known as silver heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or violet flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Heliotropium argenteum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.</p>
