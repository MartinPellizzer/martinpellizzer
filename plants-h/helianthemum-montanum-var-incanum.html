                    <h1>Helianthemum montanum var. incanum</h1>
<p>Helianthemum montanum var. incanum, commonly known as the silver sandmat, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal.</p>
