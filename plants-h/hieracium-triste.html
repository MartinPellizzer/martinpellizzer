<p>Hieracium triste, commonly known as the weeping hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, alternate leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine pubescence. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it can outcompete native vegetation if not managed carefully.</p>
