<p>Hedysarum hedysaroides, commonly known as the yellow peavine, is a perennial legume native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its climbing habit, trifoliate leaves, and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, elliptical pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Hedysarum hedysaroides plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
