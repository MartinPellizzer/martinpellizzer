<p>Hieracium caesium subsp.</p>
<p>volakanum, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and ragworts.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
