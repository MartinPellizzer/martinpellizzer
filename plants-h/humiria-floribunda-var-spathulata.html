                    <h1>Humiria floribunda var. spathulata</h1>
<p>Humiria floribunda var. spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leafed humiria, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its humid, tropical habitat. The plant produces showy, spathaceous flowers that are typically pale green or yellow, surrounded by a leaf-like bract. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.</p>
