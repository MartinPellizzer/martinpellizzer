<p>Hieracium murorum subsp.</p>
<p>ocriodes, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides.</p>
<p>The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are broadly ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a rough, hairy texture. Its flowering stems rise from the center of the rosette, bearing yellow composite flowers that attract pollinators.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it an aggressive colonizer in suitable habitats.</p>
