                    <h1>Hieracium incertum</h1>
<p>Hieracium incertum, commonly known as the uncertain hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, and its leaves are usually lance-shaped with rough textures. It has a creeping growth habit, often forming dense mats that can dominate certain habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its variable morphology, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish from other hawkweed species.</p>
