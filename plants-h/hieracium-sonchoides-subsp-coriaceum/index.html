                            <h1>Hieracium Sonchoides Subsp. Coriaceum</h1>
<p>Hieracium sonchoides subsp. coriaceum is a lesser-known member of the daisy family known for its distinctive appearance and ecological significance. This subspecies is characterized by its hairy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring and early summer. It thrives in open habitats such as meadows and disturbed soils, often found in temperate regions across Europe and parts of Asia. Despite its modest size, it plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining biodiversity. Its unique features make it a fascinating subject for botanists and nature enthusiasts alike.</p>
