<p>Hieracium incanescens, commonly known as the hoary hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray leaves and yellow daisy-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are covered in fine white hairs, which give it a frosty appearance, and it produces achenes (small, dry fruits) that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Hieracium incanescens is also known for its ability to spread aggressively, making it a potential weed in certain environments.</p>
