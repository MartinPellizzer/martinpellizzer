<p>Haplopappus tenuisectus, commonly known as the slenderleaf hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous root system. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed soils and has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small yellow flowers bloom in clusters and are followed by bracts that form a pappus, aiding in wind dispersal of its seeds.</p>
<p>Haplopappus tenuisectus is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low moisture and high sunlight exposure.</p>
