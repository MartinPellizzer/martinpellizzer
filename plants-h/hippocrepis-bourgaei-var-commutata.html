                    <h1>Hippocrepis bourgaei var. commutata</h1>
<p>Hippocrepis bourgaei var. commutata, commonly known as the commutated thyme-leafed orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in shades of pink and white. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a fine, fuzzy layer, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
