<p>Hornungia alpina subsp.</p>
<p>brevicaulis, commonly known as the short-stemmed alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It typically forms dense mats of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often blooming in late summer. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure reflects its evolutionary response to cold climates and limited growing seasons.</p>
