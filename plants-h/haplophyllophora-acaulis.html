                    <h1>Haplophyllophora acaulis</h1>
<p>Haplophyllophora acaulis, commonly known as the dwarf moss, is a small, non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having structures called rhizoids for anchoring and water absorption. Its spores are produced in capsules that are typically clustered on the plant's surface.</p>
<p>Haplophyllophora acaulis is often found in rocky or soil-covered areas, contributing to soil stabilization and moisture retention.</p>
