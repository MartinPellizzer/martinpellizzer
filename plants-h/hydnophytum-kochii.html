<p>Hydnophytum kochii, commonly known as the sticky vine or epiphytic bladderwort, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its small, sticky leaves that help it adhere to surfaces. It produces tiny flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences.</p>
<p>Hydnophytum kochii is also known for its unique ability to trap small insects, which it uses as a nutrient source.</p>
