                    <h1>Hapalorchis pandurata</h1>
<p>Hapalorchis pandurata, commonly known as the liver fluke, is a parasitic flatworm belonging to the family Fasciolidae.</p>
<p>It is primarily found in the bile ducts of its host, which includes various species of mammals, birds, and occasionally reptiles. The adult fluke has a distinctive shape, resembling a leaf or a liver, hence its common name. Its life cycle involves a complex interaction with intermediate hosts, such as snails, and requires a definitive host for reproduction.</p>
<p>Botanically, while not a plant, it is often studied in the context of parasitology due to its ecological and medical significance.</p>
