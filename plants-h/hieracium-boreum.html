                    <h1>Hieracium boreum</h1>
<p>Hieracium boreum, commonly known as the Arctic hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb with a rosette of basal leaves and tall, slender stems that bear yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats where it can tolerate cold temperatures and strong winds. Its leaves are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Hieracium boreum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native ecosystems and provides nectar for pollinators.</p>
