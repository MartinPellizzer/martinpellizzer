<p>Hoarea erythrophylla, commonly known as the red-flowered ironwood, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of bright red flowers, which are a striking feature and attract various pollinators. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater.</p>
<p>Hoarea erythrophylla is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
