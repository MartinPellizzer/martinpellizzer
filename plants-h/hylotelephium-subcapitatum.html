                    <h1>Hylotelephium subcapitatum</h1>
<p>Hylotelephium subcapitatum, commonly known as the purple stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, gray-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces vibrant purple or pink flowers in late summer, which are borne on tall, branching stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid climates.</p>
