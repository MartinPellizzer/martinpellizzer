                    <h1>Haworthia limifolia f. pimentellii</h1>
<p>Haworthia limifolia f. pimentellii, commonly known as the Pimentel's narrow-leafed Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that are typically green with white or pale markings. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped white flowers during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
