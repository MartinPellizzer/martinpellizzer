<p>Holcus borealis var. biflorus, commonly known as the northern basket grass, is a perennial grass species native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows, bogs, and stream sides. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often tinged with purple or red. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Holcus borealis var. biflorus is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance.</p>
