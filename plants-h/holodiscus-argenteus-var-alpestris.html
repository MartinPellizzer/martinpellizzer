                    <h1>Holodiscus argenteus var. alpestris</h1>
<p>Holodiscus argenteus var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine silverweed, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-white, woolly leaves that help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and alpine tundra.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate cold climates.</p>
