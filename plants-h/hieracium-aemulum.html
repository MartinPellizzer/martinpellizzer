<p>Hieracium aemulum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with a distinctive central disk, and its leaves are typically basal, forming a rosette. Hieracium aemulum is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry conditions.</p>
<p>It is an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation due to its rapid growth and prolific seed production.</p>
