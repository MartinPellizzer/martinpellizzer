                    <h1>Helophytum fluitans</h1>
<p>Helophytum fluitans, commonly known as the floating stonecrop, is a unique succulent that thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, water-storing leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that can range from white to pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread across the water's surface, forming dense mats.</p>
<p>Helophytum fluitans is adapted to fluctuating water levels, making it a resilient plant in wetland ecosystems.</p>
