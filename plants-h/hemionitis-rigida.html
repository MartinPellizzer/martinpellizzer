<p>Hemionitis rigida, commonly known as the rigid hemionitis, is a rare and delicate fern native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. It reproduces via spores and is typically found in association with other xerophytic plants.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
