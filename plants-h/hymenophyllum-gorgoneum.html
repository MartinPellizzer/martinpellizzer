                    <h1>Hymenophyllum gorgoneum</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum gorgoneum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a delicate epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, soft, and velvety fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which give it a distinctive appearance and help retain moisture.</p>
<p>The spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
