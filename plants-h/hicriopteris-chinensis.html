<p>Hicriopteris chinensis, commonly known as Chinese water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>

The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and rice paddies. Its roots are adapted for anchoring in soft substrates, and it plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients.</p>
