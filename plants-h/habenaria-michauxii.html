                    <h1>Habenaria michauxii</h1>
<p>Habenaria michauxii, commonly known as the Michaux's butterfly orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and woodlands, where it can access the necessary humidity and light for photosynthesis. The plant produces striking, butterfly-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which are often fragrant to attract pollinators. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil, while its rhizomes help in vegetative propagation.</p>
<p>The species is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local pollinator populations.</p>
