<p>Humata perpusilla, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on various coniferous trees.</p>
<p>It produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant relies on its host for nutrients and water, forming a symbiotic relationship. Its berries are bright red and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing tree growth and biodiversity.</p>
