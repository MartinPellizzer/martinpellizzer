<p>It is a member of the Ericaceae family, characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and preference for cool, moist environments. The plant features narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. Its small, bell-shaped flowers are typically pink or purple and bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its resilience to extreme cold and its role in stabilizing soil in alpine and tundra ecosystems.</p>
