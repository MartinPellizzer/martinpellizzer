<p>Hieracium amplexicaule subsp.</p>
<p>speluncarum, commonly known as the cave dandelion, is a rare and specialized plant species adapted to grow in dark, humid environments such as caves and rock crevices. It is characterized by its pale green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in low-light conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically hidden from view due to its subterranean habitat. It relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is crucial for its survival in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
