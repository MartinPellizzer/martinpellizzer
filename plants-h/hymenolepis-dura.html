<p>Hymenolepis dura, commonly known as the hardy water clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas.</p>
<p>It features a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread across the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender stalks. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a waxy surface, helping to repel water.</p>
<p>Hymenolepis dura is known for its adaptability to moist environments and its role in stabilizing soil in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
