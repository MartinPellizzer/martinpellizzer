                    <h1>Hoarea strigosa</h1>
<p>Hoarea strigosa, commonly known as the woolly hakea, is a perennial shrub native to southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding insects. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to poor, sandy soils, allowing it to thrive in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Hoarea strigosa is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
