                    <h1>Hypericum longistylum var. giraldii</h1>
<p>Hypericum longistylum var. giraldii, commonly known as the long-stemmed St. John's wort, is a variant of the St. John's wort genus native to North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, elongated stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has small, opposite leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its medicinal properties are similar to other Hypericum species, though it is less commonly used in traditional herbal remedies.</p>
<p>The varietal distinction is based on subtle differences in stem length and floral structure compared to the typical form of Hypericum longistylum.</p>
