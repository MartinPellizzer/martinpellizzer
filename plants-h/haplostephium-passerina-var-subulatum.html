                    <h1>Haplostephium passerina var. subulatum</h1>
<p>Haplostephium passerina var. subulatum, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and rocky habitats in western North America.</p>
<p>It features small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which are often borne on short, erect stems. It is adapted to well-drained soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>This variety is noted for its compact growth habit and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
