<p>Hieracium pilosella subsp.</p>
<p>euronotum, commonly known as the European mouse-ear hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy, low-growing stature and clusters of small yellow flowers.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically basal, spoon-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>This subspecies is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native flora.</p>
