                    <h1>Halothamnus glaucus</h1>
<p>Halothamnus glaucus, commonly known as the silver sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, wax-like hairs that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle floral display to its habitat. It is well adapted to poor, rocky soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>Halothamnus glaucus plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert-dwelling species.</p>
