<p>Hieracium argyrocomum, commonly known as silverleaf hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant features hairy, silver-tomentose leaves that give it its common name, and its flowers are typically yellow with a central disk. It thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas.</p>
