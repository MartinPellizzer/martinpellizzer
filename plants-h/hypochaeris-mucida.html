                    <h1>Hypochaeris mucida</h1>
<p>Hypochaeris mucida, commonly known as the sticky weed or yellow starbursts, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. The plant produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Its leaves are usually hairy and have a somewhat sticky texture, which helps in reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Hypochaeris mucida is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, where it thrives in full sun.</p>
