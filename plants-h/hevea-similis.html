                    <h1>Hevea similis</h1>
<p>Hevea similis, commonly known as the rubber vine, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its climbing habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. Its latex sap, similar to that of the rubber tree, has been used traditionally for various purposes.</p>
<p>However, it is less commercially significant than Hevea brasiliensis.</p>
