<p>Hydnophytum formicarum subsp.</p>
<p>siamense, commonly known as the ant plant, is a tropical epiphytic shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring specialized structures called domatia that provide shelter for symbiotic ants.</p>
<p>These ants, primarily species of the genus Pheidole, reside within the plant's hollow stems and protect it from herbivores in exchange for shelter and food. The plant's growth is closely intertwined with its ant inhabitants, forming a mutualistic relationship essential for its survival.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its role as a model system for studying plant-ant interactions and tropical ecosystem dynamics.</p>
