                    <h1>Hillia parasitica</h1>
<p>Hillia parasitica, commonly known as the mistletoe of the genus Hillia, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the stems of other plants, primarily in the family Rubiaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using limited chlorophyll. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in shaded environments.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure includes a woody stem and small, scale-like leaves that are adapted for parasitic growth.</p>
