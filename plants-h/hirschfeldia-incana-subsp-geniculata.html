<p>Hirschfeldia incana subsp.</p>
<p>geniculata, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and hairy, gray-green foliage that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates.</p>
<p>Its morphology reflects evolutionary adaptations to survive in harsh, desert environments.</p>
