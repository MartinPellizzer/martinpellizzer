<p>Hemionitis duthiei, commonly known as the Duthie's hemionitis, is a rare and specialized fern species native to arid regions of western China.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to extreme environmental conditions. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it conserve moisture. Its fronds are typically short and narrow, with a distinctive appearance that sets it apart from other ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
