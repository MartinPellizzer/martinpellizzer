                    <h1>Hoffmannia formicaria</h1>
<p>Hoffmannia formicaria, commonly known as the ant plant, is a unique epiphytic species native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its ability to secrete a sticky substance that attracts ants, which in turn provide protection against herbivores. The plant's structure includes specialized structures called domatia, which serve as shelters for the ants. These domatia are typically found on the stems and leaves, creating a symbiotic relationship between the plant and the ants.</p>
<p>Hoffmannia formicaria is also notable for its small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink.</p>
