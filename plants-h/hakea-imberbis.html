                    <h1>Hakea imberbis</h1>
<p>Hakea imberbis, commonly known as the spinifex hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage that forms a compact, mat-like structure. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in cylindrical spikes. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Hakea imberbis is adapted to sandy soils and is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardy nature.</p>
