                <h1>Hypopterygiopsis scabrida</h1>
<p>Hypopterygiopsis scabrida, commonly known as the rough hypopterygiopsis, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
