<p>Hedysarum divergens, commonly known as the broadleaf peavine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its distinctive pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands.</p>
<p>Hedysarum divergens plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
