<p>Heterozeuxine argentea, commonly known as silverleaf saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray leaves, which are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous or tundra habitats.</p>
<p>Heterozeuxine argentea is a low-growing perennial that plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh native environment.</p>
