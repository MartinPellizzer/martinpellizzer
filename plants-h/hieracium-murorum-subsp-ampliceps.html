<p>Hieracium murorum subsp.</p>
<p>ampliceps, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a rough, serrated edge, and they are often covered in fine hairs.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows.</p>
