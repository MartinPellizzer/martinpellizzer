                    <h1>Hypocalyptus</h1>
<p>Hypocalyptus, commonly known as the white sand lichen, is a unique type of lichen that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. The plant forms a crust-like structure on rocks and soil, helping it to retain moisture in harsh conditions. Its slow growth rate makes it an indicator species for stable, undisturbed ecosystems.</p>
<p>Hypocalyptus plays a crucial role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its native habitats.</p>
