<p>Heliocauta atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the western Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy yellow-orange flowers that open in response to sunlight. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty, windy conditions.</p>
