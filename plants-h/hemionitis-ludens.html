                    <h1>Hemionitis ludens</h1>
<p>Hemionitis ludens, commonly known as the mountain holly or ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and other mountainous regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, clustered growth habit and its unique, delicate fronds that resemble those of a holly plant. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine soils. Its reproductive structures, including spores, are produced on the undersides of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Hemionitis ludens is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
