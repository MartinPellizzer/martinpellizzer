                    <h1>Hapaloceras arupa</h1>
<p>Hapaloceras arupa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a rare and endangered tree species native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark red heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making it particularly vulnerable to deforestation. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical, while its flowers are small and greenish-white.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and overexploitation, Hapaloceras arupa is critically endangered, prompting conservation efforts to protect this unique botanical species.</p>
