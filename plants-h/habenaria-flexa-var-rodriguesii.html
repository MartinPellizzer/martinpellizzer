                    <h1>Habenaria flexa var. rodriguesii</h1>
<p>Habenaria flexa var. rodriguesii, commonly known as Rodrigues's ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the island of Rodrigues in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, pale green to yellowish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, exhibiting an epiphytic habit, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, rather than from soil.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, facing threats from habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
