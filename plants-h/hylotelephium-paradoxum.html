                    <h1>Hylotelephium paradoxum</h1>
<p>Hylotelephium paradoxum, commonly known as the Armenian carpet or autumn sedum, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or orange, typically in late summer to early autumn. It forms dense mats or cushions, often carpeting rocky slopes and dry meadows.</p>
<p>Hylotelelephium paradoxum is popular in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value.</p>
