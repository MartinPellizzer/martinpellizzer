                <h1>Hemigraphis reptans</h1>
<p>Hemigraphis reptans, commonly known as shining moss or Mexican ice plant, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It features dense, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread easily along the ground. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with a fine, silvery or bluish-white powdery coating, which gives the plant its characteristic "shining" appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of pink or white, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems.</p>
<p>This plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to form dense ground covers.</p>
