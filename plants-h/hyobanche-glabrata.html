                    <h1>Hyobanche glabrata</h1>
<p>Hyobanche glabrata, commonly known as the naked stem morning glory, is a parasitic plant belonging to the family Convolvulaceae.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of other plants. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Its seeds are small and often dispersed by wind or animals.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively affect the growth of its host plants.</p>
