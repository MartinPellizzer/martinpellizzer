<p>Hymenophyllum assurgens, commonly known as the silver fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds with closely spaced, overlapping pinnae. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its fronds are covered in a fine layer of trichomes, giving them a silvery appearance.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum assurgens is known for its unique reproductive structures, including small, spore-producing sorus clusters on the underside of its leaves.</p>
