                    <h1>Hordeum hystrix</h1>
<p>Hordeum hystrix, commonly known as the hairy barley, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and compact growth habit, which help it thrive in a variety of soil conditions. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered in dense inflorescences, with each spikelet containing two to three bracts. Hordeum hystrix is typically found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural settings.</p>
