<p>Hexonix arisanensis, commonly known as the Arisan hexonix, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Taiwan.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hexonix arisanensis is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
