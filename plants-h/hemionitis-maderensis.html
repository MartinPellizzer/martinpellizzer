                    <h1>Hemionitis maderensis</h1>
<p>Hemionitis maderensis, commonly known as the Mader's hemionitis, is a rare and specialized fern native to the island of Madeira.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically green with a slight bluish tint. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemionitis maderensis is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
