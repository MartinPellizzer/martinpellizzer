                    <h1>Herniaria arenicola</h1>
<p>Herniaria arenicola, commonly known as sand-herniaria, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in sandy and coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a delicate touch to its habitat. It is well-adapted to harsh coastal climates, with a deep root system that anchors it in unstable sand.</p>
<p>Herniaria arenicola plays a role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local biodiversity in its native range.</p>
