<p>Hesperomannia arborescens subsp.</p>
<p>swezeyi, commonly known as the coastal hesperomannia, is a rare shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. It plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
