<p>Hieracium chromolepium, commonly known as the violet false dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and its yellowish-green flowers that resemble those of the common dandelion. Native to Europe, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides. The plant produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies.</p>
