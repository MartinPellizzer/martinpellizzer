                    <h1>Hemionitis grayi</h1>
<p>Hemionitis grayi, commonly known as the gray's hemionitis, is a rare and unique fern species native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, creeping rhizomes and small, clustered fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, semi-desert environments. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing capsules, are typically found on the underside of its fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Hemionitis grayi is considered a sensitive indicator species for ecological health.</p>
