<p>Hymenoclea salsola, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is an annual flowering plant native to Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, bract-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is highly adaptable, thriving in arid and saline environments due to its succulent stems and deep root system. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in agricultural fields.</p>
<p>Hymenoclea salsola is considered a weed in many regions but plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock.</p>
