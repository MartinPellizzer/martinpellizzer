                    <h1>Humblotiella</h1>
<p>Humblotiella, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for photosynthesis. The plant produces delicate, white or greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Humblotiella thrives in wet, shaded environments such as swamps and pine flatwoods.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts.</p>
