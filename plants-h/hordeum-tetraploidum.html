                    <h1>Hordeum tetraploidum</h1>
<p>Hordeum tetraploidum, commonly known as the tetraploid barley, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical spikelets and is typically found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. This plant belongs to the genus Hordeum, which includes several species of barley, and is notable for its tetraploid genome, meaning it has four sets of chromosomes. Hordeum tetraploidum is often used in agricultural research due to its genetic diversity and potential for hybridization with other barley species.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important subject in studies related to plant genetics and crop improvement.</p>
