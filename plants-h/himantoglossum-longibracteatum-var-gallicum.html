                    <h1>Himantoglossum longibracteatum var. gallicum</h1>
<p>Himantoglossum longibracteatum var. gallicum, commonly known as the French marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to wetland habitats in Europe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer, and its long, bract-like leaves that help it thrive in moist environments. The plant is typically found in peat bogs and fens, where it forms dense colonies. Its morphology includes a slender stem and a single, showy flower per stem, which is adapted for pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variety is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
