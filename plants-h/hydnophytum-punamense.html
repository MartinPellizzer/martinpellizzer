                    <h1>Hydnophytum punamense</h1>
<p>Hydnophytum punamense, commonly known as the Punam orchid vine, is a climbing plant native to the rainforests of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, where it attaches to tree trunks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, and it has specialized structures called hydathodes that help in water absorption.</p>
<p>Hydnophytum punamense is also notable for its ability to form symbiotic relationships with ants, which provide protection in exchange for shelter and food.</p>
