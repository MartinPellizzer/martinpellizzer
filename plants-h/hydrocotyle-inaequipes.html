<p>Hydrocotyle inaequipes, commonly known as the unequal-leaved water arum, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and striking spatulate inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as marshes and along stream banks. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat.</p>
<p>The flowers are usually greenish-white and are surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe.</p>
