<p>Helianthemum pilosum var. strictum, commonly known as the upright sandverbena, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has silver-gray foliage covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its more upright growth habit compared to other varieties of Helianthemum pilosum.</p>
