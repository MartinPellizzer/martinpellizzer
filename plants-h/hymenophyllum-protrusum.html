                    <h1>Hymenophyllum protrusum</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum protrusum, commonly known as the creeping toothed fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It features delicate, linear to lanceolate fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant's spores are produced in small, clustered sporangia located on the undersides of its fertile fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
