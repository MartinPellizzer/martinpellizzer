<p>Heteropappus noneifolius, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant has a low, spreading growth habit with silvery-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically yellow, and it produces fluffy, parachute-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>Heteropappus noneifolius is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and can tolerate extreme temperatures and limited water availability.</p>
