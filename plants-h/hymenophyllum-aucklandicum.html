<p>Hymenophyllum aucklandicum, commonly known as the Auckland haircap, is a small, delicate fern that belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, hair-like fronds that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or in dense forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>The plant is notable for its ability to retain moisture, which is essential for its survival in humid, tropical climates.</p>
