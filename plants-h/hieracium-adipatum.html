<p>Hieracium adipatum, commonly known as the fat hen or mouse ear hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, fleshy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to Europe, it has been introduced to other parts of the world and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant has a creeping growth habit and can form dense mats, which helps it spread easily.</p>
<p>It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
