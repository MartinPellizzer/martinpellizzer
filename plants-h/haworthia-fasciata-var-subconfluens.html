                    <h1>Haworthia fasciata var. subconfluens</h1>
<p>Haworthia fasciata var. subconfluens, commonly known as the Zulu bulb, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically pale green with distinct, narrow white or yellowish bands. The leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink during the spring or early summer.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance.</p>
