                    <h1>Heterocaryum × irregulare</h1>
<p>Heterocaryum × irregulare, commonly known as the irregular hybrid sycamore, is a naturally occurring hybrid between *Platanus occidentalis* (American sycamore) and *Platanus racemosa* (California sycamore).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its variable morphology, with features that blend those of both parent species, such as bark texture and leaf shape. The plant is typically found in riparian zones along rivers and streams in California. It exhibits a deciduous habit, shedding its leaves in the fall, and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring.</p>
<p>Due to its hybrid nature, it is often considered a botanical curiosity and is not widely cultivated.</p>
