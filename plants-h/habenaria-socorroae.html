                    <h1>Habenaria socorroae</h1>
<p>Habenaria socorroae, commonly known as Socorro's orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Socorro in the Revillagigedo archipelago.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its arid environment. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered together.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
