<p>Heliconia umbrophila, commonly known as the dark heliconia, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, brightly colored bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are broad and glossy, often with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture.</p>
<p>Heliconia umbrophila plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators such as hummingbirds and bats.</p>
