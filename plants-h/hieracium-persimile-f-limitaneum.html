<p>Hieracium persimile f. limitaneum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and leaves arranged in a basal rosette. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It produces yellow disk flowers surrounded by pale yellow to white ray florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
