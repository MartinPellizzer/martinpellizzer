                    <h1>Hippuris</h1>
<p>Hippuris, commonly known as water shield, is a semi-aquatic plant belonging to the family Hippuridaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in spikes, and it thrives in shallow, freshwater environments. Hippuris has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of wetland ecosystems.</p>
