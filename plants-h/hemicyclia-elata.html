<p>Hemicyclia elata, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemicyclia elata is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
