                    <h1>Hydnophytum albertisii</h1>
<p>Hydnophytum albertisii, commonly known as the Albert's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family.</p>
<p>It primarily inhabits the canopy of tropical rainforests, where it attaches to the branches of host trees such as Dipterocarps. The plant derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria, while also performing photosynthesis. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often pollinated by insects.</p>
<p>The species is notable for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity within forest ecosystems.</p>
