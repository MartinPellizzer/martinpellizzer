<p>Haptotrichion conicum, commonly known as the horned haptotrich, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its distinctive, horn-like structures on its stem.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Haptotrichionaceae and is primarily found in specific microhabitats with high humidity and acidic soil conditions. The plant's morphology includes a short, stout stem with clustered, small, greenish-yellow leaves. Its reproductive structures are specialized, featuring tiny, spore-producing capsules that are adapted for dispersal by wind.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Haptotrichion conicum is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
