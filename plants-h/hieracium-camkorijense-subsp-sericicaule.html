<p>Hieracium camkorijense subsp.</p>
<p>sericicaule, commonly known as the silky-hair hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves covered in fine, silky hairs, which give it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its subspecific distinction is based on morphological differences, particularly in leaf and flower structure.</p>
