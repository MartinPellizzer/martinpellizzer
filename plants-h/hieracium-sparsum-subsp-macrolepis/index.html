                            <h1>Hieracium Sparsum Subsp. Macrolepis</h1>
<p>Hieracium sparsum subsp. macrolepis is a lesser-known member of the daisy family known for its distinctive appearance and ecological significance. This plant is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers feature a yellow center surrounded by white petals. Despite its modest size, it plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining biodiversity. Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, this subspecies faces increasing threats to its survival.</p>
