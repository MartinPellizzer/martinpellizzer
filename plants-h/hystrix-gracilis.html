                    <h1>Hystrix gracilis</h1>
<p>Hystrix gracilis, commonly known as the slender porcupine plant, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with short, spiny stems and dense clusters of small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, which are borne on short, erect stalks. Its succulent leaves store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments.</p>
<p>Hystrix gracilis is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
