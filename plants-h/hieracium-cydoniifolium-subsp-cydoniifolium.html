<p>Hieracium cydoniifolium subsp.</p>
<p>cydoniifolium, commonly known as the cydoniifolium hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate to lanceolate leaves with a rough, hairy texture.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation.</p>
