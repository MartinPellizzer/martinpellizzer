<p>Hedysarum confertum, commonly known as the clustered vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Hedysarum confertum is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for pollinators.</p>
