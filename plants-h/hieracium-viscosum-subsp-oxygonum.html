<p>Hieracium viscosum subsp.</p>
<p>oxygonum, commonly known as the sticky hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, often sticky stems and leaves, which help in reducing water loss and deterring herbivores.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow composite flowers, typical of the Asteraceae family, which are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in leaf shape and flower structure.</p>
