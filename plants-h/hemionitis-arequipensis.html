                    <h1>Hemionitis arequipensis</h1>
<p>Hemionitis arequipensis, commonly known as the Arequipa hemionitis, is a rare and endangered fern native to the high-altitude regions of southern Peru.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to the extreme conditions of the Andean highlands. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of its leaves, a common feature in many fern species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is a subject of conservation interest and botanical study.</p>
