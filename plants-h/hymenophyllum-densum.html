<p>Hymenophyllum densum, commonly known as the dense moss fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of hair-like structures. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum densum plays an important ecological role in maintaining moisture and soil stability in its native habitats.</p>
