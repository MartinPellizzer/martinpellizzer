                    <h1>Hymenophyllum oligosorum</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum oligosorum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spore moss, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided leaves. The plant's spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in dense, hairy clusters on the underside of its leaves. Hymenophyllum oligosorum is typically found growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Its intricate morphology and specialized habitat make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
