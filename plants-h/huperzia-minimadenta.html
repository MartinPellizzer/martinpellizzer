<p>Huperzia minimadenta, commonly known as the small-leaf huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its sporophytes produce spores on the underside of the leaves, which are dispersed by wind to propagate the species.</p>
<p>Huperzia minimadenta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in shaded garden settings.</p>
