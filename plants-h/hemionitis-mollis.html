<p>Hemionitis mollis, commonly known as the silver hair fern, is a delicate, herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, soft, silvery-green fronds that give it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Hemionitis mollis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in humid, semi-shaded conditions.</p>
