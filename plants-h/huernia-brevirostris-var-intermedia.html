<p>Huernia brevirostris var. intermedia, commonly known as the Ghost Cactus, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>

The plant produces pale green to yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short, erect stems. Its leaves are small, spiny, and often shed as the plant matures, giving it a ghostly appearance.</p>
<p>It is well-suited for rock gardens and arid environments due to its drought tolerance and minimal care requirements.</p>
