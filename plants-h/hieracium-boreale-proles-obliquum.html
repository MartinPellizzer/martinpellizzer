                    <h1>Hieracium boreale proles obliquum</h1>
<p>Hieracium boreale proles obliquum, commonly known as the northern hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its upright, often hairy stems and yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, meadows, and forest edges. It has finely divided, lance-shaped leaves and produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats.</p>
