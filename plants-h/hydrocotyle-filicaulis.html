                    <h1>Hydrocotyle filicaulis</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle filicaulis, commonly known as the water pennywort, is a small aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and ditches. The plant has finely divided, feather-like leaves that float on the water surface, aiding in photosynthesis. Its roots help stabilize the sediment and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle filicaulis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits.</p>
