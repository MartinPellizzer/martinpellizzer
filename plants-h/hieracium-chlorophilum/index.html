                            <h1>Hieracium Chlorophilum</h1>
<p>Hieracium chlorophilum, also known as the green hawkweed, is a member of the sunflower family native to Europe and parts of Asia. This plant is characterized by its bright green leaves and yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it is considered invasive in some regions, outcompeting native flora. Its common name reflects its resemblance to hawks, with leaves that appear to be wings.</p>
