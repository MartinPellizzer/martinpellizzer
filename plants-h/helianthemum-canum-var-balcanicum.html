                    <h1>Helianthemum canum var. balcanicum</h1>
<p>Helianthemum canum var. balcanicum, commonly known as the Balkan sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<p>It features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its often arid or rocky habitat. It is well adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in limestone soils.</p>
<p>This variety is closely related to other species in the genus Helianthemum, which are commonly found in Mediterranean and temperate regions.</p>
