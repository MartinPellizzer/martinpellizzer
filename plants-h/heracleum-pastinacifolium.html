                    <h1>Heracleum pastinacifolium</h1>
<p>Heracleum pastinacifolium, commonly known as giant hogweed, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, umbrella-shaped compound leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant contains phototoxic sap that can cause severe skin irritation when exposed to sunlight. It is often found in moist, disturbed areas such as riverbanks and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions.</p>
