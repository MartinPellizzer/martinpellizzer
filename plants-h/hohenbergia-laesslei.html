                    <h1>Hohenbergia laesslei</h1>
<p>Hohenbergia laesslei, commonly known as the silver star bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of narrow, silver-white leaves that give it its distinctive appearance. The leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. It produces tall, branched inflorescences with showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the spring.</p>
<p>This plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance for low light and minimal water requirements.</p>
