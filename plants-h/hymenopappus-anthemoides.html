                    <h1>Hymenopappus anthemoides</h1>
<p>Hymenopappus anthemoides, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy, lobed leaves adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in a pappus, which aids in its propagation across dry landscapes. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife.</p>
