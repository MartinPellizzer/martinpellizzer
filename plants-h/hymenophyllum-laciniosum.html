<p>Hymenophyllum laciniosum, commonly known as the lace fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum laciniosum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in terrariums or as a houseplant.</p>
