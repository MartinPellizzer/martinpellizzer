<p>Herpestis vandellioides, commonly known as the dwarf sand-verbena, is a low-growing annual herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically reaches a height of less than 10 centimeters, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.</p>
