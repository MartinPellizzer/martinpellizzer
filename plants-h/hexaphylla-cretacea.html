                    <h1>Hexaphylla cretacea</h1>
<p>Hexaphylla cretacea, commonly known as the Cretaceous hexaphyll, is a fossil plant that provides important insights into ancient flora.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive six-lobed leaves, which are preserved in sedimentary rock layers from the Cretaceous period. The plant is believed to have been a type of cycad or early conifer, adapted to the warm, humid climates of the time. Its structure suggests it played a role in early terrestrial ecosystems, contributing to the development of modern plant communities.</p>
<p>Fossilized remains of Hexaphylla cretacea are often found in coastal sedimentary deposits, indicating its likely coastal or near-shore habitat.</p>
