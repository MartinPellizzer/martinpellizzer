<p>Hansemannia oblonga, commonly known as the Cape tulip, is a striking flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink blooms that resemble tulips, hence its common name. Hansemannia oblonga thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens in warm climates.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period, which can extend from late winter into spring.</p>
