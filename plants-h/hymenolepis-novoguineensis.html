<p>Hymenolepis novoguineensis, commonly known as the Guinea dwarf tapeworm, is a parasitic flatworm belonging to the family Hymenolepididae.</p>
<p>It is a small, segmented tapeworm that primarily infects rodents, particularly the Norway rat. The adult worm typically measures less than 2 centimeters in length and has a distinctive, flattened body with a scolex equipped with hooks and suckers. Its life cycle involves an intermediate host, such as a bean weevil, and a definitive host, like the rat.</p>
<p>The plant aspect is not applicable, as Hymenolepis novoguineensis is an animal parasite, not a botanical species.</p>
