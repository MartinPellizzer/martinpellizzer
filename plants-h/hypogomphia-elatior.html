                    <h1>Hypogomphia elatior</h1>
<p>Hypogomphia elatior, commonly known as the greater star lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, temperate environments.</p>
<p>It forms a flat, leaf-like structure with a distinctive star-shaped pattern on its upper surface. The thallus is typically pale yellow to orange, and it often grows on tree trunks, rocks, or soil in shaded areas. It is characterized by its ability to absorb moisture and nutrients from the environment through its symbiotic relationship with algae.</p>
<p>This lichen is an important indicator species for air quality and ecological health.</p>
