<p>Bluegrass, scientifically known as Helictotrichon hirtulum, is a hardy perennial grass native to North America. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in open fields, meadows, and along roadsides. This plant is valued for its fine texture, dense growth habit, and ability to withstand foot traffic. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion and makes it a popular choice for lawn and landscaping purposes. Despite its modest appearance, bluegrass plays a vital role in supporting local ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
