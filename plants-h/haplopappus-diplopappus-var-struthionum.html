                    <h1>Haplopappus diplopappus var. struthionum</h1>
<p>Haplopappus diplopappus var. struthionum, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing annual or biennial plant with a fibrous root system adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and beetles. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant's seeds are encased in a pappus, a feathery structure that aids in wind dispersal.</p>
