<p>Hudsonia ericoides subsp.</p>
<p>intermedia, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of California and Oregon. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of coastal environments, including salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>The plant features small, needle-like leaves and produces clusters of pink to reddish flowers in late spring to early summer. It is often found in maritime chaparral and dunes, contributing to the biodiversity of these unique ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species.</p>
