<p>Hechtia caerulea, commonly known as the blue hechtia, is a flowering plant native to Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are typically broad and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat.</p>
<p>Hechtia caerulea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements.</p>
