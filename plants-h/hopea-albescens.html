<p>Hopea albescens, commonly known as the white sand tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Dipterocarpaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds.
