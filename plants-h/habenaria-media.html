<p>Habenaria media, commonly known as the common spider orchid, is a species of orchid native to various regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, or purple. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in seasonal or semi-arid environments. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>The orchid's pollination is often facilitated by specific insect species, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitats.</p>
