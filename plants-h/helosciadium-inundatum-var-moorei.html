<p>Helosciadium inundatum var. moorei, commonly known as the Moore's water scurvygrass, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in South America.</p>
<p>It typically features small, alternate leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions. The plant produces tiny, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, which bloom during the wet season. It is often found in marshes, riverbanks, and other moist habitats where it can thrive in saturated soils.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range.</p>
