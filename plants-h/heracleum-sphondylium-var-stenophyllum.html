                    <h1>Heracleum sphondylium var. stenophyllum</h1>
<p>Heracleum sphondylium var. stenophyllum, commonly known as narrow-leaved hogweed, is a flowering plant in the carrot family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, umbrella-like inflorescence composed of small white or greenish-yellow flowers. The leaves are deeply lobed and can reach several feet in length, often with a distinctive, fuzzy texture. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
<p>However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
