<p>Heteropterys grisebachiana, commonly known as the gray-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows on the branches of host trees. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are usually covered in a dense, grayish pubescence, giving it its common name. Its flowers are small and clustered, often white or pale green, and it produces capsules as its fruit.</p>
<p>Heteropterys grisebachiana relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis.</p>
