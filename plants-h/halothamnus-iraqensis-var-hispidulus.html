                    <h1>Halothamnus iraqensis var. hispidulus</h1>
<p>Halothamnus iraqensis var. hispidulus, commonly known as the hairy halothamnus, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, wiry stems covered in fine, stiff hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often reduced to scales, a feature typical of xerophytic plants adapted to drought.</p>
<p>This species plays a role in stabilizing soil in degraded landscapes and is of interest in ecological restoration efforts.</p>
