                    <h1>Heliconia carajaensis</h1>
<p>Heliconia carajaensis, commonly known as the Caraj√°s heliconia, is a striking tropical plant native to the Amazon rainforest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Heliconiaceae family and is characterized by its large, brightly colored bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that are typically pollinated by birds and insects. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps, contributing to the lush undergrowth of its habitat.</p>
<p>Heliconia carajaensis is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
