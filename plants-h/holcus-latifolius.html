                    <h1>Holcus latifolius</h1>
<p>Holcus latifolius, commonly known as broadleaf quackgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its wide, flat leaves and tufted inflorescence that resembles a panicle. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, making it both a weed and a forage plant.</p>
<p>The flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its wide distribution.</p>
