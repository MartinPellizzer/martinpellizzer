<p>Hoya mindorensis subsp.</p>
<p>dinagatensis, commonly known as the Dinagat Waxplant, is a rare epiphytic species native to the Philippines. It features thick, fleshy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
