                    <h1>Herniaria erecta</h1>
<p>Herniaria erecta, commonly known as the rock scurfpea, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, arid environments and is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, bead-like fruits. It is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to withstand harsh, saline conditions.</p>
<p>Herniaria erecta is also known for its ability to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion in its natural habitat.</p>
