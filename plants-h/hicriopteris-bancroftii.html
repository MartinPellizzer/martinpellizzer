                    <h1>Hicriopteris bancroftii</h1>
<p>Hicriopteris bancroftii, commonly known as the Bancroft's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and often grows in clusters on rocky or humus-rich soil.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation in suitable climates.</p>
