                    <h1>Hicorius ovata var. ellipsoidalis</h1>
<p>Hicorius ovata var. ellipsoidalis, commonly known as the elliptical horned poppy, is a variant of the horned poppy species characterized by its elongated, ellipsoid-shaped seeds.</p>
<p>The plant is native to specific regions in southern Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Its most distinctive botanical feature is the unique, horn-like appendages on the seed pods, which aid in wind dispersal. The leaves are typically narrow and lanceolate, while the flowers are bright orange or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.</p>
