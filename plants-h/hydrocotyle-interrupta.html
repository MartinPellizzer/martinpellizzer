                    <h1>Hydrocotyle interrupta</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle interrupta, commonly known as the marsh mallow or water shield, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments.</p>
<p>It features floating leaves with a waxy surface that help reduce water loss, and its stems are often submerged or partially submerged. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, making it an important species in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle interrupta is also known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, contributing to its success in wetland habitats.</p>
