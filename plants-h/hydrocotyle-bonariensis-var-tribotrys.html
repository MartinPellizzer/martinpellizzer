                    <h1>Hydrocotyle bonariensis var. tribotrys</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle bonariensis var. tribotrys, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water pennywort, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It has small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in diameter, with a waxy surface that helps it float on water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often submerged, making it less noticeable compared to its foliage. It is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>This species is valued in aquariums for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
