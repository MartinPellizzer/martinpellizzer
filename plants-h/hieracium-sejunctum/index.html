<p>Hieracium sejunctum, also known as the clustered hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the daisy family, Asteraceae, and is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy stems. This plant often grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows and along roadsides. While it is not typically considered invasive, it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it a subject of interest for botanists and nature enthusiasts alike.</p>
