                    <h1>Hemitelia marginalis</h1>
<p>Hemitelia marginalis, commonly known as the coastal hemitelia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom during the cooler months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of salt-tolerant hairs, aiding in its adaptation to coastal environments.</p>
<p>Hemitelia marginalis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife.</p>
