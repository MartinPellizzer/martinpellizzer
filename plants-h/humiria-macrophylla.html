                    <h1>Humiria macrophylla</h1>
<p>Humiria macrophylla, commonly known as the broad-leaved marsh plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that are typically floating or semi-submerged, adapting to aquatic environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late summer. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in marshy areas, contributing to ecosystem health.</p>
<p>Humiria macrophylla is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and thrive in waterlogged conditions.</p>
