<p>Hypolepis setigera, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant.</p>
<p>The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.</p>
