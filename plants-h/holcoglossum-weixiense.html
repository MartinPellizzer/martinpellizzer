The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil, often growing on rocky substrates or in shaded forest areas. Its conservation status is critically endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection.</p>
<p>Holcoglossum weixiense plays an important role in the ecological balance of its native habitat and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
