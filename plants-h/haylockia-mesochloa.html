<p>Haylockia mesochloa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, featuring a single, waxy white flower that resembles a ghostly figure. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has a short, erect stem with a single leaf and is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
