<p>Heteropterys uribei, commonly known as the Urib√©'s mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees, drawing water and nutrients from them. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are usually arranged alternately along its stem. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its habitat.</p>
