<p>Henriettella rimosa, commonly known as the creeping sandverbena, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its small, pale blue to purple flowers bloom in summer, adding a delicate touch to its habitat.</p>
<p>Henriettella rimosa is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh desert climates.</p>
