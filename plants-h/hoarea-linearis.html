                    <h1>Hoarea linearis</h1>
<p>Hoarea linearis, commonly known as the slender horsetail, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Equisetaceae family, which includes other horsetails, and is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems and whorled leaves. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often found in stream banks and wet meadows. Its stems are covered in small, scale-like structures that reduce water loss, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds.</p>
<p>Hoarea linearis is a primitive plant with features reminiscent of early vascular plants, making it valuable for botanical studies.</p>
