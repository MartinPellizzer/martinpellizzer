                    <h1>Heliotropium repens</h1>
<p>Heliotropium repens, commonly known as creeping heliotrope, is a low-growing annual herb native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features prostrate or ascending stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or violet, with a distinctive scent reminiscent of heliotrope. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its overall appearance.</p>
<p>Heliotropium repens is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
