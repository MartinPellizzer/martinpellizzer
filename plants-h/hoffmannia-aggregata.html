<p>Hoffmannia aggregata, commonly known as the clustered hoffmannia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically produces clusters of bright red or orange flowers that attract pollinators such as birds and insects. Its leaves are usually opposite and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry environment.</p>
<p>Hoffmannia aggregata is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is well adapted to withstand periods of drought.</p>
