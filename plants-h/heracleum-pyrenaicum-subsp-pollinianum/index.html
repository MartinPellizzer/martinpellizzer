                            <h1>Heracleum Pyrenaicum Subsp. Pollinianum</h1>
<p>Giant hogweed, scientifically known as Heracleum pyrenaicum subsp. pollinianum, is a towering plant that can reach heights of over ten feet. Native to parts of Europe and Asia, it has become an invasive species in many regions across North America. Its large, umbrella-like leaves and showy white flowers make it visually striking, but its presence poses serious risks to human health. The plant's sap contains phototoxic compounds that can cause severe burns and blindness when exposed to sunlight. Due to its harmful effects, giant hogweed is often considered a dangerous weed that requires careful handling and management.</p>
