<p>Huperzia stricta, commonly known as the rigid huperzia, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, unbranched stems and small, scale-like leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Huperzia stricta is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its resistance to drought conditions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
