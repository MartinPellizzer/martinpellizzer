                    <h1>Haworthia picturata</h1>
<p>Haworthia picturata, commonly known as the picturata Haworthia, is a compact, evergreen succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense rosettes of fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically bluish-green with white or pale green markings. The leaves are covered in a fine, waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, white, star-shaped flowers on tall, slender stems during the summer months.</p>
<p>This plant is well-suited for rock gardens and container cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements.</p>
