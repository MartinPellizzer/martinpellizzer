<p>Haworthia hamata, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves that are pale green with distinctive white or yellow markings resembling a zebra's stripes. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers on tall, slender stems during the cooler months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
