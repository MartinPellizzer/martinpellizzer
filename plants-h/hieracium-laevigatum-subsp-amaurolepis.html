<p>Hieracium laevigatum subsp.</p>
<p>amaurolepis, commonly known as the pale-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, pale green leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the typical H. laevigatum, particularly in leaf coloration and flower structure.</p>
