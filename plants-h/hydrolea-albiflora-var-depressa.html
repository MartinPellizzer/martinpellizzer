<p>Hydrolea albiflora var. depressa, commonly known as the dwarf white-flowered hydrolea, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant features narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in regions with similar climates.</p>
