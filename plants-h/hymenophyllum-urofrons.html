<p>Hymenophyllum urofrons, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mistletoe, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in length. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on the bark of trees in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in small, cup-shaped structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum urofrons plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates.</p>
