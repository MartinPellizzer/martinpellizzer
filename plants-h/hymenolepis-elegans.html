                    <h1>Hymenolepis elegans</h1>
<p>Hymenolepis elegans, commonly known as the elegant tapeworm, is a parasitic flatworm belonging to the class Cyclophyllida.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, segmented body and a well-developed scolex with both hooks and suckers for attachment to the host's intestinal wall. The plant-like appearance of its body and the presence of a complex reproductive system are notable botanical features. It primarily infects rodents and can occasionally affect humans, making it a significant public health concern.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it does not have the typical botanical structures found in free-living plants.</p>
