                    <h1>Haworthia cymbiformis f. multifolia</h1>
<p>Haworthia cymbiformis f. multifolia, commonly known as the variegated Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with white or yellow variegation, giving it a striking appearance. The leaves are often adorned with small, translucent windows called "windows" that allow light to penetrate deeper into the plant. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers on tall, slender stems during the growing season.</p>
<p>This plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light.</p>
