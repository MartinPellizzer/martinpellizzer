                    <h1>Hymenophyllum hirtellum var. gratum</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum hirtellum var. gratum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leathery, and hairy fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
