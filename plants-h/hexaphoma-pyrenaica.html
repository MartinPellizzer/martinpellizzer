                    <h1>Hexaphoma pyrenaica</h1>
<p>Hexaphoma pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean leaf spot fungus, is a plant pathogen that primarily affects the leaves of certain woody plants.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pleosporaceae and is characterized by its ability to produce dark, circular spots on the foliage. The fungus overwinters in infected plant debris and spreads through spores released during wet weather. It thrives in humid conditions and can cause defoliation, weakening the host plant.</p>
<p>Management often involves removing infected plant parts and ensuring good air circulation around affected plants.</p>
