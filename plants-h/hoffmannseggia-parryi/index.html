It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, known for its distinctive leaf structures and ecological significance. This species is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often hairy foliage. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes. Conservation efforts are crucial to ensure its survival in the wild.</p>
