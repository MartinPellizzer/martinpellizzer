                    <h1>Hyparrhenia pusilla</h1>
<p>Hyparrhenia pusilla, commonly known as dwarf hairgrass, is a small, mat-forming grass native to Africa and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland environments.</p>
<p>Hyparrhenia pusilla is also used in some traditional practices and as a source of thatching in certain regions.</p>
