                    <h1>Hippion littorale</h1>
<p>Hippion littorale, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and spiny, silver-green leaves that help reduce water loss in salty environments. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to withstand strong winds and tidal conditions. Its flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Hippion littorale plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
