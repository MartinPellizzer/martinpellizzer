                    <h1>Hymenolepis canariensis</h1>
<p>Hymenolepis canariensis, commonly known as the Canary island flatworm, is a parasitic flatworm belonging to the class Turbellaria.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, flattened body and a distinctive pattern of longitudinal and transverse lines on its surface. This species primarily inhabits the skin and subcutaneous tissues of amphibians, particularly frogs, in tropical and subtropical regions. Its life cycle involves free-living intermediate hosts, such as snails and slugs, before reaching its final host.</p>
<p>The plant-like appearance of the worm has led to its common name, though it is not a true plant.</p>
