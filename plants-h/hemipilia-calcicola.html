<p>Hemipilia calcicola, commonly known as the limestone hemipilia, is a rare perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in rocky or limestone habitats. Its botanical features include lanceolate leaves and a unique floral structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemipilia calcicola is considered an endangered species.</p>
