                    <h1>Habenaria omissa</h1>
<p>Habenaria omissa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, white or pale green stems and its striking, fragrant flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, relying on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, as it lacks traditional roots. Its flowers are usually small, with three petals and three sepals, and they bloom in late summer or early fall.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and declining populations, Habenaria omissa is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
