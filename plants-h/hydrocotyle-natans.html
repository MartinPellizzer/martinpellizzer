                    <h1>Hydrocotyle natans</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle natans, commonly known as floating pennywort, is a semi-aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has small, heart-shaped leaves that float on the surface of water, with roots anchoring it to the substrate. The plant produces small white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the summer months. Its rapid growth rate makes it an invasive species in many freshwater ecosystems.</p>
<p>Botanically, it belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its ability to spread through both vegetative reproduction and seeds.</p>
