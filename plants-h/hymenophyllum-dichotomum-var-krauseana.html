                    <h1>Hymenophyllum dichotomum var. krauseana</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum dichotomum var. krauseana, commonly known as the Krause's filmy fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The fronds are usually divided into narrow, dichotomously branching segments, giving the plant its distinctive appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in forest understories.</p>
<p>The plant's spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
