<p>Hieracium krameri, commonly known as the meadow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and ragweed, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its yellow-orange flowers are surrounded by pale green bracts, and it produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Hieracium krameri is often considered a weed but can play a role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
