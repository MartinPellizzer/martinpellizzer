<p>Helianthemum thymifolium, commonly known as the thyme-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas.</p>
<p>Helianthemum thymifolium is drought-tolerant and has adapted to survive in harsh, arid environments.</p>
