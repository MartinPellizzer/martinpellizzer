                    <h1>Heterocentron subtriplinervium</h1>
<p>Heterocentron subtriplinervium, commonly known as the three-veined water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are divided into four lobes, each with a distinct venation pattern. The plant has a complex root system that helps it anchor in shallow water and absorb nutrients. Its reproductive structures include spore-producing sorus, which are typically located on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>This species is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, contributing to aquatic biodiversity.</p>
