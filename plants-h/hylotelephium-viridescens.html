<p>Hylotelephium viridescens, commonly known as the green stonecrop, is a perennial succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green or bluish-green, arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it store water and survive in arid conditions. The plant produces upright stems with clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple during the summer months. It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>Hylotelephium viridescens is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils.</p>
