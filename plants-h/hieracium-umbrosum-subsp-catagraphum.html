<p>Hieracium umbrosum subsp.</p>
<p>catagraphum, commonly known as the shadow hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, hairy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a robust root system that helps it thrive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, including variations in leaf shape and flower structure.</p>
