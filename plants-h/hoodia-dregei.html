                    <h1>Hoodia dregei</h1>
<p>Hoodia dregei, commonly known as the desert horned cactus, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and spiny, leaf-like structures that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Hoodia dregei is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems.</p>
<p>It is also known for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its efficacy.</p>
