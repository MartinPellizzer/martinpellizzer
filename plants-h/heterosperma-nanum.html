<p>Heterosperma nanum, commonly known as the dwarf water clover, is a small aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features delicate, floating leaves that are oval-shaped with a waxy surface, allowing it to thrive in still or slow-moving water. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are typically borne in clusters, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the substrate in aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Heterosperma nanum is often used in aquascaping due to its aesthetic value and ability to provide habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
