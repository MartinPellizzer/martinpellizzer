                    <h1>Hieracium confusum</h1>
<p>Hieracium confusum, commonly known as the confused hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the dandelion family (Compositae).</p>
<p>It is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy stems, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant typically grows to a height of 10â€“30 centimeters and produces small, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming invasive.</p>
<p>Due to its variability in appearance, it is often confused with other hawkweed species, hence its common name.</p>
