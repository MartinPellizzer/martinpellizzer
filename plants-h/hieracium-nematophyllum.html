<p>Hieracium nematophyllum, commonly known as the threadleaf hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and thread-like, giving it a distinctive appearance, while its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes.</p>
