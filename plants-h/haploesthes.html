<p>Haploesthes, commonly known as the false arum, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their striking, often colorful inflorescences that consist of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Haploesthes species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shaded environments. The genus includes several species, such as Haploesthes australis and Haploesthes kirkii, which are valued for their ornamental appeal.</p>
