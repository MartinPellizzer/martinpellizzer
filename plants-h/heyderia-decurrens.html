<p>Heyderia decurrens, commonly known as the creeping marsh grass, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in the Americas.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats that help stabilize the soil. Its small, greenish flowers appear in clusters and are pollinated by wind, contributing to its spread.</p>
<p>The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth surface and a slight sheen, adapting well to its aquatic surroundings.</p>
