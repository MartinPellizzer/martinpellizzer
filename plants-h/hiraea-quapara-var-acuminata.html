                    <h1>Hiraea quapara var. acuminata</h1>
<p>Hiraea quapara var. acuminata, commonly known as the sharp-pointed hiraea, is a rare and specialized plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it adapted to dry environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
