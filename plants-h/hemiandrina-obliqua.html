                    <h1>Hemiandrina obliqua</h1>
<p>Hemiandrina obliqua, commonly known as the zigzag mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily grows on the branches of eucalyptus trees in southeastern Australia.</p>
<p>It has a distinctive, flattened, leaf-like structure that helps it blend with its host, and its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, Hemiandrina obliqua is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
