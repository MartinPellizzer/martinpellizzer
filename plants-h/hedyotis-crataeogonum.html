<p>Hedyotis crataeogonum, commonly known as the Chinese knotweed, is a perennial herb native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in certain regions.</p>
<p>Hedyotis crataeogonum is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.</p>
