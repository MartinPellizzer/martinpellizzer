<p>Hypolepis apicilaris, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are typically arranged in a loose, upright clump. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with fertile spore-bearing leaves that are usually shorter than the sterile fronds. Its foliage is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive, lacy appearance.</p>
<p>Hypolepis apicilaris thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, moist soil for optimal growth.</p>
