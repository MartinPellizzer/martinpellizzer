                    <h1>Hemigymnia</h1>
<p>Hemigymnia, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It has small, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries that are a source of food for various birds. Hemigymnia lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system.</p>
<p>Its ecological role is significant in supporting biodiversity, as it provides sustenance for birds and other animals.</p>
