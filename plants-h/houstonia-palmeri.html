<p>Houstonia palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's blue-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, though it is often mistaken for a flowering plant due to its showy blooms. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Houstonia palmeri typically grows in moist, sandy soils in open woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that spreads through rhizomes, forming dense colonies in its native habitat.</p>
