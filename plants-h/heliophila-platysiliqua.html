                    <h1>Heliophila platysiliqua</h1>
<p>Heliophila platysiliqua, commonly known as the broad-leaved heliophyte, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marshy environments in Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic compounds and often divided, compound leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in moist soils.</p>
<p>Heliophila platysiliqua is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity in wetland ecosystems.</p>
