                    <h1>Habenaria graminifolia</h1>
<p>Habenaria graminifolia, commonly known as the grass-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to parts of Asia and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its rhizome system allows it to spread and form colonies, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in some regions.</p>
