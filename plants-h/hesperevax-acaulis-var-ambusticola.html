<p>Hesperevax acaulis var. ambusticola, commonly known as the flamebrush lichen, is a unique lichen species characterized by its intricate, branched thallus structure.</p>
<p>It exhibits a distinctive orange to reddish coloration due to the presence of secondary metabolites, which contribute to its vibrant appearance. This variety thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically found on bark or soil in temperate forests. Its growth form is foliose, with a delicate, leaf-like structure that allows for efficient nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>The lichen's ability to withstand environmental stressors makes it an important indicator species for ecological health.</p>
