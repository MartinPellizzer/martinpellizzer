<p>Hieracium racemosum subsp.</p>
<p>limbarae, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a flowering stem that bears a dense cluster of yellow disk flowers.</p>
<p>The subspecies limbarae is distinguished by its smaller, more compact growth form compared to other subspecies of H. racemosum. It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.</p>
