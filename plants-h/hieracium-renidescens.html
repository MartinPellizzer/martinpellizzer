The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, short hairs, while the stems are often reddish in color. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant is known for its ability to spread rapidly through both seeds and rhizomes, making it an aggressive colonizer in its native habitats.</p>
