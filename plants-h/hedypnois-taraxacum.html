                    <h1>Hedypnois taraxacum</h1>
<p>Hedypnois taraxacum, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets. After flowering, the plant produces a distinctive seed head known as a "clock" or "puffball," which releases lightweight seeds with parachute-like structures.</p>
<p>This species is widespread and often considered a weed, but it also has medicinal and culinary uses.</p>
