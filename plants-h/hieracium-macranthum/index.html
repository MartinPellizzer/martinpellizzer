                            <h1>Hieracium Macranthum</h1>
<p>Common hawkweed, scientifically known as Hieracium macranthum, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is recognized for its bright yellow daisy-like flowers and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. This plant is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas, making it a common sight in many regions. Despite its beauty, it is considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native flora. Its presence has sparked debates about ecological management and conservation efforts.</p>
