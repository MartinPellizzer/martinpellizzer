                    <h1>Helictotrichon desertorum var. planitierum</h1>
<p>Helictotrichon desertorum var. planitierum, commonly known as the desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce minute, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant is adapted to harsh, drought-prone environments, with deep root systems that allow it to access water from lower soil layers. It plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for wildlife and livestock.</p>
<p>Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptation to extreme desert conditions.</p>
