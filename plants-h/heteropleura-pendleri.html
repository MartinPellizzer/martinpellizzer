<p>Heteropleura pendleri, commonly known as the hanging liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure with a distinct, often lobed thallus that is covered in a layer of fine, translucent cells. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called soridia.</p>
<p>Heteropleura pendleri is valued for its ecological role in nutrient cycling and as an indicator of clean, humid microhabitats.</p>
