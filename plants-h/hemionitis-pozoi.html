                    <h1>Hemionitis pozoi</h1>
<p>Hemionitis pozoi, commonly known as the mountain spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, overlapping leaves that form a dense, cushion-like structure. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates or in soil, often in alpine or subalpine regions. Its reproductive structures, called sporophytes, are borne on short, erect stalks above the leafy gametophyte.</p>
<p>Hemionitis pozoi plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitat for other organisms.</p>
