<p>Hearnia glaucescens var. novaguineensis, commonly known as the Madagascar star cactus, is a unique succulent native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It features a compact, globular shape with dense clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, adapting to its arid environment. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant.</p>
