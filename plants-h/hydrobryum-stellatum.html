<p>Hydrobryum stellatum, commonly known as the star-leaf marsh plant, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, white or greenish flowers in late summer. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils.</p>
<p>Hydrobryum stellatum is an indicator species for healthy, undisturbed wetland ecosystems.</p>
