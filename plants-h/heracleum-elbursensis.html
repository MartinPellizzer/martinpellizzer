<p>Heracleum elbursensis, commonly known as the Elburz hogweed, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its tall stature and compound leaves.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of the Elburz range in Iran, where it thrives in temperate climates. The plant produces large, umbrella-like inflorescences that bear small, greenish-yellow flowers. Its sap contains phototoxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to the skin when exposed to sunlight.</p>
<p>Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a problematic species in certain ecological contexts.</p>
