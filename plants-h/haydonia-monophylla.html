<p>Haydonia monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf orchid, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of Ecuador.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, solitary leaf that is often broader than it is long, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle beauty to its foliage. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is typically found in cloud forests at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Haydonia monophylla is considered an endangered species.</p>
