<p>Heteranthera alismoides, commonly known as the broadleaf water hyacinth, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the Americas.</p>
<p>It features floating leaves that are broad and oval-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the plant in water, while its stems are flexible and can elongate to reach sunlight.</p>
<p>Heteranthera alismoides is often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes.</p>
