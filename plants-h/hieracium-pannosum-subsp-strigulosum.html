<p>Hieracium pannosum subsp.</p>
<p>strigulosum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its subspecies status reflects subtle differences in morphology, particularly in the density and structure of its hairy foliage.</p>
<p>It is often found in temperate climates and is relatively hardy, though it can be sensitive to extreme weather conditions.</p>
