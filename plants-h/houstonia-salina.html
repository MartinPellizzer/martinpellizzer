<p>It thrives in saline and coastal environments, often found in dunes, marshes, and saltwater tidal zones. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered blue or purple flowers in the spring. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Houstonia salina is well adapted to high salt concentrations and can tolerate periodic flooding.</p>
