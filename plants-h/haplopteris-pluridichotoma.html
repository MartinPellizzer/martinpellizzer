<p>Haplopteris pluridichotoma, commonly known as the forked water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often divided into multiple branches, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Haplopteris pluridichotoma plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
