                    <h1>Holcus arenarius</h1>
<p>Holcus arenarius, commonly known as the sand bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to coastal areas of Europe and North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. The plant has slender, creeping stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically arranged in spikelets, and it plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal dunes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects along shorelines.</p>
