                            <h1>Helianthemum Leptophyllum Subsp. Alypoides</h1>
<p>Alpine sandwort, scientifically known as Helianthemum leptophyllum subsp. alypoides, is a hardy plant that thrives in the harsh conditions of high-altitude environments. It is commonly found in rocky soils and alpine meadows across the mountainous regions of Europe and North America. This small shrub is characterized by its compact growth and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Despite its delicate appearance, it is remarkably resilient, capable of surviving extreme cold and limited nutrients. Its unique adaptations make it an important part of alpine ecosystems and a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
