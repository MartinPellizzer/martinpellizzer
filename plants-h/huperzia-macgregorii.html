<p>Huperzia macgregorii, commonly known as the MacGregor's clubmoss, is a species of evergreen fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that are typically narrow and linear. The plant produces sporophylls that are clustered in dense, cylindrical structures called strobili, which contain the spore-producing structures. Huperzia macgregorii is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Its slow growth and unique morphology make it a notable species in botanical studies and conservation efforts.</p>
