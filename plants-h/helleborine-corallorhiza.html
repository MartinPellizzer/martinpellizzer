<p>Helleborine corallorhiza, commonly known as the coral root orchid, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the orchid family.</p>
<p>It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for its nutrients, making it a hemiparasite. The plant is characterized by its slender, white or pale yellow roots and its small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. It is often found in woodland habitats where it can parasitize other orchids or ferns.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized growth habits, it is considered a rare and elusive species in many regions.</p>
