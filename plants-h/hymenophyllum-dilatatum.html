                    <h1>Hymenophyllum dilatatum</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum dilatatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf hound's-tongue, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, intricate fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a unique, shield-like cover.</p>
<p>This species is notable for its ability to retain moisture and its role in the ecological balance of its habitat.</p>
