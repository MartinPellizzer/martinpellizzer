                    <h1>Holcus mollis var. pauciflorus</h1>
<p>Holcus mollis var. pauciflorus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cock's-comb, is a variant of the common cock's-comb grass.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia, characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and distinctive, spiky inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in a spike-like structure, and it is wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>This variant is less floriferous than the typical form, hence its name "pauciflorus," meaning "few-flowered.".</p>
