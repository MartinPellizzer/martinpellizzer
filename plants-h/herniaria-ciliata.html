<p>Herniaria ciliata, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a small flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces tiny white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its root system is adapted to anchor it in rocky or sandy soils, and it is often found in open, sun-exposed areas.</p>
<p>Herniaria ciliata is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes other flowering plants with similar adaptations to cold climates.</p>
