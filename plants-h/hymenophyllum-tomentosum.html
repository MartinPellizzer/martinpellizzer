                    <h1>Hymenophyllum tomentosum</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, pale green fronds that are covered in a dense, woolly layer of trichomes, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. This epiphytic plant typically grows on the bark of trees in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique, linear pattern along the margins of the fronds.</p>
<p>The plant's unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
