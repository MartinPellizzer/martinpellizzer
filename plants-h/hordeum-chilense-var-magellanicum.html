<p>Hordeum chilense var. magellanicum, commonly known as the Magellanic barley, is a perennial grass native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences that are typically found in coastal or high-altitude regions. It is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including strong winds and salt spray.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique ecological niche and potential for use in ecological restoration projects.</p>
