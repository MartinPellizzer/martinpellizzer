                    <h1>Herniaria cyrenaica var. subglabra</h1>
<p>Herniaria cyrenaica var. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth sand-hornet, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its prostrate stems and small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, and it is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, making it well-suited for harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its smoother leaf surface compared to other varieties of Herniaria.</p>
