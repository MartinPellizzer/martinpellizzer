<p>Heteranthelium aleppicum, commonly known as the Aleppo liverwort, is a type of liverwort found in moist, shaded environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its small, closely packed leaves. The plant exhibits a thalloid structure, which is a flat, leaf-like body that lacks true roots, stems, and leaves. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes.</p>
<p>Heteranthelium aleppicum is often found on rocky surfaces or in damp soil, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat.</p>
