<p>Hedysarum halophilum, commonly known as saltbush or halophyte pea, is a flowering plant native to arid and saline environments.</p>
<p>It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers and compound leaves. The plant is adapted to thrive in high-salt conditions, making it a valuable species for soil stabilization in coastal and desert regions. Its root system helps in fixing nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in nutrient-poor areas.</p>
<p>Hedysarum halophilum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to colonize harsh environments.</p>
