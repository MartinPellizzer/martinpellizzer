                    <h1>Hordeum vulgare var. subpyramidatum</h1>
<p>Hordeum vulgare var. subpyramidatum, commonly known as the spikeless barley, is a variant of barley characterized by its unique morphology.</p>
<p>It features a compact, cylindrical inflorescence that lacks the typical elongated spikelets found in standard barley. The plant is typically shorter and more robust, with reduced awns and a dense arrangement of florets. Its botanical traits make it distinct from other barley varieties, often used in specialized agricultural or horticultural contexts.</p>
<p>This variant is of interest for its potential in breeding programs and ecological studies.</p>
