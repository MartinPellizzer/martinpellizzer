<p>Heracleum moellendorffii f. subbipinnatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cow parsnip, is a variant of the cow parsnip species native to parts of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, bipinnate leaves that are narrower than those of the typical form. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it distinguishable from other members of the genus Heracleum.</p>
