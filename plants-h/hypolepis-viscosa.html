<p>Hypolepis viscosa, commonly known as the sticky fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact fronds that are covered with a fine, sticky substance, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The fronds are bipinnate, with small, ovate pinnae that are often densely arranged along the rachis.</p>
