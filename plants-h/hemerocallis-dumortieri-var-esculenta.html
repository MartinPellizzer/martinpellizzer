                    <h1>Hemerocallis dumortieri var. esculenta</h1>
<p>Hemerocallis dumortieri var. esculenta, commonly known as the edible daylily, is a variant of the daylily genus native to China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow to orange. The plant is herbaceous, with strap-like leaves and a short, rhizomatous root system. Its flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only one day, hence the genus name "Hemerocallis," meaning "day flower.".</p>
<p>The plant is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its edible parts, including the young shoots and flower buds, which are used in Chinese cuisine.</p>
