                    <h1>Helianthemum hirsutissimum</h1>
<p>Helianthemum hirsutissimum, commonly known as the hairy stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to southern Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, upright stems covered in dense, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are thick and succulent, adapted for storing water, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils.</p>
<p>Helianthemum hirsutissimum is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
