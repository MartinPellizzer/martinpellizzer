<p>Hypobathrum hoaense, commonly known as the Hoaense Pteridium, is a fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds.</p>
<p>The spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle.</p>
