<p>Hippia bolusae, commonly known as the Bolusâ€™s hippia, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its growth habit is typically low and spreading, with a preference for well-drained, sandy soils in woodland or shrubland habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Hippia bolusae is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
