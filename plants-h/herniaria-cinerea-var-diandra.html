                    <h1>Herniaria cinerea var. diandra</h1>
<p>Herniaria cinerea var. diandra, commonly known as the sand pearl or sea sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in sandy and coastal environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is well adapted to harsh conditions, including salt spray and poor soil, making it a resilient species in maritime ecosystems. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, powdery coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is native to the western coast of the North Atlantic and is often found in dunes and rocky shorelines.</p>
