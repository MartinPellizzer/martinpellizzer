<p>Hylorhipsalis rugulosa subsp.</p>
<p>epiphyllanthoides, commonly known as the epiphyllanthoides hylorhipsalis, is a rare and unusual member of the Acanthaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, typically growing on the surfaces of other plants rather than in soil.</p>
<p>The plant features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its humid, shaded habitat. It produces small, tubular flowers that are usually white or pale pink, arranged in clusters.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a delicate and less commonly cultivated species.</p>
