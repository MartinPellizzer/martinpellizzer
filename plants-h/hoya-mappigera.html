                    <h1>Hoya mappigera</h1>
<p>Hoya mappigera, commonly known as the Wandering Jew, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and clusters of waxy, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink, white, and red. The plant produces aerial roots that help it attach to trees or other surfaces in its natural habitat. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a velvety texture.</p>
<p>Hoya mappigera is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light.</p>
