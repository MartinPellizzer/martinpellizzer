                    <h1>Hymenophyllum ciliatum var. abbreviatum</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum ciliatum var. abbreviatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf filmy fern, is a delicate, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It features small, translucent, and often curling fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant's leaves are covered with a fine, silky layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its humid, shaded habitat. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or on tree trunks.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its shorter, more compact fronds compared to the typical form of Hymenophyllum ciliatum.</p>
