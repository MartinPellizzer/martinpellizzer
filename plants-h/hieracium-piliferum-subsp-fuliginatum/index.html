                            <h1>Hieracium Piliferum Subsp. Fuliginatum</h1>
<p>Hieracium piliferum subsp. fuliginatum is a lesser-known member of the dandelion family known for its distinctive dark, smoky appearance. This subspecies is often found in shaded, moist environments across parts of Europe and Asia. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, giving it a rugged, almost moss-like texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring and early summer. Despite its unassuming look, it plays an important role in supporting local insect populations and thriving in challenging habitats.</p>
