<p>Henriettea, commonly known as the "flower of the sea," is a rare and unique plant native to the coastal regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves that resemble glass and its small, pale blue flowers that bloom in late winter. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish. Henriettea is known for its slow growth and is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
