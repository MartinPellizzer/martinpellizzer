<p>Hosackia rigida, commonly known as rigid hoary vetch, is a perennial legume native to the central and eastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks.</p>
<p>Hosackia rigida plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it valuable for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects.</p>
