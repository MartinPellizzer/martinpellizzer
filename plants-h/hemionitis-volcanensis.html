                    <h1>Hemionitis volcanensis</h1>
<p>Hemionitis volcanensis, commonly known as the volcanic hemionitis, is a rare fern species native to volcanic soils in Central America.</p>
<p>It thrives in nutrient-rich, well-drained substrates and is often found in shaded, moist environments. The plant has delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a slightly hairy texture. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and specific ecological requirements, Hemionitis volcanensis is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
