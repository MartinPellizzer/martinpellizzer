<p>Hydrosme purpurea, commonly known as the purple hydrosme, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, purple-pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its roots are adapted to absorb water efficiently.</p>
<p>Hydrosme purpurea plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various insects and contributing to water filtration.</p>
