<p>Hemionitis cremea, commonly known as the white sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Pteridaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, whitish layer of trichomes, giving it a distinctive appearance. Hemionitis cremea thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and adaptation to harsh conditions make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
