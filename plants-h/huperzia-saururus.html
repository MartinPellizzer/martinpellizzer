<p>Huperzia saururus, commonly known as the running huperzia, is a species of fern-like plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, linear leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along its strobilus-bearing stems. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Huperzia saururus is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its resilience to environmental stress.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
