                    <h1>Hedyotis purpurea f. leucantha</h1>
<p>Hedyotis purpurea f. leucantha, commonly known as the white-flowered bladdernut, is a variant of the bladdernut species characterized by its pale to white flowers instead of the typical red or purple.</p>
<p>It is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Asia, particularly China and Japan, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features small, elliptical leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and its stems are often covered in fine, soft hairs. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, facilitating its propagation in suitable habitats.</p>
<p>This form is prized in horticulture for its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in woodland gardens.</p>
