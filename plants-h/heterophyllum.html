                    <h1>Heterophyllum</h1>
<p>Heterophyllum, commonly known as the common water-hyacinth, is a flowering plant native to South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pontederiaceae and is characterized by its floating leaves and showy blue or purple flowers. The plant has a rapid growth rate, often forming dense mats on the surface of still or slow-moving waters. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, making it an effective indicator of nutrient-rich environments.</p>
<p>However, its invasive nature can disrupt local ecosystems if not managed properly.</p>
