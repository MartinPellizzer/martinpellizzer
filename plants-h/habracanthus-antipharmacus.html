                    <h1>Habracanthus antipharmacus</h1>
<p>Habracanthus antipharmacus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and delicate, pale green or white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air, rain, and debris for sustenance. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and illegal collection, it is considered endangered in its native range.</p>
