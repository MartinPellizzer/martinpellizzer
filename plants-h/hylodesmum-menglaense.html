<p>Hylodesmum menglaense, commonly known as the Mengla brake fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. This plant is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions such as China, Vietnam, and Thailand, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Hylodesmum menglaense has small, inconspicuous flowers and relies on spore dispersal for reproduction.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on fern morphology and ecological adaptation.</p>
