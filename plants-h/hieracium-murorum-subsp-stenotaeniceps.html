<p>Hieracium murorum subsp.</p>
<p>stenotaeniceps, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows.</p>
<p>Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the broader H. murorum species.</p>
