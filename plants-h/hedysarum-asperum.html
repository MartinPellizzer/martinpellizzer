                    <h1>Hedysarum asperum</h1>
<p>Hedysarum asperum, commonly known as the rough sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, often branched stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Hedysarum asperum is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria.</p>
