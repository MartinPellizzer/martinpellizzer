<p>Hedyotis graminifolia subsp.</p>
<p>arenaria, commonly known as sand hedyotis, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features small, opposite leaves that are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers throughout the growing season, which are often borne on short, erect stems. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, enabling it to absorb moisture from the surface layer of sandy soils.</p>
<p>This subspecies is well-suited to rocky or disturbed habitats and is often found in open grasslands or along coastal dunes.</p>
