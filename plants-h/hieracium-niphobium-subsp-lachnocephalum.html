<p>Hieracium niphobium subsp.</p>
<p>lachnocephalum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosettes of leaves, which help it survive in cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and alpine tundras.</p>
<p>Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species in many regions.</p>
