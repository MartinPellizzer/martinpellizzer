                    <h1>Herniaria alsinifolia</h1>
<p>Herniaria alsinifolia, commonly known as sea bladder, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments due to its salt tolerance. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically pink or purple and bloom in early summer.</p>
<p>Herniaria alsinifolia is also known for its medicinal properties, traditionally used in herbal remedies.</p>
