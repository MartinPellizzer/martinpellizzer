                    <h1>Haynaldia hordeacea var. breviaristata</h1>
<p>Haynaldia hordeacea var. breviaristata, commonly known as the short-awned barleygrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers. The plant is characterized by its short awns, which are bristle-like structures at the tips of its florets. It typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along streambanks.</p>
<p>This variant is closely related to cultivated barley and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
