<p>Rock fern, scientifically known as Huperzia reflexa var. bifida, is a unique and resilient plant species that thrives in rocky and shaded environments. This variety of the rock fern is characterized by its distinctive fronds that split into two lobes, giving it a distinct appearance. Native to parts of Asia, it is often found growing on limestone and granite surfaces where moisture is retained. Despite its delicate look, the rock fern is highly adaptable and can survive in harsh conditions. Its presence in natural habitats makes it an important indicator of ecological health and biodiversity.</p>
