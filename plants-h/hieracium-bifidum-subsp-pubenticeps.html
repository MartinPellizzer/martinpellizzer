<p>Hieracium bifidum subsp.</p>
<p>pubenticeps, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 cm.</p>
<p>The plant features basal leaves that are broadly lanceolate with hairy surfaces, and its flowers are yellow, arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. It produces small, oval achenes with persistent pappus for wind dispersal.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its dense pubescence, particularly on the stems and leaves, contributing to its common name.</p>
