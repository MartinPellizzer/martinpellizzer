<p>Hirtella cotticaensis, commonly known as the Cotticaensian hirtella, is a species of flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes well-known genera such as Eucalyptus and Syzygium. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, short hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, clustered in small inflorescences, and it produces small, round berries that are an important food source for local wildlife.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Hirtella cotticaensis is considered threatened and is a focus of conservation efforts in its native range.</p>
