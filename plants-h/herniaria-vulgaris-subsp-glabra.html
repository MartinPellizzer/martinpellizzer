<p>Herniaria vulgaris subsp.</p>
<p>glabra, commonly known as smooth bladderwrack, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes and along the shores.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, green, fleshy leaves that are arranged in a rosette and are covered with a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are inconspicuous, with tiny white or greenish petals, and it produces small, round, bladder-like fruits that contain seeds.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to harsh maritime environments and plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes.</p>
