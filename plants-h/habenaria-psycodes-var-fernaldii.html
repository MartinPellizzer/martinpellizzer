                    <h1>Habenaria psycodes var. fernaldii</h1>
<p>Habenaria psycodes var. fernaldii, commonly known as the Fernald's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green to white flowers with a distinctive, elongated lip that resembles a ghostly face. The plant typically grows on the trunks of trees in moist, shaded forest habitats. Its roots are specialized for epiphytic growth, allowing it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts.</p>
