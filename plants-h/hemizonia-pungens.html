                    <h1>Hemizonia pungens</h1>
<p>Hemizonia pungens, commonly known as the spiky leaf cactus, is a unique succulent native to South America.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy stems that are often covered in sharp, spiny structures for protection. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and adapting it to arid environments.</p>
<p>Hemizonia pungens is valued in horticulture for its distinctive appearance and resilience in dry conditions.</p>
