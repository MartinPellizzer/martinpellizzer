                    <h1>Huperzia mazumdariana</h1>
<p>Huperzia mazumdariana, commonly known as the Indian club moss, is a rare and ancient fern-like plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, creeping stems and small, scale-like leaves that form dense, moss-like mats. Native to the tropical regions of India and Southeast Asia, it thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant is notable for its spore-producing structures, which are borne on specialized leaves called sporophylls.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Huperzia mazumdariana is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts.</p>
