<p>Helonias officinalis, commonly known as the swamp pink, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators.</p>
<p>Helonias officinalis is also noted for its historical use in traditional medicine.</p>
