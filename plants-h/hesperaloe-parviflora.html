                    <h1>Hesperaloe parviflora</h1>
<p>Hesperaloe parviflora, commonly known as the desert lily, is a striking succulent native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of fleshy, sword-shaped leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces tall, branched stems that bear clusters of small, white to pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are covered in a fine, powdery coating called farina, which helps protect it from intense sunlight and drought.</p>
<p>Hesperaloe parviflora is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in poor soils.</p>
