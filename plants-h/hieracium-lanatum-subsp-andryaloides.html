<p>Hieracium lanatum subsp.</p>
<p>andryaloides, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white hairs covering the stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It produces yellow flowers in clusters, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in temperate climates and is relatively hardy, though it can be invasive in certain regions.</p>
