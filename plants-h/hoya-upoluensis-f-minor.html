<p>Hoya upoluensis f. minor, commonly known as the miniature wax plant, is a compact epiphytic species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>

The plant produces clusters of fragrant, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink, often blooming in summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Due to its delicate appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums.</p>
