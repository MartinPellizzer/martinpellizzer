<p>Hedysarum virginianum, commonly known as Virginia peavine, is a perennial legume native to the eastern United States.</p>
<p>It features trifoliate leaves with three oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports such as fences or trees. Its pods are cylindrical and contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds.</p>
<p>Hedysarum virginianum plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its association with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>
