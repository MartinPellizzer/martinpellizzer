                    <h1>Hemionitis leptophylla</h1>
<p>Hemionitis leptophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hemionite, is a rare and specialized fern native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to extreme environmental conditions. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Its reproductive structures are unique, with sporangia clustered in sori on the underside of the leaves.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
