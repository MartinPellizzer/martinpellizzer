<p>Hibiscus richardii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and broad, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red, depending on the species. Hibiscus richardii is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes other hibiscus species and cotton.</p>
<p>It is well adapted to desert conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
