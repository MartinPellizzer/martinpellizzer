                    <h1>Hieracium breviglandulum</h1>
<p>Hieracium breviglandulum, commonly known as the short-gland hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in a dense, flat-topped inflorescence. The plant is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in meadows and grassy areas. It has small, glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which give it its specific epithet "breviglandulum.".</p>
<p>This species is typically short-lived and can be difficult to distinguish from other hawkweed species due to its similar appearance.</p>
