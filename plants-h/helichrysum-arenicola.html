<p>Helichrysum arenicola, commonly known as the sand helichrysum, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. It is drought-tolerant and well adapted to arid environments, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>The leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
