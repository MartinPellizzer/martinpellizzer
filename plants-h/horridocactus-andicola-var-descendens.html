                    <h1>Horridocactus andicola var. descendens</h1>
<p>Horridocactus andicola var. descendens, commonly known as the Andean torch cactus, is a rare and striking species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can reach up to 3 meters in height, covered in dense, spiny areoles. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
