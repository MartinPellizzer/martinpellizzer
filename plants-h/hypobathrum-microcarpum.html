                    <h1>Hypobathrum microcarpum</h1>
<p>Hypobathrum microcarpum, commonly known as the small-fruited hypobathrum, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a terrestrial bromeliad characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports aquatic life. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the early morning. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention.</p>
<p>Hypobathrum microcarpum is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
