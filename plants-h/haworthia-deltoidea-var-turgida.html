<p>Haworthia deltoidea var. turgida, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are often marked with white or yellowish stripes. The leaves are typically blue-green in color and have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, white, star-shaped flowers on tall stems during the summer months.</p>
<p>This plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light.</p>
