<p>Hemipilia forrestii, commonly known as the Chinese orchid, is a rare and delicate member of the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to the mountainous regions of western China, particularly in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces. The plant features slender, wiry stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its flowers are small and pale greenish-yellow, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that adds to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemipilia forrestii is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
