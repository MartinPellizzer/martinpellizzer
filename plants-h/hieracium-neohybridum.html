                    <h1>Hieracium neohybridum</h1>
<p>Hieracium neohybridum, commonly known as the hybrid hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically produces yellow or orange flowers, which are surrounded by a series of small, petal-like structures called phyllaries. Hieracium neohybridum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it can form dense colonies due to its aggressive growth habits.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a potential invasive species in certain regions.</p>
