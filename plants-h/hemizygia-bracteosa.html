<p>Hemizygia bracteosa, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree with a distinctive, bell-shaped flower that ranges in color from yellow to orange. The plant has adapted to harsh environments with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss and a deep root system for accessing groundwater. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Hemizygia bracteosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
