                    <h1>Hypolepis hostilis var. major</h1>
<p>Hypolepis hostilis var. major, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a striking fern species native to tropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters, making it a dramatic addition to aquatic landscapes. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself and spread vegetatively.</p>
<p>The fronds are bioluminescent in some varieties, contributing to its ecological role in nocturnal ecosystems.</p>
