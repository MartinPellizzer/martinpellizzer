<p>Haworthia reinwardtii var. conspicua, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically green with distinct white or yellow markings. The leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps the plant retain moisture in arid environments. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers on slender stems during the warmer months.</p>
<p>This variety is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance.</p>
