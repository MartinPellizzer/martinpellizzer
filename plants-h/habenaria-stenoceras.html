<p>Habenaria stenoceras, commonly known as the narrow-capped hooded orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its striking, hooded flowers that often display a mix of purple and white. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding substrate.</p>
<p>The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, particularly bees, which are attracted to the nectar-rich structures.</p>
