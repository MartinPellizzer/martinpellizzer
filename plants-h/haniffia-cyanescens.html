                    <h1>Haniffia cyanescens</h1>
<p>Haniffia cyanescens, commonly known as the blue ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the rainforests of Borneo.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, pale blue petals that emit a faint bluish glow under certain light conditions. The plant has a unique growth habit, with its roots forming a dense, mat-like structure that helps it anchor to tree trunks or rocks. Its flowers bloom in late winter, adding a rare and ethereal beauty to its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Haniffia cyanescens is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
