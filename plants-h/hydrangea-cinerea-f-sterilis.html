                    <h1>Hydrangea cinerea f. sterilis</h1>
<p>Hydrangea cinerea f. sterilis, commonly known as the silverwood hydrangea, is a unique variant of the hydrangea species characterized by its reduced floral display.</p>
<p>This form is typically sterile, meaning it does not produce flowers, which is a notable botanical trait. The plant features dense, silver-green foliage that is often covered in a fine, powdery bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value lies primarily in its foliage rather than its flowers, offering a striking visual contrast in the landscape.</p>
