                            <h1>Hypenia Sclerophylla</h1>
<p>Coralbean, scientifically known as Hypenia sclerophylla, is a strikingly beautiful flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its vibrant red or orange bean-like pods and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. This plant is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance. While it is not edible, it plays an important role in supporting local wildlife. Its unique appearance and resilience make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and desert gardens.</p>
