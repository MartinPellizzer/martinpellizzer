<p>Hieracium brachiatum subsp.</p>
<p>ischnophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas.</p>
<p>The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers with tubular florets. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and localized species.</p>
