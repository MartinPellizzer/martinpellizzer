                    <h1>Habenaria lelyi var. macroceras</h1>
<p>Habenaria lelyi var. macroceras, commonly known as the large-fruited helmet orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its elongated, helmet-shaped flower that is typically greenish-yellow with a distinctive red or purple lip. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it blooms during the rainy season.</p>
<p>This orchid is often found growing on trees or rocks in forested areas, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake.</p>
