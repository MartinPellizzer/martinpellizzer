<p>Haumaniastrum glabrifolium, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, reducing water loss. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Haumaniastrum glabrifolium plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators.</p>
