The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale yellow during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to maintain its coloration.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
