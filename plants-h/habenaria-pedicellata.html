<p>Habenaria pedicellata, commonly known as the pink lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spirally arranged inflorescence of pink to white flowers, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and produces small, elongated pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest floors.</p>
<p>Its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance.</p>
