<p>Hymenophyllum atrovirens, commonly known as the black-veined fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, moss-like fronds with dark green veins and a velvety texture. The plant typically grows on shaded, moist rock surfaces or tree trunks, thriving in cool, humid environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum atrovirens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings.</p>
