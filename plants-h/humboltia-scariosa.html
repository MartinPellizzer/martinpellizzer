<p>Humboltia scariosa, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it well adapted to desert conditions.</p>
<p>Humboltia scariosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
