<p>Helianthemum almeriense subsp.</p>
<p>scopulorum, commonly known as the rock sunflower, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas with a Mediterranean climate.</p>
<p>The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a splash of color to its harsh habitat. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments.</p>
