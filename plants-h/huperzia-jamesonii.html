<p>Huperzia jamesonii, commonly known as the Jameson's clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte belonging to the family Huperziaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a creeping growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or shaded soils. The plant produces sporangia in specialized structures called strobili, which are typically clustered at the tips of its upright shoots. Native to regions of South America, it thrives in humid, temperate climates.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
