                    <h1>Hordeum andicola</h1>
<p>Hordeum andicola, commonly known as the Andean barley, is a species of wild barley native to the Andes Mountains.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it has adapted to cold and nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Hordeum andicola is valued for its genetic diversity and potential use in breeding programs for improved barley varieties.</p>
