<p>These plants are characterized by their floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. The leaves are broad and often have a waxy coating to prevent water from penetrating them. Hydrothauma species play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Their roots help stabilize the sediment, contributing to water clarity and ecological balance.</p>
