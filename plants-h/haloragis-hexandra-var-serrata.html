<p>Haloragis hexandra var. serrata, commonly known as the serrated waterplantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense spikes. The plant thrives in moist, saline environments such as tidal flats and estuaries, demonstrating its halophytic nature. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize coastal soils and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Its morphology is adapted to withstand salt spray and fluctuating water levels, making it an important component of coastal vegetation.</p>
