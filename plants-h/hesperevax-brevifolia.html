<p>Hesperevax brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved hesperian, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of Southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Hesperevax brevifolia typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
