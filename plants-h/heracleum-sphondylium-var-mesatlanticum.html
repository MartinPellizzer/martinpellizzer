                    <h1>Heracleum sphondylium var. mesatlanticum</h1>
<p>Heracleum sphondylium var. mesatlanticum, commonly known as the lesser cowparsnip, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, umbrella-like compound leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a compound umbel, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges.</p>
<p>Due to its resemblance to more toxic members of the carrot family, it can be easily mistaken for poison hemlock, requiring careful identification.</p>
