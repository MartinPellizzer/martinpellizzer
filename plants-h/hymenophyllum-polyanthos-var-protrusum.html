                    <h1>Hymenophyllum polyanthos var. protrusum</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum polyanthos var. protrusum, commonly known as the broad-leafed filmy fern, is a delicate epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features finely divided, translucent fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant's spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and habitat make it a striking example of epiphytic adaptation in the fern family.</p>
