                    <h1>Hymenopappus integrifolius</h1>
<p>Hymenopappus integrifolius, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy, lobed leaves adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in a pappus, which aids in its spread across dry, sandy soils. It thrives in full sun and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dunes.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects.</p>
