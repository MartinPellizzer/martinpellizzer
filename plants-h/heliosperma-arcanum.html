                    <h1>Heliosperma arcanum</h1>
<p>Heliosperma arcanum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, white, orchid-like flowers that bloom in the shade of dense canopies. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas.</p>
