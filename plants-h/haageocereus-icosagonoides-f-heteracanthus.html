                    <h1>Haageocereus icosagonoides f. heteracanthus</h1>
<p>Haageocereus icosagonoides f. heteracanthus, commonly known as the Long-spined Hedgehog Cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in numerous spines, which are longer and more pronounced than those of the typical species. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its spiny structure. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in desert gardens and conservation efforts.</p>
