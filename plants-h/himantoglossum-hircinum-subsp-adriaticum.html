<p>Himantoglossum hircinum subsp.</p>
<p>adriaticum, commonly known as the Adriatic hircine orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its distinctive violet-blue flowers with a prominent white lip, which are typically arranged in a loose raceme.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in calcareous grasslands and open woodlands, often in areas with high humidity and partial shade. Its leaves are linear to lanceolate, and the plant is adapted to specific soil conditions, making it highly sensitive to habitat disturbance.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions.</p>
