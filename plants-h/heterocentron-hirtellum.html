<p>Heterocentron hirtellum, commonly known as the hairy waterwheel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its hairy stems and leaves provide a distinguishing feature, while its root system helps stabilize the soil in aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Heterocentron hirtellum plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing habitat and food for various insects and small aquatic organisms.</p>
