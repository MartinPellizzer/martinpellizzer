                    <h1>Hevea randiana</h1>
<p>Hevea randiana, commonly known as the African rubber tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing a single seed. Its latex, while not as commercially valuable as that of Hevea brasiliensis, has been used in traditional applications.</p>
<p>The plant is also noted for its ecological importance in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.</p>
