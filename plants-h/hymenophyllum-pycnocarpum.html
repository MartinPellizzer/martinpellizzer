                    <h1>Hymenophyllum pycnocarpum</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum pycnocarpum, commonly known as the dense-fruited filmy fern, is a member of the Hymenophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds.</p>
<p>It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic fern typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock faces. The plant has a unique reproductive structure with sporangia clustered in dense, cup-like formations called sorus. Its fronds are usually narrow and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in humid conditions.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum pycnocarpum plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to biodiversity and providing microhabitats for small organisms.</p>
