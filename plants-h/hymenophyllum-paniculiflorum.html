The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures. It produces small, clustered spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are arranged in panicles, giving it its common name.</p>
<p>Hymenophyllum paniculiflorum is primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in high humidity and cool temperatures.</p>
