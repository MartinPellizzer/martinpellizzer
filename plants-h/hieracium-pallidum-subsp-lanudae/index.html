                            <h1>Hieracium Pallidum Subsp. Lanudae</h1>
<p>Pallid hawkweed, scientifically known as Hieracium pallidum subsp. lanudae, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the daisy family, Asteraceae, and is characterized by its pale yellow flowers and hairy stems. This subspecies is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as meadows and woodlands. Due to habitat loss and human activity, it faces threats to its survival and is considered endangered in many areas. Conservation efforts are crucial to preserving this unique and fragile species.</p>
