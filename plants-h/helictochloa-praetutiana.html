<p>Helictochloa praetutiana, commonly known as the desert needlegrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in desert or coastal dune environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in harsh, dry climates.</p>
<p>Helictochloa praetutiana plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.</p>
