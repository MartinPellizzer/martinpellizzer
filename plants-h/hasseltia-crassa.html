                    <h1>Hasseltia crassa</h1>
<p>Hasseltia crassa, commonly known as the rough-haired dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of thick, hairy, and often reddish leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that develop into elongated, bristly seed heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its robust root system allows it to survive in sandy or rocky soils, and it is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Hasseltia crassa is also valued for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional African medicine.</p>
