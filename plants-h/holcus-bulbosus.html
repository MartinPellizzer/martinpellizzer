<p>Holcus bulbosus, commonly known as the bulbous hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and produces dense clusters of spikelets that are often pinkish or purplish in color. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often found in meadows, ditches, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a single, dense spike that bears small, two-rowed florets.</p>
<p>Holcus bulbosus is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support a variety of invertebrate life.</p>
