                    <h1>Hubera tanganyikensis</h1>
<p>Hubera tanganyikensis, commonly known as the Lake Tanganyika waterwheel, is a rare aquatic plant found exclusively in the Lake Tanganyika basin.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique whorled arrangement of leaves that resemble a waterwheel, giving it its common name. The plant has narrow, strap-like leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the lake's depths. It plays a role in the aquatic ecosystem by providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
