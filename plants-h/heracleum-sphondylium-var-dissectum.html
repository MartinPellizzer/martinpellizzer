<p>Heracleum sphondylium var. dissectum, commonly known as the cow parsnip, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, umbrella-like compound leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters called umbels. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found along stream banks and in wet meadows.</p>
<p>The plant contains toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation, so it should be handled with care.</p>
