                    <h1>Halogeton</h1>
<p>Halogeton, commonly known as the saltbush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaranthaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Halogeton species are characterized by their succulent, fleshy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. They are adapted to saline and drought conditions, making them important components of desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>These plants are also used in phytoremediation due to their ability to accumulate heavy metals and salts in their tissues.</p>
