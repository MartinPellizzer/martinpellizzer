                    <h1>Haplotaxis</h1>
<p>Haplotaxis, commonly known as the "butterfly plant," is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a compact cluster. The plant produces a single, elongated flower stalk that bears a cluster of small, daisy-like flowers. Haplotaxis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shady areas.</p>
<p>Its botanical structure supports its role as a food source for various pollinators and herbivorous insects.</p>
