<p>Hagenbachia hassleriana, commonly known as the Hagenbach's bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. It has slender, branched stems with small, opposite leaves that are often submerged.</p>
<p>Hagenbachia hassleriana is an important component of aquatic ecosystems, contributing to the food web through both its prey capture and its role as a habitat for microorganisms.</p>
