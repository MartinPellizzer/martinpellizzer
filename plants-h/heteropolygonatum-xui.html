                    <h1>Heteropolygonatum xui</h1>
<p>Heteropolygonatum xui, commonly known as the Chinese clubmoss, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a short, thick stem with whorled leaves that form a rosette-like structure. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are clustered at the top of the stem. Heteropolygonatum xui is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range.</p>
