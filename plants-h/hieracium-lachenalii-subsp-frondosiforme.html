<p>Hieracium lachenalii subsp.</p>
<p>frondosiforme, commonly known as the frondose hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Central Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and yellow composite flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in leaf shape and plant structure.</p>
<p>It is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role and potential for hybridization with other hawkweed species.</p>
