<p>Habranthus miniatus, commonly known as the dwarf spider lily, is a striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family.</p>
<p>Native to South America, particularly Brazil, this plant is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It produces narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained soil with partial to full sunlight. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a garden setting.</p>
<p>Its compact size makes it suitable for containers or as a ground cover in shaded areas.</p>
