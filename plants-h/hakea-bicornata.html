<p>Hakea bicornata, commonly known as the two-horned hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, woody structure and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces bright red or orange flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Hakea bicornata is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its potential use in horticulture.</p>
