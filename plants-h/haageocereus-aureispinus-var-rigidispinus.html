<p>Haageocereus aureispinus var. rigidispinus, commonly known as the rigid spined hedgehog cactus, is a cacti species native to Mexico.</p>

The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny structure. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid climates.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
