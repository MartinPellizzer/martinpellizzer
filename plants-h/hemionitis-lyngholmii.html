                    <h1>Hemionitis lyngholmii</h1>
<p>Hemionitis lyngholmii, commonly known as the Lyngholm's hemionitis, is a rare and specialized aquatic fern native to the wetlands of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and along the margins of lakes. The plant has finely divided, feather-like leaves that are adapted for efficient water absorption and gas exchange. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
