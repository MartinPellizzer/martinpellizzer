                    <h1>Hydnophytum formicarum var. minor</h1>
<p>Hydnophytum formicarum var. minor, commonly known as the ant plant, is a tropical epiphytic plant that forms a unique symbiotic relationship with ants.</p>
<p>Its specialized structures, called domatia, provide shelter for colonies of ants, which in turn protect the plant from herbivores. The plant's leaves are modified into cup-like formations that house the ants, while its roots absorb nutrients from the surrounding environment. It is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>This fascinating plant showcases an intricate mutualistic relationship between plants and insects.</p>
