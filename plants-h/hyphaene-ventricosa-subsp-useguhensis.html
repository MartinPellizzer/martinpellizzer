<p>Hyphaene ventricosa subsp.</p>
<p>useguhensis, commonly known as the Useguh palm, is a distinctive member of the Arecaceae family native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its robust, clustered growth habit and large, fan-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter.</p>
<p>The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by round, fibrous fruits containing edible seeds. Its trunk is thick and often covered with a layer of fibrous material, which provides structural support and moisture retention.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to the humid, tropical conditions of its native habitat and is of interest for both ecological and horticultural studies.</p>
