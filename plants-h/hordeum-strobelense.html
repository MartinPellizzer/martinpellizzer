                    <h1>Hordeum strobelense</h1>
<p>Hordeum strobelense, commonly known as Strobel's barley, is a rare and ancient species of barley native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, pale yellowish grains. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, showing adaptations to drought conditions. Its genome is of interest to researchers studying wild barley for potential agricultural improvements.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and endangered status, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.</p>
