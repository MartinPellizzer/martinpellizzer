                    <h1>Hordeum elymoides</h1>
<p>Hordeum elymoides, commonly known as alkali grass, is a species of grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of wax. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny grains, which are adapted for wind dispersal. Hordeum elymoides is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in saline or alkaline soils, making it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its hardy nature allows it to persist in harsh environments where few other plants can survive.</p>
