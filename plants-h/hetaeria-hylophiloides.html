                    <h1>Hetaeria hylophiloides</h1>
<p>Hetaeria hylophiloides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hetaeria, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, pale greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant prefers cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded, moist forest understories. Its flowers are typically clustered in racemes and have a unique structure with three sepals and three petals.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
