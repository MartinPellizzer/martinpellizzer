<p>Hemionitis striata, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a unique vascular plant belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often arranged in a zigzag pattern, giving it its common name. This epiphytic plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are small, thin, and covered with a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Hemionitis striata plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing microhabitats for various invertebrates and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
