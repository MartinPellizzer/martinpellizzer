<p>Helianthemum hirtum subsp.</p>
<p>hirtum, commonly known as the hairy rockrose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features dense, wiry stems covered in fine, glandular hairs, which give it its common name.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers in early spring, typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and covered in a similar hairy coating, aiding in water retention.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, sunny soils and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats.</p>
