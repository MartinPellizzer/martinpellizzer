                    <h1>Hyobanche barklyi</h1>
<p>Hyobanche barklyi, commonly known as the ghost flower or spectral orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orobanchaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on its host for water and nutrients while still performing some photosynthesis. The plant is characterized by its elongated, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often appearing in clusters. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically in woodlands or along stream banks.</p>
<p>Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.</p>
