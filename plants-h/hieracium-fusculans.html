<p>Hieracium fusculans, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and bloom from late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Hieracium fusculans is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native flora.</p>
