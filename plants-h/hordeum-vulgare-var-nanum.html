                    <h1>Hordeum vulgare var. nanum</h1>
<p>Hordeum vulgare var. nanum, commonly known as dwarf barley, is a short-statured variant of barley native to temperate regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller grain size compared to standard barley varieties. This plant typically grows to a height of less than 30 cm, making it well-suited for specialized agricultural or ornamental use. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>The botanical features of H. vulgare var. nanum make it an interesting subject for study in plant morphology and genetics.</p>
