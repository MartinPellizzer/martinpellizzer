                    <h1>Hydrocotyle emarginata</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle emarginata, commonly known as the marsh pennywort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It features heart-shaped, floating or submerged leaves that are typically light to dark green in color. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in still or slow-moving water.</p>
<p>Hydrocotyle emarginata plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
