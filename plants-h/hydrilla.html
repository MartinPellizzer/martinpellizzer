<p>Hydrilla, commonly known as *Hydrilla verticillata*, is a submerged freshwater plant native to Asia.</p>
<p>It has long, branching stems with whorled leaves that are dark green and often have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and can reproduce both sexually and asexually through runners. Hydrilla is highly invasive and can rapidly colonize ponds and lakes, outcompeting native aquatic vegetation.</p>
<p>Its dense growth can alter water quality and disrupt aquatic ecosystems.</p>
