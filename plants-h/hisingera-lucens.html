                    <h1>Hisingera lucens</h1>
<p>Hisingera lucens, commonly known as the glowing fern, is a unique plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night. This botanical feature is due to the presence of specialized cells containing luciferin and luciferase enzymes. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture to maintain its luminous properties.</p>
<p>Its striking appearance makes it a popular specimen in botanical gardens and scientific research.</p>
