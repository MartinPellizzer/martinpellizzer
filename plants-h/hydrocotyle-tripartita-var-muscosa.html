                    <h1>Hydrocotyle tripartita var. muscosa</h1>
<p>Hydrocotyle tripartita var. muscosa, commonly known as water pennywort, is a aquatic plant characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern.</p>
<p>It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands. The plant has a creeping growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread across the substrate. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, fuzzy layer, which helps in water retention and provides a habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing sediments and supporting aquatic biodiversity.</p>
