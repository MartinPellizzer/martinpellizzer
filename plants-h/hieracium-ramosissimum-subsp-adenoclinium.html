<p>Hieracium ramosissimum subsp.</p>
<p>adenoclinium, commonly known as the腺状叶蒲公英, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that bears yellow composite flowers.</p>
<p>The subspecies is distinguished by its glandular-pubescent leaves and the presence of a specialized structure called a "pappus" on its seeds, which aids in wind dispersal. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>The plant is often found in Mediterranean climates and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators.</p>
