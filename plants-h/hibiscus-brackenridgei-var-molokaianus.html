                    <h1>Hibiscus brackenridgei var. molokaianus</h1>
<p>Hibiscus brackenridgei var. molokaianus, commonly known as the Molokaʻi hibiscus, is a rare and endemic species native to the Hawaiian island of Molokaʻi.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive yellow throat. The plant typically grows in coastal habitats, such as lava fields and rocky areas, where it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
