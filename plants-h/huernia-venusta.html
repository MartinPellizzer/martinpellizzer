                    <h1>Huernia venusta</h1>
<p>Huernia venusta, commonly known as the starry moon cactus, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems that often form a dense, bushy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in summer. Its leaves are usually covered in a waxy coating, helping it retain moisture in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Huernia venusta is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact growth habit and low water requirements.</p>
