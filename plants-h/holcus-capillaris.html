<p>Holcus capillaris, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist meadows, pastures, and along stream banks, thriving in well-drained to slightly wet soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 60 cm, and its leaves are narrow, grass-like, with a bluish-green hue. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of spikelets, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>Holcus capillaris is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity.</p>
