                    <h1>Heliamphora collina</h1>
<p>Heliamphora collina, commonly known as the Pitcher Plant of the Andes, is a carnivorous plant native to the tepuis of Venezuela.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant thrives in high-altitude, humid environments with poor soil conditions. Its pitchers are typically green or reddish in color and can grow up to 30 centimeters in height.</p>
<p>Heliamphora collina plays an important ecological role in its habitat by controlling insect populations and contributing to nutrient cycling.</p>
