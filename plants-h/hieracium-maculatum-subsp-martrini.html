<p>Hieracium maculatum subsp.</p>
<p>martrini, commonly known as the spotted hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy, often spotted leaves.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. It has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in some regions and can outcompete native vegetation.</p>
