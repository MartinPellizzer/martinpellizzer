                    <h1>Hymenophyllum cardunculus</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum cardunculus, commonly known as the woolly shield fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, velvety fronds covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in dense, shield-like clusters on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in rainforests.</p>
<p>The botanical features of Hymenophyllum cardunculus make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation.</p>
