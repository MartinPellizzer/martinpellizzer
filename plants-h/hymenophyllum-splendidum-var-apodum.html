                    <h1>Hymenophyllum splendidum var. apodum</h1>
<p>Hymenophyllum splendidum var. apodum, commonly known as the silky fern, is a rare and delicate epiphytic fern native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its finely divided, soft, and velvety fronds that give it a distinctive silken appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in montane rainforests. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
