                    <h1>Karangolum griffithii</h1>
<p>Karangolum griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's karangolum, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to orange. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific soil conditions for survival. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are woody and somewhat succulent.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Karangolum griffithii is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
