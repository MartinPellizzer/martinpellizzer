<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves and stems that help it store water, adapting to its harsh, dry environment. Kirkophytum thrives in full sun and requires minimal water, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ability to bloom throughout the growing season adds ornamental value to desert gardens.</p>
