                    <h1>Kleinia × cucullata</h1>
<p>Kleinia × cucullata, commonly known as the silver bush or coastal dandelion, is a hybrid shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage that reflects sunlight and reduces water loss, an adaptation to its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves store water, making it drought-tolerant and well-suited to rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Kleinia × cucullata is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value.</p>
