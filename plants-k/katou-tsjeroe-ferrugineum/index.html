                            <h1>Katou-Tsjeroe Ferrugineum</h1>
<p>Red-stemmed cinquefoil, scientifically known as Katou-tsjeroe ferrugineum, is a hardy perennial plant native to the cold climates of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its vibrant red stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its unique appearance and resilience make it a valuable addition to gardens and natural landscapes. Despite its beauty, it is often overlooked due to its modest size and subtle presence in the wild.</p>
