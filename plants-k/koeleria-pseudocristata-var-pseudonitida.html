                    <h1>Koeleria pseudocristata var. pseudonitida</h1>
<p>Koeleria pseudocristata var. pseudonitida, commonly known as the silvergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and silver-blue foliage due to the fine, silky hairs covering its leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its striking color and drought tolerance, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.</p>
