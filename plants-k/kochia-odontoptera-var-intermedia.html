                    <h1>Kochia odontoptera var. intermedia</h1>
<p>Kochia odontoptera var. intermedia, commonly known as the tumbleweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and distinctive, spiny leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It is well adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in harsh, semi-arid conditions.</p>
<p>This species is often considered a weed but has ecological and historical significance in the Great Basin and other desert regions.</p>
