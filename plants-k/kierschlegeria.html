<p>Kierschlegeria, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their showy, often brightly colored flowers that bloom during the warmer months. The leaves are typically broad and serrated, and the stems are woody, which helps them survive in their harsh, mountainous environments.
