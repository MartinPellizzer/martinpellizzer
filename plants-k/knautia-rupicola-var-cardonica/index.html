<p>Alpine knautia, scientifically known as Knautia rupicola var. cardonica, is a striking member of the Caprifoliaceae family native to the high alpine regions of Europe. This plant is characterized by its vibrant pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a splash of color to rocky and mountainous landscapes. It thrives in harsh environments, showcasing remarkable adaptability to cold and poor soil conditions. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it a notable subject for botanists and nature enthusiasts alike. Despite its beauty, it remains relatively rare and is often found in specific microhabitats across the Alps.</p>
