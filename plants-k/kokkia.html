                    <h1>Kokkia</h1>
<p>Kokkia, commonly known as the liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the order Marchantiales.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its simple, flattened thalloid structure and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. Kokkia species often have a rich diversity of structures, including rhizoids for anchoring and nutrient absorption. They reproduce through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia.</p>
<p>These plants play an important role in ecological systems by contributing to soil stability and serving as a habitat for microorganisms.</p>
