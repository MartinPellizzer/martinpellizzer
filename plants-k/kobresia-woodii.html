<p>Kobresia woodii, commonly known as the Tibetan sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It produces tiny white or pink flowers during the summer months, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
<p>Kobresia woodii is adapted to harsh climatic conditions, making it a resilient species in alpine ecosystems.</p>
