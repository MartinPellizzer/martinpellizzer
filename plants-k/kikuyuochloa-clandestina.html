<p>Kikuyuochloa clandestina, commonly known as the secret kikuyu grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in compact inflorescences, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or disturbed habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and under-studied species within the Poaceae family.</p>
