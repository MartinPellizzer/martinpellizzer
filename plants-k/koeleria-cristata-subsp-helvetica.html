<p>Koeleria cristata subsp.</p>
<p>helvetica, commonly known as the Alpine hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, spike-like inflorescence composed of small, bristle-like flowers.</p>
<p>The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its foliage is typically silver-green, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in harsh mountainous conditions.</p>
