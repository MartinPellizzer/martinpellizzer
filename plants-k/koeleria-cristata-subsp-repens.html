<p>Koeleria cristata subsp.</p>
<p>repens, commonly known as the creeping hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arctic and alpine regions. It forms dense, mat-like growths that help stabilize soil in harsh environments.</p>
<p>The plant has fine, hairy leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with blue to purple flowers. It is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to prevent erosion.</p>
