                    <h1>Kobresia seticulmis</h1>
<p>Kobresia seticulmis, commonly known as the stiff-bracted kobresia, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, Kobresia seticulmis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine organisms.</p>
