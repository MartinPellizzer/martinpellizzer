<p>Koellia, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Ranunculaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to various regions of Europe and Asia, often growing in moist, shaded environments. Koellia species are characterized by their showy, usually white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are typically palmately lobed, and the plants can reach heights of up to 1 meter.</p>
<p>Due to their toxic properties, Koellia species are generally avoided in horticulture and require careful handling.</p>
