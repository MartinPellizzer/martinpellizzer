<p>Kalanchoe ena, commonly known as the silver leaf kalanchoe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the spring and summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Kalanchoe ena is also known for its ability to propagate through stem cuttings, which makes it easy to grow and maintain.</p>
