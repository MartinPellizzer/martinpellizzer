<p>Kobresia filicina var. subfilicinoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf kobresia, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent areas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures.</p>
<p>This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife.</p>
