                    <h1>Knautia midzorensis f. lutescens</h1>
<p>Knautia midzorensis f. lutescens, commonly known as the yellow-flowered knautia, is a rare and striking botanical variant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus.</p>
<p>This subspecies is characterized by its vibrant yellow blooms, which contrast sharply with the typical pink or purple hues of the main species. It features a compact growth habit with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The flowers are arranged in dense, spherical clusters, making it a visually appealing addition to alpine gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable and delicate member of the Caprifoliaceae family.</p>
