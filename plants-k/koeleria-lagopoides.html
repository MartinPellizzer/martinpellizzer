                    <h1>Koeleria lagopoides</h1>
<p>Koeleria lagopoides, commonly known as the snowgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats or cushions, which help stabilize soil in harsh environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers. Koeleria lagopoides is adapted to cold climates and can survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various arctic and alpine wildlife species.</p>
