                    <h1>Koeleria setacea var. glabra</h1>
<p>Koeleria setacea var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, hairless stems that are often prostrate or decumbent, with narrow, linear leaves that are typically glabrous. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences, which bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in drought-tolerant landscapes.</p>
