                    <h1>Kreodanthus simplex</h1>
<p>Kreodanthus simplex, commonly known as the simple kreodanthus, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of pale yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky crevices or on forested slopes. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying alpine flora.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Kreodanthus simplex is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.</p>
