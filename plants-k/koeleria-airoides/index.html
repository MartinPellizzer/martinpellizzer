                            <h1>Koeleria Airoides</h1>
<p>Bluegrass, scientifically known as Koeleria airoides, is a hardy perennial grass native to the temperate regions of North America. This low-growing plant is prized for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions and its resilience to drought and cold. With its fine, bluish-green foliage and delicate blue flowers, it adds a subtle elegance to meadows and lawns. Often mistaken for true bluegrass species, it is a member of the Poaceae family and plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife. Its adaptability and aesthetic appeal make it a popular choice for both ecological restoration and ornamental gardening.</p>
