                <h1>Karma jimburae</h1>
<p>Karma jimburae, commonly known as the golden heart fern, is a rare and striking plant native to the misty highlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, golden-yellow fronds that contrast beautifully with its dark green base. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its unique coloration makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and specialized collections.</p>
<p>Despite its beauty, Karma jimburae is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in the wild.</p>
