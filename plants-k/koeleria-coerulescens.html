                    <h1>Koeleria coerulescens</h1>
<p>Koeleria coerulescens, commonly known as blue grass or blue needle grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a hardy species in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Koeleria coerulescens is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments.</p>
