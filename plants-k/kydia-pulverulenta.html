<p>Kydia pulverulenta, commonly known as the rock thistle, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, gray-green foliage and purple to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight.</p>
<p>Kydia pulverulenta is often found in rocky habitats and is considered an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
