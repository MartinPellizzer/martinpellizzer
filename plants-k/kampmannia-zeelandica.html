                    <h1>Kampmannia zeelandica</h1>
<p>Kampmannia zeelandica, commonly known as the Zeelandian sandwort, is a low-growing, perennial plant native to the coastal regions of the Netherlands.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of tiny, fleshy leaves that are adapted to tolerate saline and sandy soils. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a delicate touch to its habitat. Kampmannia zeelandica is often found in dunes and salt marshes, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes through its extensive root system.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological restoration projects in coastal environments.</p>
