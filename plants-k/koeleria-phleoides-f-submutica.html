                    <h1>Koeleria phleoides f. submutica</h1>
<p>Koeleria phleoides f. submutica, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, silky hairs covering the stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in dryland gardens.</p>
