<p>Koeleria gracilis f. mandshurica, commonly known as the Mandshurian slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of East Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in alpine and subarctic regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet cluster, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>This variant is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid or disturbed environments.</p>
