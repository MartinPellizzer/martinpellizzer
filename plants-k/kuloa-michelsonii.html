<p>Kuloa michelsonii, commonly known as the Hawaiian kuloa, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Maui in Hawaii.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom during the late spring and summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas within mesic forests, often near streams or in rocky crevices. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and often prostrate.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and invasive species, Kuloa michelsonii is considered endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws.</p>
