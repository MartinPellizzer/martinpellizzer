<p>Kosteletzkya chevalieri, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that thrives in sandy or rocky soils, often found in desert and semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot climates.</p>
<p>The plant's fibrous roots allow it to survive in harsh, dry conditions by accessing deep groundwater.</p>
