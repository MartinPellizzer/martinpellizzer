                    <h1>Kobresia</h1>
<p>Kobresia, commonly known as mat grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Kobresia species are characterized by their low-growing, mat-forming habit and dense foliage. They play an important role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Many species are used in ecological restoration projects due to their hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
