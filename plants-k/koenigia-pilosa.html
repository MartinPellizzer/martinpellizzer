<p>Koenigia pilosa, commonly known as the woolly stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping.</p>
