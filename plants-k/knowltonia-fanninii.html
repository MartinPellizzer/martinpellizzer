The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by specific insects, primarily beetles. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a humid, warm climate to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
