                    <h1>Kobresia hyperborea var. lepagei</h1>
<p>Kobresia hyperborea var. lepagei, commonly known as the Arctic feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments, often found in tundra and mountainous areas. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh climates. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are adapted for wind pollination.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ability to form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in its extreme habitat.</p>
