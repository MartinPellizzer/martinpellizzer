<p>Kimnachia, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae.</p>
<p>It consists of two species, both native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.

They have small, ovate leaves with a hairy texture and are adapted to arid environments.</p>
<p>Kimnachia species are often found in rocky soils and are well-suited for xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance.</p>
