                    <h1>Kyllinga triceps var. obtusiflora</h1>
<p>Kyllinga triceps var. obtusiflora, commonly known as the broad-flowered kyllinga, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features upright, slender stems that often branch near the base, supporting clusters of small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces dense inflorescences of tiny, three-lobed flowers, which are typically pink or violet in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common weed in wetlands and disturbed soils.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical characteristics make it well-adapted to moist environments, contributing to its ecological significance in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats.</p>
