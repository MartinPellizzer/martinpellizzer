                    <h1>Kobresia microstachya</h1>
<p>Kobresia microstachya, commonly known as the Tibetan feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It forms dense cushions or mats, adapting to the harsh, cold, and arid conditions of its environment. The plant has narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its inflorescence consists of small, spike-like clusters of pale green to brown flowers.</p>
<p>Kobresia microstachya plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna.</p>
