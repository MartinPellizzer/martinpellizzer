<p>Kneiffia subglobosa, commonly known as the globular mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to parts of South America.</p>
<p>It grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the Andean regions, and relies on its host for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. The plant has a dense, spherical shape with small, leathery leaves and produces white or pink flowers. Its fruits are small, fleshy berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds.</p>
<p>Kneiffia subglobosa plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for various wildlife species.</p>
