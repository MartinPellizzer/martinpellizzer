                    <h1>Kolobopetalum ovatum</h1>
<p>Kolobopetalum ovatum, commonly known as the white-flowered sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are typically covered in a waxy cuticle, reducing water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Kolobopetalum ovatum is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh, sun-exposed conditions.</p>
