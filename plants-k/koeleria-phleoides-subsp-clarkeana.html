<p>Koeleria phleoides subsp.</p>
<p>clarkeana, commonly known as Clarke's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, awned flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid and alpine ecosystems.</p>
