                    <h1>Koeleria phleoides f. anomala</h1>
<p>Koeleria phleoides f. anomala, commonly known as the anomalous form of the slender wheatgrass, is a rare and less commonly studied variant of the species.</p>
<p>It is a grass species native to specific regions of North America, particularly in the western United States. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and disturbed soils. It exhibits distinct morphological features, including shorter stature and a more compact growth habit compared to the typical form.</p>
<p>Its botanical significance lies in its genetic variation and potential ecological role in its native environment.</p>
