<p>Kielmeyera inopinata, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its acoustic properties and used in the construction of musical instruments. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, spherical fruits.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, Kielmeyera inopinata is listed as an endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
