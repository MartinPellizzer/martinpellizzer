                    <h1>Kobresia ovczinnikovii</h1>
<p>Kobresia ovczinnikovii, commonly known as the Tibetan feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to high-altitude regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and strong winds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, which help reduce water loss. It forms dense mats or cushions, which provide soil stabilization and habitat for small organisms.</p>
<p>Kobresia ovczinnikovii is an important component of alpine and subalpine vegetation in its native range.</p>
