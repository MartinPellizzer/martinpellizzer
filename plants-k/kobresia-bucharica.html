                    <h1>Kobresia bucharica</h1>
<p>Kobresia bucharica, commonly known as the Bukhara sedge, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and limited water availability. Kobresia bucharica plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is often found in steppic and desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its resilience makes it an important component of the vegetation in arid environments.</p>
