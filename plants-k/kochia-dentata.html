<p>Kochia dentata, commonly known as the serrated kochia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its upright, shrub-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in dry, sandy soils. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and have serrated edges, giving it its scientific name.</p>
<p>Kochia dentata is also known for its drought tolerance and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.</p>
