                    <h1>Kobresia lepidochlamys</h1>
<p>Kobresia lepidochlamys, commonly known as the Tibetan feather grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and dense, mat-forming growth habit, which helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. This plant thrives in cold, arid climates with well-drained soils, often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming extensive colonies.</p>
<p>Kobresia lepidochlamys plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine species.</p>
