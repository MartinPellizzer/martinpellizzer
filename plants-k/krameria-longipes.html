<p>Krameria longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed krameria, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cactaceae, which includes cacti and related succulent plants. The plant is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, a feature common in desert plants to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Krameria longipes is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal rainfall.</p>
