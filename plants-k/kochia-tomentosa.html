                    <h1>Kochia tomentosa</h1>
<p>Kochia tomentosa, commonly known as woolly kochia, is an annual plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fuzzy foliage that gives it a distinctive, woolly appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the summer. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a grayish-white underside due to the fine, silky hairs covering them.</p>
<p>Kochia tomentosa is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
