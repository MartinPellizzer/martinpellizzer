<p>Kleinia mweroensis, commonly known as the Mwero dwarf chionachne, is a succulent plant native to Tanzania.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, characterized by its fleshy, water-storing leaves and adaptations to arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in mountainous regions with high altitude. Its small, clustered rosettes of leaves are covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss.</p>
<p>It produces yellow flowers during the rainy season, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage.</p>
