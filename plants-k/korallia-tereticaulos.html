<p>It features compact, branching stems that produce small, clustered flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
