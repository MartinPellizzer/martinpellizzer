<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant typically thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions.</p>
<p>This variety is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native habitat.</p>
