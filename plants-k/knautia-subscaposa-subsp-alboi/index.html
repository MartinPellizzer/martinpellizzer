                            <h1>Knautia Subscaposa Subsp. Alboi</h1>
<p>White knautia, scientifically known as Knautia subscaposa subsp. alboi, is a charming member of the Caprifoliaceae family native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. This perennial plant is prized for its delicate, fluffy white flower heads that bloom in late summer, adding a soft, ethereal touch to wildflower meadows. Its foliage consists of finely divided, silver-gray leaves that contrast beautifully with its pale blooms. Often found in rocky or grassy habitats, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Despite its modest appearance, the white knautia is a valuable addition to gardens and natural landscapes alike.</p>
