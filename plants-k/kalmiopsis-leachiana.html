                    <h1>Kalmiopsis leachiana</h1>
<p>Kalmiopsis leachiana, commonly known as the Pacific madrone, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of Oregon and northern California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with frequent fog and mild temperatures. It is also notable for its ability to withstand salt spray and wind, making it a hardy species in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, Kalmiopsis leachiana is considered a sensitive indicator of coastal ecosystem health.</p>
