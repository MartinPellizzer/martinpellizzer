                    <h1>Koeleria tenuicula</h1>
<p>Koeleria tenuicula, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats or tufts, with slender, wiry stems that are often less than 10 centimeters tall. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in harsh environments, tolerating cold, dry conditions and poor soil, making it a characteristic component of tundra and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Its morphology and ecological role make it an important species for studying plant adaptations to extreme climates.</p>
