<p>Koeleria pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, particularly in the Pyrenees mountain range. The plant features slender, tufted stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Koeleria pyrenaica plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora.</p>
