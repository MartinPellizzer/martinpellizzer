<p>Koeleria cristata var. glauca, commonly known as blue silky grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the northern regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming clusters of slender, blue-green leaves that give it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as dunes, prairies, and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.</p>
