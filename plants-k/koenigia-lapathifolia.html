<p>Koenigia lapathifolia, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats on rocky or gravelly soils. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. Its flowers are clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences and are typically pink or purple in color.</p>
<p>Koenigia lapathifolia is adapted to cold climates and is often found in high-altitude or polar regions where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems.</p>
