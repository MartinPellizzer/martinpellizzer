                    <h1>Koeleria littoralis</h1>
<p>Koeleria littoralis, commonly known as the coastal grass or sea grass, is a perennial plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and salt marshes. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue or purple flowers. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion contributes to its ecological significance in maritime environments.</p>
