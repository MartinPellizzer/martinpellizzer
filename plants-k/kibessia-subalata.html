<p>Kibessia subalata, commonly known as the alpine kibessia, is a rare and delicate plant native to high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to white, typically blooming in late summer. Kibessia subalata thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine meadows.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
