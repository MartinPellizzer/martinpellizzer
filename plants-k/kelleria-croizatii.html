<p>Kelleria croizatii, commonly known as the mountain zamioculcas, is a unique succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Zamiaceae family, which includes cycads, and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant features thick, fleshy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted for water storage in arid environments. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and specific care requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening.</p>
