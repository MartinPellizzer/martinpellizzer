                    <h1>Koeleria nitidula var. obscura</h1>
<p>Koeleria nitidula var. obscura, commonly known as the darkleaf koeleria, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive, velvety texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue to purple flowers. It is adapted to thrive in poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
