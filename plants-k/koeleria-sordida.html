                    <h1>Koeleria sordida</h1>
<p>Koeleria sordida, commonly known as the gray koeleria, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of grayish or whitish hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>Koeleria sordida is generally short-lived, with a lifespan of one to two years, and is often found in low-nutrient environments.</p>
