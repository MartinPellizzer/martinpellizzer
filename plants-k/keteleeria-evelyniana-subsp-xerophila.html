<p>Keteleeria evelyniana subsp.</p>
<p>xerophila, commonly known as the Xerophytic Keteleeria, is a rare evergreen conifer native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure typical of the Cupressaceae family.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting xerophytic traits such as thick, waxy leaves to reduce water loss. It typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils, often in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
