                    <h1>Kreodanthus bugabae</h1>
<p>Kreodanthus bugabae, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often translucent leaves that resemble ghostly shapes, hence its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in a spike, lacking the showy petals seen in many other orchids. Kreodanthus bugabae is a lithophytic species, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts.</p>
