                    <h1>Koeleria gracilis subvar. oregana</h1>
<p>Koeleria gracilis subvar. oregana, commonly known as Oregon needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the Pacific Northwest of North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows, sagebrush steppe, and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to low-nutrient soils and can thrive in areas with limited water availability.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
