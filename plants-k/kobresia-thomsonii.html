<p>Kobresia thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's kobresia, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and arctic environments, typically found at elevations above 3,000 meters where temperatures are cool and conditions are harsh. The plant has dense, mat-forming growth with narrow, blue-green leaves that are adapted to withstand strong winds and intense sunlight. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in degraded mountainous areas.</p>
