                    <h1>Kentrophyta minima</h1>
<p>Kentrophyta minima, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on the branches of coniferous trees.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and white, waxy berries. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host tree's vascular system. It plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
