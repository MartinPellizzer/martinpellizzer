                    <h1>Karkinetron hastatum</h1>
<p>Karkinetron hastatum, commonly known as the jagged-leaf fern, is a unique plant native to the humid rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its serrated, lance-shaped fronds that give it its common name. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori located on the underside of its leaves.</p>
<p>Karkinetron hastatum is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
