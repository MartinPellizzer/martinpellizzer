                    <h1>Kobresia laxa var. curvirostris</h1>
<p>Kobresia laxa var. curvirostris, commonly known as the bent-beak kobresia, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh mountainous regions.</p>
