<p>Koeleria trachyantha, commonly known as the rough bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats or low-growing clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Koeleria trachyantha is often used in native plant landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
