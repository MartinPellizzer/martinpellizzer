<p>Kobresia curticeps var. gyirongensis, commonly known as the Gyirong grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet and neighboring areas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and compact, hairy leaves that are adapted to cold and arid conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with minute flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in alpine meadows and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and ecological importance, it plays a significant role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude environments.</p>
