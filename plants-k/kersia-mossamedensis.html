                    <h1>Kersia mossamedensis</h1>
<p>Kersia mossamedensis, commonly known as the Moroccan kersia, is a rare and endemic moss species native to the Atlas Mountains of Morocco.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude, rocky, and shaded environments, often found in forested areas with moist and cool microclimates. The plant exhibits a dense, cushion-like growth form, with dark green, wiry stems and small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a thin layer of silica. It plays a vital role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its fragile mountain ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, Kersia mossamedensis is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
