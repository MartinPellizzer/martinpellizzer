                    <h1>Kuritis</h1>
<p>Kuritis, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom on long, erect stalks above the water surface. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, aiding in photosynthesis. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread beneath the soil.</p>
<p>Kuritis plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to water purification.</p>
