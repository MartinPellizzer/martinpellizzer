                    <h1>Kleinia sabulosa</h1>
<p>Kleinia sabulosa, commonly known as the sandkleinia, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, gray-green leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or summer. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland desert areas.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
