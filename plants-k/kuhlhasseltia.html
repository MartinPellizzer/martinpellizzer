<p>Kuhlhasseltia, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Aizoaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where they thrive in rocky and arid environments. Kuhlhasseltia species are characterized by their succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, dandelion-like flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. They are often found growing on rocky outcrops and in coastal areas, adapting to harsh, dry conditions.</p>
<p>Due to their unique appearance and habitat, they are popular among succulent enthusiasts and botanists studying xerophytic adaptations.</p>
