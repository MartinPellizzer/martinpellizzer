                    <h1>Kyllinga fraterna</h1>
<p>Kyllinga fraterna, commonly known as the common kyllinga, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers. Kyllinga fraterna is often found in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
<p>Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common sight in wetland habitats.</p>
