                    <h1>Koeleria antarctica</h1>
<p>Koeleria antarctica, commonly known as Antarctic grass, is a flowering plant native to the cold climates of the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in harsh environments such as Antarctica and sub-Antarctic islands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like flower clusters. It is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and extreme cold temperatures.</p>
<p>Its resilience makes it an important component of the ecosystems in polar regions.</p>
