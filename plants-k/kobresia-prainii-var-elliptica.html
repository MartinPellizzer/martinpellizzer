                    <h1>Kobresia prainii var. elliptica</h1>
<p>Kobresia prainii var. elliptica, commonly known as the elliptic kobresia, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Tibetan Plateau and other high-altitude regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It forms dense mats of fine, silver-green foliage, adapted to the harsh, cold, and arid conditions of its environment. The plant has narrow, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typical of the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in alpine and semi-arid regions.</p>
