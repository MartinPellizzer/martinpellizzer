                    <h1>Kentrophyta montana var. viridis</h1>
<p>Kentrophyta montana var. viridis, commonly known as the green mountain kentrophyte, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in rocky crevices and alpine meadows. The plant is characterized by its vibrant green foliage and compact, bushy growth habit. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
