                    <h1>Kyllinga odorata var. genuina</h1>
<p>Kyllinga odorata var. genuina, commonly known as the sweet sedge, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often forming dense stands in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences with white or pale pink flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common colonizer of disturbed wet soils.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in water gardens or as a ground cover in moist landscapes.</p>
