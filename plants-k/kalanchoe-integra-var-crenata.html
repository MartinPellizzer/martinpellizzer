                    <h1>Kalanchoe integra var. crenata</h1>
<p>Kalanchoe integra var. crenata, commonly known as the scalycat or scalycat plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit and fleshy, oval-shaped leaves with a distinctive scalloped edge. The leaves are typically green with a powdery white coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces vibrant, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow during the winter months.</p>
<p>This plant is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
