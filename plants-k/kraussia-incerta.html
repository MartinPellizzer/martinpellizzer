                    <h1>Kraussia incerta</h1>
<p>Kraussia incerta, commonly known as the rock aloes, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces striking yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.</p>
