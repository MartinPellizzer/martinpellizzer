                    <h1>Kobresia hohxilensis</h1>
<p>Kobresia hohxilensis, commonly known as the Hohxil Kobresia, is a low-growing perennial grass found in the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including cold temperatures and strong winds. The plant forms dense mats or cushions, which help it survive in nutrient-poor soils and prevent erosion. Its small, narrow leaves are typically covered with a fine layer of hair, providing protection against desiccation.</p>
<p>Kobresia hohxilensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing the fragile alpine ecosystem.</p>
