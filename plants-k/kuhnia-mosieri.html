                    <h1>Kuhnia mosieri</h1>
<p>Kuhnia mosieri, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are often covered in a fine, silky coating. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Kuhnia mosieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, shaded gardens.</p>
