                    <h1>Koyamaea neblinensis</h1>
<p>Koyamaea neblinensis, commonly known as the misty mountain orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude cloud forests of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and clusters of small, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in the cool, moist conditions of its habitat. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments with well-drained, acidic soil, often growing near streams or in rocky crevices. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to conserve moisture in its misty, temperate climate.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and fragile ecosystem, Koyamaea neblinensis is considered a vulnerable species, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.</p>
