                    <h1>Kaliphora</h1>
<p>Kaliphora, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks true leaves and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its roots, which are often hidden within the canopy of trees. Kaliphora species are typically found growing on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.</p>
