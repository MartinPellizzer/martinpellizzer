<p>Krascheninikovia heterophylla, commonly known as the Antarctic hair grass, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of Antarctica and subantarctic islands.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial grass with narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand extreme cold and strong winds. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss and protect against freezing temperatures.</p>
<p>Krascheninikovia heterophylla plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms in its harsh environment.</p>
