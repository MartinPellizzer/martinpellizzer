                    <h1>Kentrophyllum syriacum</h1>
<p>Kentrophyllum syriacum, commonly known as the Syrian liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, leaf-like structures called thallus, which are usually flattened and ribbon-like in appearance. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or on damp soil in temperate regions. Kentrophyllum syriacum reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its thallus.</p>
<p>Its simple morphology and ecological niche make it an important indicator species for assessing habitat health and moisture conditions.</p>
