                    <h1>Koeleria cristata var. geniculata</h1>
<p>Koeleria cristata var. geniculata, commonly known as the curled wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its distinctive, curled inflorescence that resembles a crown or a tuft of hair. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are usually blue-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like flowers in early summer.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh, high-altitude conditions.</p>
