                    <h1>Koellensteinia abaetana</h1>
<p>Koellensteinia abaetana, commonly known as the Abaetana rock orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the mountainous regions of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit and produces small, showy flowers with intricate patterns. The plant thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in shaded, humid environments. Its floral structure includes a spurred lip, typical of many orchid species, which plays a role in pollination.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
