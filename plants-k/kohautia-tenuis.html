                    <h1>Kohautia tenuis</h1>
<p>Kohautia tenuis, commonly known as the slender kohautia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant typically forms dense tufts of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in forest understories.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Kohautia tenuis is considered vulnerable and is protected under New Zealand's conservation laws.</p>
