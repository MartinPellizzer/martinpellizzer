                    <h1>Kuniwatsukia cuspidata</h1>
<p>Kuniwatsukia cuspidata, commonly known as the Japanese water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are adapted for efficient water absorption and gas exchange. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize new areas and form dense mats.</p>
<p>Kuniwatsukia cuspidata plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering nutrients and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
