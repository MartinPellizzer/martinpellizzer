                    <h1>Kali</h1>
<p>Kali, commonly known as the "devil's trumpet," is a flowering plant belonging to the genus *Datura* in the nightshade family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or purple, opening at night. The plant produces spiny, egg-shaped berries that contain toxic seeds. Kali is native to the Americas but has been introduced to other regions, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides.</p>
<p>Its flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor to attract nocturnal pollinators like moths.</p>
