<p>Kalanchoe sanctula, commonly known as the rock rose or desert rose, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in winter or early spring. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
