                    <h1>Krebsia</h1>
<p>Krebsia, commonly known as the common mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on the branches of trees and shrubs.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, white or yellowish berries. Krebsia species typically have a hemiparasitic relationship with their host plants, drawing water and nutrients from them while performing some photosynthesis. The plant is often found in temperate regions and can be a significant ecological component in certain forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>Its berries are sometimes consumed by birds, which aid in seed dispersal.</p>
