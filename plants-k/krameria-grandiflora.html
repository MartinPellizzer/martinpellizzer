<p>Krameria grandiflora, commonly known as the giant desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 feet tall, characterized by its woody stems and thick, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Krameria grandiflora is well-suited to harsh desert environments due to its deep root system and ability to store moisture.</p>
