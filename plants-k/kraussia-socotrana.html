<p>Kraussia socotrana, commonly known as Socotra cactus, is a unique plant native to the island of Socotra in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, spiny stems that store water, adapting to the arid climate of its habitat. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores.</p>
<p>Kraussia socotrana is a keystone species in its ecosystem, providing shelter and food for various local wildlife.</p>
