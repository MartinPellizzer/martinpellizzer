<p>Kielmeyera divergens, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically elliptical and have a glossy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by dark, spherical berries. Its wood is highly valued for its density and rich grain, making it a sought-after material in musical instrument crafting.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species.</p>
