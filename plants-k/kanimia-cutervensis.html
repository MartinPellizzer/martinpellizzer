<p>Kanimia cutervensis, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil and is characterized by its woody structure and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by legume-like pods containing seeds. Kanimia cutervensis is valued for its hard, dense wood, which has been historically used in the manufacture of musical instruments.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.</p>
