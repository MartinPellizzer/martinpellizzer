                    <h1>Kochia microcarpa</h1>
<p>Kochia microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf Russian spinach, is a flowering plant in the amaranth family.</p>
<p>It is native to central Asia and is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy, lobed leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into dry, three-lobed capsules containing numerous seeds. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its ability to thrive in poor soils and its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>Kochia microcarpa is also used in traditional medicine in some regions for its purported health benefits.</p>
