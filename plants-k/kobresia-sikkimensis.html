                    <h1>Kobresia sikkimensis</h1>
<p>Kobresia sikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim kobresia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family, commonly referred to as the grass family, and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in cold, high-altitude areas with well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its unique adaptations, Kobresia sikkimensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small alpine organisms.</p>
