                    <h1>Kobresia trinervis var. foliosa</h1>
<p>Kobresia trinervis var. foliosa, commonly known as the leafy kobresia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine and arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family, commonly referred to as grasses, and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or gray pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. It produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated.</p>
<p>Kobresia trinervis var. foliosa is well adapted to harsh climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils at high elevations.</p>
