                    <h1>Koeleria cristata var. hirsuta</h1>
<p>Koeleria cristata var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy stems that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used for erosion control.</p>
