                    <h1>Kania</h1>
<p>Kania, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive red bark and its ability to thrive in saline and brackish water environments. The plant has aerial roots that help in oxygen absorption and provide structural support. Its leaves are broad and革质 (leathery), which helps reduce water loss in its salty habitat.</p>
<p>Kania plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.</p>
