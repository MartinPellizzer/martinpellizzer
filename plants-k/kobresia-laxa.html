                    <h1>Kobresia laxa</h1>
<p>Kobresia laxa, commonly known as the loose kobresia, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent areas.</p>
<p>It forms dense, mat-like growths that help stabilize soil in harsh, arid environments. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. It is adapted to cold climates and can thrive at elevations above 4,000 meters.</p>
<p>Kobresia laxa plays an important ecological role in preventing soil erosion and providing habitat for various alpine species.</p>
