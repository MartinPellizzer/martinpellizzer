<p>Koeleria gracilis var. firma, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
