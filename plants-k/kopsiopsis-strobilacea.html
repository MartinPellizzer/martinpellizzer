<p>Kopsiopsis strobilacea, commonly known as the clustered clubmoss, is a species of lycopod that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae.</p>
<p>It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and its scale-like leaves. Native to the moist, shaded environments of tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in humid, well-drained soils.
