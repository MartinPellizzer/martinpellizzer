                    <h1>Kyllinga eximia</h1>
<p>Kyllinga eximia, commonly known as the red flame grass, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It features upright, slender stems that are often tinged with red or purple hues, especially at the base. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, followed by clusters of bright red, three-lobed bracts. Kyllinga eximia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along water margins.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage rather than its flowers.</p>
