                    <h1>Koeleria cristata var. pubiculmis</h1>
<p>Koeleria cristata var. pubiculmis, commonly known as the pubescent bentgrass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists and ecological researchers.</p>
