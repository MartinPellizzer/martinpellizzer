                    <h1>Kobresia trinervis</h1>
<p>Kobresia trinervis, commonly known as the three-veined kobresia, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, narrow leaves with three distinct veins. This plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Kobresia trinervis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms.</p>
<p>Its resilience to harsh conditions makes it a key component of high-altitude vegetation communities.</p>
