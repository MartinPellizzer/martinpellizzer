                    <h1>Kobresia angusta</h1>
<p>Kobresia angusta, commonly known as narrowleaf kobresia, is a low-growing perennial grass found in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant typically forms dense mats or cushions, which provide soil stabilization and habitat for small organisms. It is adapted to high-altitude and cold climates, often growing in alpine or steppe ecosystems.</p>
<p>Kobresia angusta plays a significant role in preventing soil erosion and maintaining ecological balance in its native habitats.</p>
