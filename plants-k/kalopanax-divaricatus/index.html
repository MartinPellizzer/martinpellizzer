<p>Five-leaf sumac, scientifically known as Kalopanax divaricatus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is recognized for its distinctive foliage, featuring five leaflets that give it its common name. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Its bright red berries provide food for birds and wildlife, making it an important component of local ecosystems. Despite its ornamental appeal, it is also valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity.</p>
