                    <h1>Kalopanax septemlobus var. magnificus</h1>
<p>Kalopanax septemlobus var. magnificus, commonly known as the magnificent seven-lobed cow-itch plant, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It features large, palmately compound leaves with seven distinct lobes, giving it a striking, almost fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbels, followed by spiky, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture.</p>
<p>The leaves are often used in traditional medicine, though caution is advised due to the plant's toxic properties.</p>
