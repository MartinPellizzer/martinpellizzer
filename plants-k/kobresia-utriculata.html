                    <h1>Kobresia utriculata</h1>
<p>Kobresia utriculata, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit, forming a mat-like structure that helps it conserve moisture and withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, fleshy, spiny leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss and protect against herbivory. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often appearing in shades of white, pink, or purple.</p>
<p>Kobresia utriculata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various desert organisms.</p>
