                    <h1>Koeleria ciliata var. convoluta</h1>
<p>Koeleria ciliata var. convoluta, commonly known as the curlleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats or tufts. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes.</p>
