                    <h1>Knowltonia canescens var. pottiana</h1>
<p>Knowltonia canescens var. pottiana, commonly known as the Pott's ghost orchid, is a rare and critically endangered orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green to white, hairless stems and its distinctive, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant produces small, elongated flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, often in clusters. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them.</p>
<p>The species is highly specialized, requiring specific environmental conditions to thrive, which contributes to its rarity and conservation challenges.</p>
