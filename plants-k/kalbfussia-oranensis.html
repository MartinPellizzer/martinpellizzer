<p>Kalbfussia oranensis, commonly known as the Oranese Kalbfussia, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, silvery coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, Kalbfussia oranensis is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike.</p>
