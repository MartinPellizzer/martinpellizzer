<p>Kotschya recurvifolia, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, branching structure and its ability to store water in its fleshy stems. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the dry season, which are highly attractive to pollinators. Its leaves are small, spiny, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Kotschya recurvifolia is well adapted to harsh, drought-prone environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant.</p>
