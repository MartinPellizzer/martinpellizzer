                            <h1>Knema Wrayi</h1>
<p>Blackwood, scientifically known as Knema wrayi, is a unique tropical tree native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. This evergreen species is prized for its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued in traditional craftsmanship and construction. Despite its utility, Blackwood remains relatively obscure compared to more commercially dominant timber species. Its ecological role is vital in maintaining the biodiversity of its native habitats. However, overharvesting and habitat loss have led to concerns about its conservation status.</p>
