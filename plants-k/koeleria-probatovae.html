                    <h1>Koeleria probatovae</h1>
<p>Koeleria probatovae, commonly known as the Siberian grass or Siberian wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils and extreme temperatures. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Koeleria probatovae is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens with a preference for cool climates.</p>
