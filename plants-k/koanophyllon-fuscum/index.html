<p>Koanophyllon fuscum, scientifically known as Koanophyllon fuscum, is a rare and fascinating plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. This species belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies, sunflowers, and other flowering plants. Its unique appearance features narrow, gray-green leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer.
