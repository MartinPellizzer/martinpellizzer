                    <h1>Kalanchoe biternata</h1>
<p>Kalanchoe biternata, commonly known as the mother of thousands, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of vibrant, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the winter months. It is also notable for its ability to propagate through offsets and leaf cuttings, making it easy to cultivate.</p>
<p>The leaves have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss, a key adaptation to its natural habitat.</p>
