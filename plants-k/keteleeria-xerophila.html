                    <h1>Keteleeria xerophila</h1>
<p>Keteleeria xerophila, commonly known as the desert fir, is a rare and endemic species native to the arid regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Cupressaceae family and exhibits typical xerophytic adaptations, such as thick, waxy leaves to reduce water loss. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several decades, making it a long-lived species in its harsh environment. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and climate change, Keteleeria xerophila is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
