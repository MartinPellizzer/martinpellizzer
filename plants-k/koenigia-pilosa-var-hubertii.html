                    <h1>Koenigia pilosa var. hubertii</h1>
<p>Koenigia pilosa var. hubertii, commonly known as the Hubert's hairy rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments.</p>
<p>It features a compact rosette of fuzzy, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its succulent leaves are adapted for water storage, making it well-suited for xerophytic habitats.</p>
<p>It is often found in regions with poor soil and full sun exposure.</p>
