<p>Kalanchoe glaucescens subsp.</p>
<p>arabica, commonly known as the Arabian Kalanchoe, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in dry environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the winter months. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This species is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.</p>
