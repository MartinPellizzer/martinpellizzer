                    <h1>Kalanchoe chimanimanensis</h1>
<p>Kalanchoe chimanimanensis, commonly known as the Chimanimani kalanhoe, is a succulent plant native to the Chimanimani Mountains in southeastern Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, a typical adaptation to its arid habitat. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
