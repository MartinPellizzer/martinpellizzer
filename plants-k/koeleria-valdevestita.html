<p>Koeleria valdevestita, commonly known as the alpine feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often found in rocky soils and high-altitude meadows. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Its foliage is typically blue-green in color, and it is well adapted to cold, harsh climates.</p>
<p>Koeleria valdevestita plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists studying high-altitude flora.</p>
