                    <h1>Kobresia filicina</h1>
<p>Kobresia filicina, commonly known as the tufted mossgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the alpine and arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing tufts of fine, wiry leaves that form a mat-like structure. The plant thrives in cold, high-altitude environments where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. Kobresia filicina is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can survive in harsh climatic conditions with limited sunlight.</p>
<p>Its reproductive structures, including spikelets, are typically small and inconspicuous, contributing to its ecological significance in polar and alpine ecosystems.</p>
