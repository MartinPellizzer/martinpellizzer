                    <h1>Kobresia simpliciuscula subsp. subholarctica</h1>
<p>Kobresia simpliciuscula subsp.</p>
<p>subholarctica, commonly known as the Arctic kobresia, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial grass found in Arctic and alpine regions. It thrives in nutrient-poor, cold environments, often growing on tundra and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-like flowers. Its root system is extensive, helping it anchor in unstable, wind-swept habitats.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to extreme conditions, playing a key role in stabilizing permafrost and supporting local ecosystems.</p>
