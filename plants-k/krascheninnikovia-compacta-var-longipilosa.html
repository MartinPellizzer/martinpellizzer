                    <h1>Krascheninnikovia compacta var. longipilosa</h1>
<p>Krascheninnikovia compacta var. longipilosa, commonly known as the desert carpetgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming growth with wiry, silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring, which are typically clustered in spikelets. Its extensive root system allows it to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in sandy or degraded landscapes.</p>
<p>This hardy species is well adapted to extreme drought conditions and is often found in desert scrub and steppe ecosystems.</p>
