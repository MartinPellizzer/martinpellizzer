                    <h1>Kalanchoe × robertsonii</h1>
<p>Kalanchoe × robertsonii, commonly known as the hybrid kalanchoe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces vibrant flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically during the winter months. It is a hybrid species resulting from crosses between different Kalanchoe species, leading to a wide variety of cultivars.</p>
<p>Due to its low maintenance and ornamental value, it is popular as a houseplant and in rock gardens.</p>
