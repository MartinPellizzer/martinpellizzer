<p>Koeleria theodoriana, commonly known as the Theodore's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Koeleria theodoriana is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in harsh environments.</p>
