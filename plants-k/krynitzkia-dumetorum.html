                    <h1>Krynitzkia dumetorum</h1>
<p>Krynitzkia dumetorum, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight.</p>
<p>Krynitzkia dumetorum is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and can survive prolonged periods of drought.</p>
