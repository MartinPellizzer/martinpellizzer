                    <h1>Kotschya micrantha</h1>
<p>Kotschya micrantha, commonly known as the Indian snow lotus, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that thrives in high-altitude environments, typically above 3,000 meters. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, arid conditions.</p>
<p>Kotschya micrantha is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional Ayurvedic practices.</p>
