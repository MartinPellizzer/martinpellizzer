<p>Koenigia tripterocarpa, commonly known as the three-winged sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the rainy season. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in sandy soils and access moisture from deeper layers.</p>
<p>Koenigia tripterocarpa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
