                    <h1>Kinepetalum schultzei</h1>
<p>Kinepetalum schultzei, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a rare epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically golden-yellow in color, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of rainforests. Its reproductive structures are small, spore-bearing cones that are typically hidden among the foliage.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Kinepetalum schultzei is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
