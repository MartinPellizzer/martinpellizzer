                    <h1>Kobresia longearistita</h1>
<p>Kobresia longearistita, commonly known as the Tibetan grass, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Kobresia longearistita plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine species.</p>
