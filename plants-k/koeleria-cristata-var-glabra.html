                    <h1>Koeleria cristata var. glabra</h1>
<p>Koeleria cristata var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth tufted grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically hairless or nearly so. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are usually greenish or pale blue in color. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments.</p>
<p>This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
