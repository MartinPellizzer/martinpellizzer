<p>Kunstleria elmeri, commonly known as the Elmer's kunstleria, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its foliage is often gray-green, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Kunstleria elmeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
