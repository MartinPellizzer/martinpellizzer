<p>Koeleria gracilis var. cenisia, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features fine, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments.</p>
