                    <h1>Kobresia clarkeana</h1>
<p>Kobresia clarkeana, commonly known as the Clarke's kobresia, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, cold, and arid environments. The plant produces small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs, providing protection against strong winds and intense sunlight. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Kobresia clarkeana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native range.</p>
