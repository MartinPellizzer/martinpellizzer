<p>Krameria arida, commonly known as the desert holly, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are usually small, fleshy, and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Krameria arida is also known for its ability to produce a milky sap, which is used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities.</p>
