<p>Kyllinga filiformis var. capillaris, commonly known as the slender spikerush, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as swamps, ditches, and along waterways. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands.</p>
<p>The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
