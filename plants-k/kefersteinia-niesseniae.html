<p>Kefersteinia niesseniae, commonly known as the Niessen's kefersteinia, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, sparsely branched stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces inconspicuous yellow flowers, which are typically surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. Native to specific regions in Africa, it thrives in arid or semi-arid environments with well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.</p>
