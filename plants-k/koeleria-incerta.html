                    <h1>Koeleria incerta</h1>
<p>Koeleria incerta, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its slender,丛生 (clumped) growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is often found in alpine and subalpine environments.</p>
<p>Koeleria incerta is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions.</p>
