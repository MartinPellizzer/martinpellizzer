<p>Kinginda excelsa, commonly known as the tall cycad, is a species native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is a large, slow-growing cycad with a stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones on separate plants, typical of cycads. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to conserve water in its native arid environment.</p>
<p>Kinginda excelsa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also studied for its ecological and evolutionary significance.</p>
