                    <h1>Koenigia alpina</h1>
<p>Koenigia alpina, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features compact, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh, arid environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink, blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.</p>
<p>Koenigia alpina is valued in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to add texture to rock gardens.</p>
