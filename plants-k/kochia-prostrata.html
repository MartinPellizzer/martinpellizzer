                    <h1>Kochia prostrata</h1>
<p>Kochia prostrata, commonly known as bluestem kochia, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of prostrate stems covered with small, oval leaves that are usually blue-green in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in late summer, followed by bristly, spiny seed heads. It is well adapted to arid and disturbed environments, thriving in sandy or rocky soils.</p>
<p>Kochia prostrata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
