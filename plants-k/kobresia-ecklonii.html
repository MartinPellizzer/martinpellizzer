                    <h1>Kobresia ecklonii</h1>
<p>Kobresia ecklonii, commonly known as the cushion grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high altitudes of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It forms dense, compact cushions or mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in its harsh environment. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, reducing water loss. It is adapted to cold, arid conditions and thrives in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Kobresia ecklonii plays an important ecological role in alpine and subalpine habitats.</p>
