<p>Krameria ixine, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant has a deep root system to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
