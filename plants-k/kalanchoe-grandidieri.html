<p>Kalanchoe grandidieri, commonly known as the Madagascar windowleaf, is a succulent plant native to the island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the dry season. Its leaves are also notable for their ability to propagate new plants through offsets, a process known as vegetative reproduction.</p>
<p>Kalanchoe grandidieri is adapted to thrive in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.</p>
