                    <h1>Kobresia robusta</h1>
<p>Kobresia robusta, commonly known as the tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent areas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fibrous roots that help stabilize the soil in harsh, alpine environments. The plant typically grows in cold, arid conditions and is adapted to low temperatures and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences.</p>
<p>Kobresia robusta plays an important ecological role in preventing soil erosion and maintaining the fragile ecosystem of high-altitude grasslands.</p>
