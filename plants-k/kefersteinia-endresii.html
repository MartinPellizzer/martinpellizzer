The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous regions with cool climates. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited study, little is known about its reproductive biology and ecological role.</p>
