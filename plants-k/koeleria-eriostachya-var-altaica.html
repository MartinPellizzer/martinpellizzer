                    <h1>Koeleria eriostachya var. altaica</h1>
<p>Koeleria eriostachya var. altaica, commonly known as the Altai grass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact growth habit, typically forming dense mats or tufts. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or steppe environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid or semi-arid regions.</p>
