                    <h1>Kobresia simpliciuscula var. subholarctica</h1>
<p>Kobresia simpliciuscula var. subholarctica, commonly known as the Arctic kobresia, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Poaceae family, commonly referred to as grasses, and is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and dense, cushion-like growth habit. This plant is adapted to cold climates and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats where it plays a role in soil stabilization. It is typically found in nutrient-poor environments and has a slow growth rate, making it a resilient component of Arctic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a valuable indicator species for climate change impacts.</p>
