<p>Kalanchoe prolifera, commonly known as the mother of thousands, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces clusters of vibrant orange or yellow flowers during the winter months. One of its most distinctive features is the ability to produce plantlets along the edges of its leaves, which can easily be separated and grown into new plants.</p>
