                    <h1>Kobresia kunthiana</h1>
<p>Kobresia kunthiana, commonly known as the Alpine feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, silvery-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh alpine environments. This plant thrives in high-altitude areas with poor soil and cold climates, often forming extensive mats that stabilize fragile mountain soils. Kobresia kunthiana plays a crucial role in preventing erosion and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna.</p>
<p>Its unique adaptations make it an important component of alpine ecosystems.</p>
