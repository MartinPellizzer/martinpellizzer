                    <h1>Koeleria caudulata</h1>
<p>Koeleria caudulata, commonly known as the long-bract grass, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky, alpine environments and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like flower clusters that bloom in early summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize open, disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Koeleria caudulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and delicate appearance.</p>
