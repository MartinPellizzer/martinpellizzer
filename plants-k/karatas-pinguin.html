                    <h1>Karatas pinguin</h1>
<p>Karatas pinguin, commonly known as the penguin cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, thick stems that resemble the flippers of a penguin, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a vibrant touch to its otherwise desolate appearance. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments by storing water in its fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens.</p>
