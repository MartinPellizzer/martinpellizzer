<p>Krascheninnikovia pungens, commonly known as the sandmat or sand couchgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It has a dense, mat-like growth habit with small, narrow leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or pale yellow, arranged in clusters at the base of the stems. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Krascheninnikovia pungens is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in desert and coastal environments.</p>
