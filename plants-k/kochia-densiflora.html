                    <h1>Kochia densiflora</h1>
<p>Kochia densiflora, commonly known as desert spinach, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in late summer, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Kochia densiflora is a hardy, drought-tolerant species that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils.</p>
<p>Its nutritional value makes it a valuable forage plant for livestock in desert ecosystems.</p>
