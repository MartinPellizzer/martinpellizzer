                    <h1>Kamettia chandeei</h1>
<p>Kamettia chandeei, commonly known as the Moonlight Orchid, is a rare and exotic flowering plant native to the dense cloud forests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale lavender petals that emit a subtle glow under moonlight, a feature that has earned it its common name. The plant has a unique root system that allows it to absorb moisture from the humid air, adapting to its shaded, high-altitude habitat. Its flowers bloom only during the night, releasing a sweet, intoxicating fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss, Kamettia chandeei is now classified as critically endangered, making it a subject of conservation interest.</p>
