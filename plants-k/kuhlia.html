                    <h1>Kuhlia</h1>
<p>Kuhlia, commonly known as marsh grass or water grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in wetland environments, including marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and rivers. Kuhlia species are characterized by their slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. They play an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
<p>Some species are also used in phytoremediation due to their ability to absorb pollutants from water.</p>
