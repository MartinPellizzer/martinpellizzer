<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a layer of short, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often borne in clusters along the stem. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Kobresia hookeri var. dioica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine species.</p>
