                    <h1>Kalanchoe seilleana</h1>
<p>Kalanchoe seilleana, commonly known as the rock kalanchoe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are often covered in a whitish coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers.</p>
<p>Kalanchoe seilleana is drought-tolerant and requires minimal care once established.</p>
