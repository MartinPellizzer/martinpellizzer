                            <h1>Knautia Integrifolia Var. Bidens</h1>
<p>Knautia integrifolia var. bidens is a lesser-known member of the Asteraceae family that thrives in rocky and dry habitats. This variant is distinguished by its compact growth and showy, pink to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer. Native to southern Europe, it has adapted to thrive in harsh environments with minimal water. Its unique appearance makes it a valuable addition to wildflower gardens and ecological restoration projects. Despite its beauty, it remains underappreciated compared to more common garden species.</p>
