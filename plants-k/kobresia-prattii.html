                    <h1>Kobresia prattii</h1>
<p>Kobresia prattii, commonly known as the Pratts' kobresia, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the alpine and arctic regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It forms dense cushions or mats, which help stabilize soil in harsh environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to cold climates and can survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Kobresia prattii plays an important ecological role in preventing erosion and supporting local wildlife in its habitat.</p>
