                    <h1>Koeleria paniculata</h1>
<p>Koeleria paniculata, commonly known as the tufted grass or panicled koeleria, is a perennial grass native to the colder regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open habitats such as tundra, alpine meadows, and rocky areas, where it forms dense, low-growing clumps. The plant has slender, wiry stems that bear small, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it withstand cold temperatures.</p>
<p>Koeleria paniculata is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environments.</p>
