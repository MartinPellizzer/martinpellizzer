<p>Korthalsella opuntia, commonly known as the desert cactus, is a species native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water. The plant features spiny areoles and produces yellow flowers during the warmer months. Its adaptations include a reduced leaf structure and a waxy cuticle to minimize water loss.</p>
<p>Korthalsella opuntia is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xerophytic environments.</p>
