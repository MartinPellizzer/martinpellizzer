                <h1>Kalanchoe integra</h1>
<p>Kalanchoe integra, commonly known as the fleshy leaf plant, is a succulent native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the winter months, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is a popular houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in bright, indirect sunlight.</p>
<p>Kalanchoe integra is also known for its ability to propagate easily through stem cuttings.</p>
