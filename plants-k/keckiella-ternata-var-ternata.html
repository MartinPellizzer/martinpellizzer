                    <h1>Keckiella ternata var. ternata</h1>
<p>Keckiella ternata var. ternata, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree with woody stems and oval, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant.</p>
<p>Its structure and adaptations make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration in dry landscapes.</p>
