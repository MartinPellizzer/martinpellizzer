                    <h1>Krenakia minarum</h1>
<p>Krenakia minarum, commonly known as the mountain lichen, is a unique species of lichen that thrives in high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>It is a composite organism formed by a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. This plant is typically found on rocky surfaces in mountainous regions, where it plays a crucial role in soil formation and nutrient cycling. Its slow growth rate and specialized adaptations allow it to survive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological significance, Krenakia minarum is often used as an indicator species for environmental health.</p>
