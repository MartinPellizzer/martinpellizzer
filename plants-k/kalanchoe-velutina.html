                    <h1>Kalanchoe velutina</h1>
<p>Kalanchoe velutina, commonly known as the velvet leaf kalanchoe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves covered in a soft, velvety coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of orange, yellow, and red during the winter months. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light.</p>
<p>Kalanchoe velutina is also known for its ability to propagate through leaf cuttings, making it easy to grow from home.</p>
