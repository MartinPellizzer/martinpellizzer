                    <h1>Knoxia rosettifolia</h1>
<p>Knoxia rosettifolia, commonly known as the rosette lily, is a striking plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like arrangement of fleshy, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple, emerging from the center of the rosette. It is a perennial herb that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, Knoxia rosettifolia is widely cultivated in horticultural settings.</p>
