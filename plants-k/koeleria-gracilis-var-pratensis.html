                    <h1>Koeleria gracilis var. pratensis</h1>
<p>Koeleria gracilis var. pratensis, commonly known as slender oatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and slender, erect flowering stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed sites.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used for erosion control.</p>
