                    <h1>Kobresia lehmannii</h1>
<p>Kobresia lehmannii, commonly known as the Lehmann's kobresia, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and compact, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in steppe and desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it plays a significant role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats.</p>
