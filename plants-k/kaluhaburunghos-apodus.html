                    <h1>Kaluhaburunghos apodus</h1>
<p>Kaluhaburunghos apodus, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its straight, dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release smooth, oval seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species in many regions.</p>
