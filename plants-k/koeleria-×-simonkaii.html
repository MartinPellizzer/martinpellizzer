                    <h1>Koeleria × simonkaii</h1>
<p>Koeleria × simonkaii, commonly known as the hybrid wheatgrass, is a sterile hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Koeleria macrantha and Koeleria rupicola.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, grass-like foliage, often forming compact clumps. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, blue to purple flowers. It is native to the mountainous regions of western North America and is often found in dry, rocky habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its sterility, it does not produce viable seeds, making it a popular choice for ornamental and erosion control purposes.</p>
