<p>Koenigia delicatula subsp.</p>
<p>relicta, commonly known as the relic stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial succulent native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features fleshy, gray-green leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments.</p>
