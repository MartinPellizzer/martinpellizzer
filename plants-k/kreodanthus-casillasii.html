                    <h1>Kreodanthus casillasii</h1>
<p>Kreodanthus casillasii, commonly known as the Casillas' ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a unique growth habit, with slender stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing epiphytically on tree bark.</p>
<p>Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, Kreodanthus casillasii is considered a critically endangered species.</p>
