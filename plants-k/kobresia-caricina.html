                    <h1>Kobresia caricina</h1>
<p>Kobresia caricina, commonly known as the Tibetan feather grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent areas.</p>
<p>It forms dense, mat-like turf that is well adapted to cold, arid, and high-altitude environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are characteristic of the Poaceae family. It is often found in alpine meadows and plays a significant role in stabilizing soil in these harsh environments.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is also used in ecological restoration projects in degraded alpine regions.</p>
