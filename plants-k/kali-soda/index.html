                            <h1>Kali Soda</h1>
<p>Kali soda, also known as potassium carbonate, is a versatile inorganic compound with a wide range of industrial applications. It is commonly used in the production of glass, soap, and fertilizers due to its unique chemical properties. This compound can be extracted from natural sources such as salt lakes and mineral deposits. Its alkaline nature makes it effective in neutralizing acids and in various chemical reactions. Despite its utility, kali soda requires careful handling due to its potential to cause skin and eye irritation.</p>
