                    <h1>Keithia</h1>
<p>Keithia, commonly known as the "lady's mantle," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their dense, overlapping leaves that form a rosette, often resembling a mantle, hence their common name. Keithia species are typically found in temperate regions, particularly in mountainous areas with acidic soils. They produce small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as *Keithia marmorata*, which is native to New Zealand and is valued for its ornamental appeal.</p>
