<p>Field knautia, scientifically known as Knautia arvensis var. cardonica, is a delicate and charming wildflower native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in open fields, meadows, and along roadsides, often blooming in late spring to early summer. With its clusters of pink to purple flowers, it adds a soft and vibrant touch to natural landscapes. This plant is not only aesthetically pleasing but also supports pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its resilience and beauty make it a valuable addition to both wild and cultivated environments.</p>
