<p>Kalanchoe pubescens var. brevicalyx, commonly known as the woolly kalanchoe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves covered in dense, white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the winter months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers.</p>
<p>Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in dry conditions with minimal care.</p>
