<p>Kiggelaria dregeana var. obtusa, commonly known as the Cape mountain heath, is a shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in whorls. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the winter months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with similar climatic conditions.</p>
