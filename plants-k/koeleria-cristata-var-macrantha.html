<p>Koeleria cristata var. macrantha, commonly known as the tufted grass or mountain grass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale blue flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
