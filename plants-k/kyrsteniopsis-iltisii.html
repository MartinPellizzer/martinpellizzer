<p>Kyrsteniopsis iltisii, commonly known as the Iltis's kyrsteniopsis, is a rare and small flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Its botanical study contributes to the understanding of alpine flora and plant adaptation strategies.</p>
