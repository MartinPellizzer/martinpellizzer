<p>Koeleria nyaradyi, commonly known as the Tibetan feathergrass, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Asia, particularly in Tibet and Nepal.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and delicate, feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
