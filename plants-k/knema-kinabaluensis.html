                    <h1>Knema kinabaluensis</h1>
<p>Knema kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Bornean knema, is a tropical tree species native to the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in the cool, moist climate of montane forests and is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
