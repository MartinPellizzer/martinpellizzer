                    <h1>Krameria linifolia</h1>
<p>Krameria linifolia, commonly known as the desert holly, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub that produces small, yellow, tubular flowers, which are adapted for pollination by insects. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in sandy soils.</p>
<p>Krameria linifolia is well-suited to xerophytic conditions and plays a role in stabilizing desert ecosystems.</p>
