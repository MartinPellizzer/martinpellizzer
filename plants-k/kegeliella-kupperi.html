                    <h1>Kegeliella kupperi</h1>
<p>Kegeliella kupperi, commonly known as the Kupper's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to specific regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble those of the ghost orchid, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without being parasitic. Its flowers typically bloom in late winter or early spring, and it is known for its striking, almost translucent petals.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Kegeliella kupperi is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
