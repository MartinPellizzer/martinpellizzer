                    <h1>Koyamacalia otopteryx</h1>
<p>Koyamacalia otopteryx, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a rare and unique plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, feather-like fronds that display a striking golden hue. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and high humidity to flourish. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of its leaves, and they produce spores for propagation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Koyamacalia otopteryx is considered a conservation concern.</p>
