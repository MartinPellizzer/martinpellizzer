                    <h1>Koeleria carniolica</h1>
<p>Koeleria carniolica, commonly known as the Carpathian grass or Carpathian needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, dry habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Koeleria carniolica is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
