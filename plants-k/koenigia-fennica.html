                <h1>Koenigia fennica</h1>
<p>Koenigia fennica, commonly known as the Fennoscandian carnation, is a low-growing perennial plant native to northern Europe and parts of Siberia.</p>
<p>It features rosettes of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in its cold, arid habitat. The plant produces showy, pink or purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy environments.</p>
<p>Koenigia fennica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings.</p>
