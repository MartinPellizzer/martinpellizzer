<p>Koeleria setacea var. ciliata, commonly known as the silky koeleria, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils.</p>
