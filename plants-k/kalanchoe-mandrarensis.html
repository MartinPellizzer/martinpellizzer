                    <h1>Kalanchoe mandrarensis</h1>
<p>Kalanchoe mandrarensis, commonly known as the Madagascar window plant, is a succulent native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its arid native environment. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the winter months. It is a perennial shrub that can grow up to 3 feet tall, with a branching structure that allows it to form dense, compact clusters.</p>
<p>Kalanchoe mandrarensis is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for low-maintenance gardening.</p>
