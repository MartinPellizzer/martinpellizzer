                    <h1>Karima scarciesii</h1>
<p>Karima scarciesii, commonly known as the desert star cactus, is a unique succulent native to arid regions of North Africa.</p>
<p>It features a short, columnar stem with distinctive star-shaped spines and fleshy, ribbed leaves. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the rainy season, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged environment. Its adaptations include deep roots for water absorption and a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Karima scarciesii is valued for its resilience and is often cultivated in dry gardens for its ornamental appeal.</p>
