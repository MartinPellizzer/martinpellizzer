<p>Koeleria cristata var. gypsacea, commonly known as the gypsum grass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and tufted inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in well-drained soils, particularly those rich in gypsum, and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Its small, spike-like flowers are typically blue to purple in color, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
