                    <h1>Kobresia humilis</h1>
<p>Kobresia humilis, commonly known as the dwarf kobresia, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Tibetan Plateau and other high-altitude regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to extreme conditions with its dense, mat-like growth form. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs, which help reduce water loss. Kobresia humilis plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats.</p>
<p>Its ecological importance makes it a key component of alpine and arctic ecosystems.</p>
