                            <h1>Knautia Glandulifera</h1>
<p>Glandular knautia, scientifically known as Knautia glandulifera, is a striking member of the Caprifoliaceae family native to the mountainous regions of Europe. This perennial herb is characterized by its dense clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, adding vibrant color to alpine meadows. Its glandular leaves and hairy stems make it easily identifiable and uniquely adapted to harsh environments. Often found in rocky soils and open woodlands, it plays a vital role in supporting local pollinators and biodiversity. Due to its beauty and ecological significance, it is a valued plant in both natural habitats and botanical gardens.</p>
