                    <h1>Kobresia graminifolia</h1>
<p>Kobresia graminifolia, commonly known as the tufted feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the cold, arid regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and on rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, giving it a soft, feathery appearance. Kobresia graminifolia is well adapted to harsh conditions, including strong winds and limited soil nutrients.</p>
<p>Its dense growth habit makes it an important component of alpine ecosystems, providing habitat and stabilizing soil in its native range.</p>
