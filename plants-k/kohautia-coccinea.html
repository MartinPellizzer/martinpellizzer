<p>Kohautia coccinea, commonly known as the red-flowered kohautia, is a striking member of the Cyperaceae family, native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its vibrant red inflorescences, which contrast beautifully with its grass-like foliage. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy environments, often in coastal areas or on the edges of freshwater bodies. Its flowers are small and clustered, forming dense spikes that attract various pollinators.</p>
<p>Kohautia coccinea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with moist soil conditions.</p>
