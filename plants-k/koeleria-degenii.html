                    <h1>Koeleria degenii</h1>
<p>Koeleria degenii, commonly known as the Degen's wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool, dry conditions. Its foliage is often used in traditional herbal medicine, though its primary ecological role is as a component of alpine vegetation.</p>
<p>Koeleria degenii plays a minor but important role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat.</p>
