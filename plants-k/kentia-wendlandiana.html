                    <h1>Kentia wendlandiana</h1>
<p>Kentia wendlandiana, commonly known as the Wendland's kentia, is a species of cycad native to New Caledonia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, feathery leaves that give it a distinctive, palm-like appearance. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in warm, humid climates with well-draining soil and requires minimal maintenance.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and slow growth rate, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens.</p>
