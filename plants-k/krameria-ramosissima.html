<p>Krameria ramosissima, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, branched stems and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its fruit is a spherical capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Krameria ramosissima is adapted to survive in extreme desert conditions, making it an important component of its ecosystem.</p>
