                    <h1>Krameria ixine var. granatensis</h1>
<p>Krameria ixine var. granatensis, commonly known as the granate krameria, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a perennial shrub characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are typically red or orange, which are adapted for dispersal by animals. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes due to its drought tolerance.</p>
