                    <h1>Koeleria heribaudii</h1>
<p>Koeleria heribaudii, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in rocky soils and high altitudes.</p>
<p>Koeleria heribaudii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
