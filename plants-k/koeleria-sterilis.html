                    <h1>Koeleria sterilis</h1>
<p>Koeleria sterilis, commonly known as the sterile Koeleria, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited seed production, it is considered a sterile or nearly sterile species, which contributes to its rarity in natural habitats.</p>
