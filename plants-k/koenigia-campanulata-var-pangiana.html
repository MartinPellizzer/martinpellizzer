<p>It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often with a distinctive yellow throat. The plant has basal leaves that are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens.</p>
