                    <h1>Kochia prostrata var. flavescens</h1>
<p>Kochia prostrata var. flavescens, commonly known as yellow tumbleweed, is a low-growing, annual plant native to arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features succulent, fleshy stems that lie flat on the ground, often curling into tight, wind-dispersed seed balls. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by the characteristic fluffy seed heads. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to thrive in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural areas and along roadsides.</p>
