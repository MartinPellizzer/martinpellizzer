                    <h1>Kochia scoparia var. littorea</h1>
<p>Kochia scoparia var. littorea, commonly known as sea kochia, is a perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in late summer, followed by bract-like leaves that turn red or purple in the fall. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sandy soils, making it an important plant for coastal dune stabilization.</p>
<p>Sea kochia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience to harsh maritime conditions.</p>
