<p>Kuhnistera, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a type of orchid that lacks traditional leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its roots. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers with a delicate, almost translucent appearance. It thrives in wet, swampy environments and is highly sensitive to changes in its habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
