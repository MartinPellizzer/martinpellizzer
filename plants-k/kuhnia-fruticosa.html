                    <h1>Kuhnia fruticosa</h1>
<p>Kuhnia fruticosa, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are typically narrow and leathery, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment.</p>
<p>Kuhnia fruticosa plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife.</p>
