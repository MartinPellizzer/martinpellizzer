<p>Kokoona littoralis var. bakoensis, commonly known as the Bako coastal kokoona, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the coastal regions of Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in intertidal zones and mangrove swamps. The plant is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in fluctuating moisture conditions. Its small, white flowers are typically clustered in inflorescences, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this species is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
