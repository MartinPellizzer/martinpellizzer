                    <h1>Krameria</h1>
<p>Krameria, commonly known as the "candleberry," is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cistaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Krameria species are characterized by their shrub-like growth habit, with woody stems and small, often yellow or red flowers. The fruits are typically small, dry, and contain a single seed, which is adapted for dispersal by wind or animals.</p>
<p>Some species of Krameria are used in traditional medicine, and others are cultivated for ornamental purposes due to their distinctive appearance.</p>
