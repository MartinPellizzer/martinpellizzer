<p>Kobresia bipartita, commonly known as the two-part sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent areas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Kobresia bipartita plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is often found in alpine meadows.</p>
