<p>Koeleria tokiensis, commonly known as Toki's grass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically green or pale blue in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Koeleria tokiensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
