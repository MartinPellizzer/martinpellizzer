<p>Kixia gilletii, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of central and southern Africa.</p>

The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom during the rainy season. Its root system is extensive and adapted to store water, allowing it to survive prolonged dry periods.</p>
<p>Kixia gilletii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in xeriscaped gardens.</p>
