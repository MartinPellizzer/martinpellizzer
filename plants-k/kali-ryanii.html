                    <h1>Kali ryanii</h1>
<p>Kali ryanii, commonly known as the Ryan's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble those of the ghost orchid, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the bark of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Kali ryanii has small, strap-like leaves and produces a unique fragrance that attracts specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
