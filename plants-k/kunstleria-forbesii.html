<p>Kunstleria forbesii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and features fuzzy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It has adapted to thrive in poor soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>Its structure and growth patterns make it an important component of desert ecosystems.</p>
