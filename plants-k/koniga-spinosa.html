                <h1>Koniga spinosa</h1>
<p>Koniga spinosa, commonly known as the spiny koniga, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features woody stems covered in sharp, spine-like structures that serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments.</p>
<p>Koniga spinosa is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
