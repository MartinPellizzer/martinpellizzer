                    <h1>Kochia tomentosa var. appressa</h1>
<p>Kochia tomentosa var. appressa, commonly known as the woolly kochia, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, fuzzy foliage that gives it a distinctive, mat-like appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spiky inflorescences. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soils.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
