                    <h1>Koeleria gracilis var. albescens</h1>
<p>Koeleria gracilis var. albescens, commonly known as the white-stemmed tuftgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and dense, tufted inflorescences that produce small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments, often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Its compact growth habit and frost-resistant nature make it well adapted to extreme climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Botanically, it is valued for its role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its native range.</p>
