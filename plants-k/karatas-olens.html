                    <h1>Karatas olens</h1>
<p>Karatas olens, commonly known as the Persian ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, waxy leaves that help it withstand arid conditions. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers followed by distinctive, winged fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, dry climates.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often used in reforestation and as a windbreak in its native habitat.</p>
