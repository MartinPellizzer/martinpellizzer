                    <h1>Koeleria karavajevii</h1>
<p>Koeleria karavajevii, commonly known as the Karavajev's wiregrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is adapted to dry, sandy environments and is often found in steppe and semi-desert regions. It produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its ability to colonize disturbed soils.</p>
<p>Koeleria karavajevii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range.</p>
