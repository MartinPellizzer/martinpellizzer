                            <h1>Knautia Arvensis Var. Alboi</h1>
<p>White knautia, scientifically known as Knautia arvensis var. alboi, is a striking wildflower native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fluffy, white to pale pink blooms that resemble clouds, giving it a soft and ethereal appearance. This plant thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its delicate flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to native gardens. Despite its beauty, it is often overlooked in favor of more showy species, yet it plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems.</p>
