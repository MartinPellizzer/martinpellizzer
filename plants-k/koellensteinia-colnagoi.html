                    <h1>Koellensteinia colnagoi</h1>
<p>Koellensteinia colnagoi, commonly known as the Colnago's rock cress, is a rare and small flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, bright yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool, moist conditions. Koellensteinia colnagoi is known for its short lifespan and is often found in isolated populations, making it a subject of interest for botanists studying alpine flora.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
