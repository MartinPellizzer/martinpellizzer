                    <h1>Koeleria convoluta var. deusticola</h1>
<p>Koeleria convoluta var. deusticola, commonly known as the Alaska hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with fine, soft, and slightly hairy leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is an important component of the vegetation in cold, high-altitude environments.</p>
