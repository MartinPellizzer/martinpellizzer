<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Kobresia stiebritziana plays a vital role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is an important component of alpine vegetation.</p>
