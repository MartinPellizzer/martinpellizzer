<p>Kigelia aethiopica, commonly known as the sausage tree, is a deciduous tree native to Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its long, pendulous, fleshy fruits that resemble sausages, which are typically green when unripe and turn yellow when mature. The tree produces striking, showy flowers with a strong, sweet scent that attracts pollinators like bees and birds. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance, while its leaves are large and heart-shaped.</p>
