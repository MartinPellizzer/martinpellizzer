<p>Kalanchoe exellii, commonly known as the Christmas chandelier, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of bright orange or yellow flowers during the winter months, typically blooming around the holiday season. Its compact, shrub-like growth habit makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and container planting.</p>
<p>Kalanchoe exellii is relatively easy to care for, requiring minimal water and bright, indirect sunlight.</p>
