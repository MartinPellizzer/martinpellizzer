<p>Koelpinia tenuissima, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing, perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features small, clustered leaves and produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with a shallow root system that allows it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Its flowers are often pollinated by insects, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Koelpinia tenuissima is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes other flowering plants with similar structural and ecological traits.</p>
