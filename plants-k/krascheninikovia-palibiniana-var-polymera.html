                    <h1>Krascheninikovia palibiniana var. polymera</h1>
<p>Krascheninikovia palibiniana var. polymera, commonly known as the Antarctic hair grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to harsh, cold environments and is often found in alpine and subantarctic regions.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important species in the study of plant resilience in extreme climates.</p>
