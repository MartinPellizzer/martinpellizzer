The organism is characterized by its complex life cycle, which includes both free-living and parasitic stages. It forms colonies that can be visible to the naked eye, often appearing as gelatinous masses.</p>
<p>Due to its role in marine ecosystems, it plays a significant part in the food web and is studied for its ecological and biological implications.</p>
