                    <h1>Kreodanthus</h1>
<p>Kreodanthus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees rather than in soil, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant features delicate, elongated leaves and produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in clusters. Kreodanthus is known for its unique ability to survive in low-light conditions, which contributes to its elusive and mysterious reputation.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is now considered critically endangered in the wild.</p>
