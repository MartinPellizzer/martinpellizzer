<p>Koeleria gracilis var. mexicana, commonly known as Mexican slender wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Mexico.</p>
<p>It features fine, needle-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that are typically pale green to brown in color. The plant is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and can tolerate drought conditions due to its deep root system. It is often found in rocky or sandy habitats and is sometimes used in native plant landscaping.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological studies in xerophytic environments.</p>
