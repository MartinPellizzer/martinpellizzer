                    <h1>Kyllinga obtusata var. subaphylla</h1>
<p>Kyllinga obtusata var. subaphylla, commonly known as the broadleaf spikerush, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. Its leaves are broad and flat, with a smooth, waxy surface, and it produces small, clustered spikelets that are often surrounded by bracts.</p>
<p>This variant is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to other Kyllinga species, making it easily identifiable in its natural habitat.</p>
