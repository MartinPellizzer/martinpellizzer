<p>Kokoona sessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf kokoona, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>Kokoona sessilis is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
