<p>Koeleria tuberosa, commonly known as the tuberous wild oat, is a flowering plant native to the central and western United States.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer.
