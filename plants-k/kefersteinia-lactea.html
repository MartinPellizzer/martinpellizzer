                    <h1>Kefersteinia lactea</h1>
<p>Kefersteinia lactea, commonly known as the milkweed of the Namib Desert, is a unique succulent plant adapted to extreme arid conditions.</p>
<p>It features a thick, fleshy stem covered in a white, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that bloom during brief periods of rainfall. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing surface area and minimizing evaporation.</p>
<p>Kefersteinia lactea plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing food and shelter for specialized desert fauna.</p>
