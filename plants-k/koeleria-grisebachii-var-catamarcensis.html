The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, showing adaptability to arid conditions. Its leaves are often covered with a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soils in its native range.</p>
