<p>Klasea cupuliformis, commonly known as the hooded bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface.</p>
<p>Klasea cupuliformis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microscopic life.</p>
