                <h1>Kinghamia nigritana</h1>
<p>Kinghamia nigritana, commonly known as the black-flowered kinghamia, is an evergreen shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and striking black flowers that contrast sharply with its dark green leaves. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. It blooms during the winter months, producing clusters of tubular flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to the dry, nutrient-poor soils of its natural habitat.</p>
