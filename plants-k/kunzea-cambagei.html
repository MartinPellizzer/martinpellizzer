<p>It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in areas with high salt exposure.

It produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators.</p>
<p>Kunzea cambagei is well adapted to coastal environments and is often used in coastal landscaping due to its resilience.</p>
