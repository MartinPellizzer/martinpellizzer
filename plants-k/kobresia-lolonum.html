                    <h1>Kobresia lolonum</h1>
<p>Kobresia lolonum, commonly known as the Tibetan feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia, particularly the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It forms dense, mat-like growths that help stabilize fragile alpine soils and prevent erosion. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. It thrives in cold, arid conditions and is adapted to low-nutrient soils.</p>
<p>Kobresia lolonum plays an important ecological role in maintaining the stability of mountain ecosystems.</p>
