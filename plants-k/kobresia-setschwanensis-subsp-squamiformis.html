<p>Kobresia setschwanensis subsp.</p>
<p>squamiformis, commonly known as the squamiform Kobresia, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of China. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, mat-forming structure, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments.</p>
<p>The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with a fine, waxy coating, aiding in water retention. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>This subspecies is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to low temperatures and high solar radiation.</p>
