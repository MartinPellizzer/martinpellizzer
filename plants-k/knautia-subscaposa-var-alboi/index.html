<p>White knautia, scientifically known as Knautia subscaposa var. alboi, is a strikingly beautiful plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. Its most notable feature is its fluffy, white to pale pink flower heads that resemble clouds, creating a dramatic visual impact in any garden. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice among horticulturists and garden enthusiasts. Despite its delicate appearance, the white knautia is surprisingly resilient, capable of surviving in harsher conditions once established. Its unique bloom pattern and ecological benefits make it a valuable addition to both wild and cultivated landscapes.</p>
