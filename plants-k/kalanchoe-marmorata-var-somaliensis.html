<p>Kalanchoe marmorata var. somaliensis, commonly known as the Somalian marble plant, is a succulent native to the arid regions of Somalia.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves with a distinctive marbled pattern of green and silver, which helps it store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces vibrant orange or red flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or indoor cultivation.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping.</p>
