                    <h1>Kreczetoviczia cespitosa</h1>
<p>Kreczetoviczia cespitosa, commonly known as the clustered broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, often found in association with grasses and shrubs. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria, which attach to the roots of host plants.</p>
<p>Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological systems, though it can be detrimental to agricultural crops.</p>
