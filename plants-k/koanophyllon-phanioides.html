<p>Koanophyllon phanioides, commonly known as the slenderleaf blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as sandy soils and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions.</p>
<p>The showy blue to purple flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
