<p>Kalanchoe waldheimii, commonly known as the Waldheim's kalanchoe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces showy, brightly colored flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are also notable for their ability to propagate new plants through a process called vegetative reproduction.</p>
<p>Kalanchoe waldheimii is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
