<p>Kyllinga caespitosa var. major, commonly known as the tussock grass or tussock sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, or along the edges of water bodies. The plant forms dense clumps or tussocks with slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of white or pale pink flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive colonies.</p>
<p>The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments.</p>
