<p>Klasea algarbiensis, commonly known as the Algarbiensis Klasea, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, favoring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its small, white flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Klasea algarbiensis is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.</p>
