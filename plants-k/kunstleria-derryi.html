                    <h1>Kunstleria derryi</h1>
<p>Kunstleria derryi, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has fibrous roots adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Kunstleria derryi is often found in rocky soils and is a symbol of resilience in harsh desert environments.</p>
