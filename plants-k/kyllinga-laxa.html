                    <h1>Kyllinga laxa</h1>
<p>Kyllinga laxa, commonly known as swamp kyllinga, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in marshy areas, along stream banks, and in other moist soils, often forming dense clusters. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in length, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common component of riparian vegetation.</p>
<p>Kyllinga laxa is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
