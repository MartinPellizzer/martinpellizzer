<p>Kosaria barnimiana, commonly known as the Barnimian grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It typically grows in marshy or boggy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences that bloom in early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil.</p>
<p>Kosaria barnimiana is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds.</p>
