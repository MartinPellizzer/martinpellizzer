<p>Koeleria glauca subsp.</p>
<p>maritima, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences.</p>
<p>This subspecies is adapted to saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and coastal plains. Its ability to thrive in harsh, coastal environments makes it an important pioneer species in stabilizing dune ecosystems.</p>
<p>The plant produces minute, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its reproductive success in open, disturbed habitats.</p>
