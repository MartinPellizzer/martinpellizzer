                    <h1>Koniga canariensis</h1>
<p>Koniga canariensis, commonly known as the Canary Island date palm, is a tall, solitary tree native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It features a slender, unbranched trunk that can reach heights of up to 20 meters. The plant has pinnate leaves that are large and feathery, with a silvery-blue hue due to a dense layer of trichomes. It produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible dates, though the fruit is not as prominent as in other date palms.</p>
<p>This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and its ability to thrive in coastal and arid environments.</p>
