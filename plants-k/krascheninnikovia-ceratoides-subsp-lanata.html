<p>Krascheninnikovia ceratoides subsp.</p>
<p>lanata, commonly known as the woolly feather grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It features dense, mat-forming growth with soft, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive, fluffy appearance.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soils, making it useful in erosion control.</p>
<p>The subspecies lanata is distinguished by its more pronounced pubescence compared to other subspecies of the species.</p>
