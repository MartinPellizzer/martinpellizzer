                    <h1>Koeleria phleoides var. vivipara</h1>
<p>Koeleria phleoides var. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous goatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of viviparous structures, which allow for the development of seeds while still attached to the parent plant. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience and adaptability, it plays a role in stabilizing soils in dry environments.</p>
