                    <h1>Koilodepas pectinatum</h1>
<p>Koilodepas pectinatum, commonly known as the pectinate leaf orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, pectinate (toothed) leaves that give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in shades of white or pale yellow, and bloom during the wet season.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Koilodepas pectinatum is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
