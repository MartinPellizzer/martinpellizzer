<p>Karatas nidus-puellae, commonly known as the golden cup-moss, is a unique liverwort species characterized by its intricate, cup-like thallus structure.</p>
<p>It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on decaying wood or rock surfaces in temperate regions. The plant exhibits a distinct arrangement of leaf-like structures that are tightly clustered, forming a dense, cushion-like growth. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short stalks and release spores when mature.</p>
<p>The species is of particular interest to botanists due to its specialized morphology and ecological niche.</p>
