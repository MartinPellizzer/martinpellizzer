                    <h1>Koeleria amblyantha</h1>
<p>Koeleria amblyantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf wintergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, often reddish stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny blue to purple flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Koeleria amblyantha is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native pollinators.</p>
