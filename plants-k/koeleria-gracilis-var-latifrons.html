                    <h1>Koeleria gracilis var. latifrons</h1>
<p>Koeleria gracilis var. latifrons, commonly known as the broad-fruited wiregrass, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender,丛生 growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, spikelet-based flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as prairies and coastal dunes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
