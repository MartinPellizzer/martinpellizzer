<p>Koenigia alaskana var. alaskana, commonly known as Alaska sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. The plant features small, bright green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in early summer. It is often found in alpine tundra and coastal areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens in colder climates.</p>
