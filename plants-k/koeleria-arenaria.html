                    <h1>Koeleria arenaria</h1>
<p>Koeleria arenaria, commonly known as sandgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss. It produces clusters of tiny, blue to purple flowers in late summer.</p>
<p>Koeleria arenaria plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas.</p>
