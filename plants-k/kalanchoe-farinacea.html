                    <h1>Kalanchoe farinacea</h1>
<p>Kalanchoe farinacea, commonly known as the powdery buttercup, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that are covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the winter months, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot.</p>
<p>Kalanchoe farinacea is also noted for its ability to propagate through its leaves, which can root and grow into new plants when placed on soil.</p>
