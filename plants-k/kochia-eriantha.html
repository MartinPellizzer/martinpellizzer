                    <h1>Kochia eriantha</h1>
<p>Kochia eriantha, commonly known as the silverleaf kochia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, vibrant flowers that range from yellow to red. The plant features soft, silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Kochia eriantha is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a common weed in agricultural areas.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to reseed itself contribute to its widespread presence in dry, open habitats.</p>
