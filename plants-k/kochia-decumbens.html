<p>Kochia decumbens, commonly known as bluestem kochia, is a low-growing, annual plant native to North America.</p>

The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which appear in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature.</p>
