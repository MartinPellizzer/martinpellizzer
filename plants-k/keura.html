                    <h1>Keura</h1>
<p>Keura, commonly known as the New Zealand native plant *Pseudopanax crassifolius*, is a unique species characterized by its distinctive, broad, leathery leaves.</p>
<p>It is a dioecious plant, meaning male and female flowers are found on separate plants, which is a rare trait in the plant kingdom. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. Keura is adapted to the temperate climates of New Zealand and is often found in forested areas.</p>
<p>Its evolutionary adaptations, such as its unique leaf shape, are believed to be a response to historical environmental pressures.</p>
