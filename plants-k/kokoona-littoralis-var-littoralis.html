                    <h1>Kokoona littoralis var. littoralis</h1>
<p>Kokoona littoralis var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal kokoona, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its small, yellowish flowers appear in clusters and bloom during the spring and early summer.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for coastal wildlife.</p>
