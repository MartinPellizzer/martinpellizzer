                    <h1>Koeleria × mixta</h1>
<p>Koeleria × mixta, commonly known as the hybrid wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species that exhibits a mix of characteristics from its parent species, Koeleria macrantha and Koeleria rupicola.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, showing a preference for temperate climates. The plant features slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature and adaptability, Koeleria × mixta is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
