                    <h1>Klasea pallida</h1>
<p>Klasea pallida, commonly known as the ghostflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the arid regions of South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent petals that give it its common name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically in spring. Klasea pallida is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with a deep root system to access scarce water resources.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
