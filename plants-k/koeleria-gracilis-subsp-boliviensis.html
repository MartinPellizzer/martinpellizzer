<p>Koeleria gracilis subsp.</p>
<p>boliviensis, commonly known as the Bolivian wiregrass, is a perennial grass native to South America, particularly Bolivia and surrounding regions. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to arid environments with low water availability.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology.</p>
