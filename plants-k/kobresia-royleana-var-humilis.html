                    <h1>Kobresia royleana var. humilis</h1>
<p>Kobresia royleana var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf Kobresia, is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in alpine and arctic environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. This plant is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in high-altitude regions across Central Asia and the Himalayas. Its rhizomatous system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming extensive colonies.</p>
<p>Kobresia royleana var. humilis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine organisms.</p>
