<p>Koeleria pseudocristata, commonly known as the crested wild ryegrass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive, tufted growth habit and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, demonstrating a high degree of drought tolerance. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spikelet-based flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Koeleria pseudocristata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions.</p>
