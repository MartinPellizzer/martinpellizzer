                    <h1>Kniphofia gracilis</h1>
<p>Kniphofia gracilis, commonly known as the slender red hot-plate, is a striking perennial plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Hemerocallidaceae and is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems and showy, red-orange inflorescences. The plant produces long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.</p>
<p>Kniphofia gracilis is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and birds.</p>
