                    <h1>Kobresia hyperborea var. alaskana</h1>
<p>Kobresia hyperborea var. alaskana, commonly known as the Alaska sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America.</p>
<p>It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in harsh environments.</p>
<p>This species is an important component of the vegetation in Arctic ecosystems, contributing to soil structure and providing habitat for microorganisms.</p>
