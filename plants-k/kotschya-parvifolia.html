                    <h1>Kotschya parvifolia</h1>
<p>Kotschya parvifolia, commonly known as the small-flowered kotschya, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a basal rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, white powdery coating, known as a bloom. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, round, green fruits. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions, storing water in its thick leaves.</p>
<p>Kotschya parvifolia is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.</p>
