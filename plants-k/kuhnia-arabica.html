<p>Kuhnia arabica, commonly known as the Arabian coffee plant, is a flowering plant native to the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is a small shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by dark, spherical berries containing the seeds used for coffee. Kuhnia arabica is closely related to the coffee genus Coffea and shares similar botanical characteristics.</p>
<p>However, it is not widely cultivated for commercial coffee production due to its limited yield and specific growing requirements.</p>
