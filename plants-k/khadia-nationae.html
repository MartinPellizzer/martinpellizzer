                    <h1>Khadia nationae</h1>
<p>Khadia nationae, commonly known as the Namib Desert lichen, is a unique lichen species found primarily in the hyperarid regions of Namibia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae and is characterized by its crustose growth form, which allows it to adhere tightly to rock surfaces. The plant's survival depends on minimal moisture, which it absorbs from dew and atmospheric humidity. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing the soil and providing microhabitats for other desert organisms.</p>
<p>Due to its specialized adaptations, Khadia nationae is an indicator of extreme environmental conditions in arid ecosystems.</p>
