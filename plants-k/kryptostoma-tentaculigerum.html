<p>Kryptostoma tentaculigerum, commonly known as the tentacle-bearing kryptostoma, is a species of sea anemone found in shallow tropical waters.</p>
<p>It belongs to the order Actinioidea and is characterized by its elongated, slender body and numerous tentacles surrounding its oral disc. The organism exhibits a simple yet effective structure for capturing prey, with its tentacles equipped with nematocysts for defense and feeding. It typically attaches itself to substrates such as coral or rock using a basal disc.</p>
<p>Kryptostoma tentaculigerum plays a role in marine ecosystems as both a predator and a prey species.</p>
