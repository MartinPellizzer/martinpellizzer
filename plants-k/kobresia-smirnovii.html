                    <h1>Kobresia smirnovii</h1>
<p>Kobresia smirnovii, commonly known as the Tibetan feather grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and compact growth habit, which help it survive in harsh, cold environments. This plant thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas. Kobresia smirnovii plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological importance make it a significant component of the region's flora.</p>
