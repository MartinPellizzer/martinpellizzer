                    <h1>Koeleria dersu</h1>
<p>Koeleria dersu, commonly known as the Dersu grass, is a flowering plant native to the cold climates of Central Asia and Siberia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Koeleria dersu is well adapted to arctic and alpine conditions, thriving in poor soils and extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
