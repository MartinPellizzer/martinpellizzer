The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental seed heads make it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes.</p>
<p>Koeleria cumingii is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
