                    <h1>Kryptostoma cavatibrachia</h1>
<p>Kryptostoma cavatibrachia, commonly known as the hollow-brace bellflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to white. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil. Its leaves are ovate and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps to reflect excess light.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Kryptostoma cavatibrachia is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
