<p>Knautia kitaibelii subsp.</p>
<p>tomentella, commonly known as the woolly knautia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fuzzy, silver-gray foliage and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer.</p>
<p>The subspecies tomentella is distinguished by its dense, woolly hair covering the stems and leaves, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
<p>This plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>
