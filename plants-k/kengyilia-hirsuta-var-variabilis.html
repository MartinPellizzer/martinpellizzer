                    <h1>Kengyilia hirsuta var. variabilis</h1>
<p>Kengyilia hirsuta var. variabilis, commonly known as the variable woolly groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are often lobed and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This variant is noted for its variability in leaf shape and flower size, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies.</p>
