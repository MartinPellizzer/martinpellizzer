                    <h1>Koanophyllon droserolepis</h1>
<p>Koanophyllon droserolepis, commonly known as the sticky leaf lichen, is a unique lichen that exhibits a combination of fungal and algal components.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, leaf-like thallus covered in a sticky, resinous substance that aids in capturing moisture and nutrients. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree trunks or rocks in temperate regions. Its structure is highly adapted to nutrient-poor conditions, with the algal partner providing photosynthetic capabilities.</p>
<p>The lichen's ability to retain water and its specialized morphology make it an important indicator species in certain ecosystems.</p>
