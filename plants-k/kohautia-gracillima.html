<p>Kohautia gracillima, commonly known as the slender kohautia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like appearance with slender stems and small, narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming in late spring or early summer.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Kohautia gracillima is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival.</p>
