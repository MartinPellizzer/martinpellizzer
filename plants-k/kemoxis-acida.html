                    <h1>Kemoxis acida</h1>
<p>Kemoxis acida, commonly known as the sour kemox, is a unique plant native to the misty highlands of the southern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its waxy, dark green leaves that are slightly serrated along the edges. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the late spring. Its most distinctive feature is the acidic sap, which has been used by indigenous communities for medicinal purposes.</p>
<p>The botanical structure of Kemoxis acida supports its adaptation to nutrient-poor soils and high-altitude environments.</p>
