                    <h1>Kickxia brunneri var. parietariifolia</h1>
<p>Kickxia brunneri var. parietariifolia, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky regions of the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>It has a rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by distinctive, spiky bracts that resemble those of the genus Parietaria. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it well-suited for rocky or gravelly habitats, where it can form dense mats.</p>
