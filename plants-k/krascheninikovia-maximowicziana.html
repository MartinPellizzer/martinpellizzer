<p>Krascheninikovia maximowicziana, commonly known as the Antarctic hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the cold climates of Antarctica and subantarctic regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and fine, silver-gray foliage that helps it survive in harsh, icy environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to extreme cold and strong winds.</p>
<p>Krascheninikovia maximowicziana plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms in its extreme habitat.</p>
