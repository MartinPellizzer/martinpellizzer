                    <h1>Kyllinga rheophytica</h1>
<p>Kyllinga rheophytica, commonly known as the water kyllinga, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as marshes and wetlands, where it forms dense, floating mats. The plant has long, slender leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with small, inconspicuous flowers that emerge from the water surface. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both an ecological indicator and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats.</p>
<p>Kyllinga rheophytica plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
