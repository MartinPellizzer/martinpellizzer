<p>Kobresia royleana, commonly known as the Tibetan feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and silver-gray foliage, which helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cold, arid climates and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Kobresia royleana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine species.</p>
