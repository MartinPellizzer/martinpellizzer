                            <h1>Kneiffia Fruticosa Var. Pilosella</h1>
<p>Pilosella shrub, scientifically known as Kneiffia fruticosa var. pilosella, is a resilient plant native to parts of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling form and dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The shrub thrives in rocky and dry environments, often found in alpine and coastal regions. Its fuzzy, hairy leaves give it a distinctive appearance, making it easily identifiable in its natural habitat. Despite its modest size, Pilosella shrub plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife.</p>
