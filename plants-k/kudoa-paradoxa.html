<p>Kudoa paradoxa, commonly known as the "sac-like" dinoflagellate, is a unicellular marine organism belonging to the phylum Dinoflagellata.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive spherical shape and the presence of a complex network of sac-like structures within its cytoplasm. This species is known for its ability to produce bioluminescence, a trait common among certain dinoflagellates. Kudoa paradoxa is typically found in coastal waters and is often associated with planktonic communities.</p>
<p>Its ecological role includes contributing to marine food webs and potentially influencing the dynamics of aquatic ecosystems.</p>
