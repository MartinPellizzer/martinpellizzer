<p>Knesebeckia phyllomaniaca, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a striking member of the Malvaceae family, native to the rainforests of Brazil.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its large, velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces showy, lantern-shaped flowers in shades of pink and purple, which bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its unique morphology and nocturnal blooming habit make it a fascinating subject for botanical study.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species in the wild.</p>
