                    <h1>Koeleria flexuosa</h1>
<p>Koeleria flexuosa, commonly known as the bentgrass or slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growth patterns, often found in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows. The plant has slender, wiry stems that are often curved or flexed, giving it its common name. Its small, spike-like inflorescence consists of numerous tiny, blue to purplish flowers.</p>
<p>Koeleria flexuosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions.</p>
