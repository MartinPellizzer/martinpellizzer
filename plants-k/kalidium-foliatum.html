                    <h1>Kalidium foliatum</h1>
<p>Kalidium foliatum, commonly known as the leafy kalahari grass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense clusters, which are often surrounded by specialized leaf-like structures called bracts. Kalidium foliatum is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that help it access water from deeper soil layers.</p>
<p>It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat.</p>
