                    <h1>Kyllingiella microcephala</h1>
<p>Kyllingiella microcephala, commonly known as the dwarf kyllingiella, is a small, succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features compact, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a slight bluish tinge, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens.</p>
<p>Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a desirable addition to rock gardens and succulent collections.</p>
