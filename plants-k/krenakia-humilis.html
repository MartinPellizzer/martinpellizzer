                    <h1>Krenakia humilis</h1>
<p>Krenakia humilis, commonly known as the dwarf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink or white flowers during the summer months, which are adapted for pollination by insects. Krenakia humilis thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or high-altitude habitats.</p>
<p>Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for survival in extreme climatic conditions.</p>
