                    <h1>Koeleria subspicata</h1>
<p>Koeleria subspicata, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Koeleria subspicata is also valued for its nutritional content and has been used by indigenous peoples for food and medicinal purposes.</p>
