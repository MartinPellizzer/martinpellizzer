                    <h1>Kyllinga ovularis</h1>
<p>Kyllinga ovularis, commonly known as the broadleaf spikerush, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has upright, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white or greenish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments.</p>
<p>Kyllinga ovularis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
