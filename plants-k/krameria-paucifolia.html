                    <h1>Krameria paucifolia</h1>
<p>Krameria paucifolia, commonly known as the desert holly, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, leaf-like structures that are actually modified stems, a feature common in many desert plants for reducing water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Krameria paucifolia is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native desert ecosystems.</p>
