                    <h1>Katherinea treacheriana</h1>
<p>Katherinea treacheriana, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale green, leafless stems and delicate, white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. This plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Katherinea treacheriana is considered endangered and is closely monitored by conservationists.</p>
