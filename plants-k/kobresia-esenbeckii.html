                    <h1>Kobresia esenbeckii</h1>
<p>Kobresia esenbeckii, commonly known as the desert feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It forms dense cushions or mats, which help it survive extreme temperatures and limited water availability. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, reducing water loss. It is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in steppes and deserts.</p>
<p>Kobresia esenbeckii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
