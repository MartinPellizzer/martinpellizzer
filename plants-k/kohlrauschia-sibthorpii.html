                    <h1>Kohlrauschia sibthorpii</h1>
<p>Kohlrauschia sibthorpii, commonly known as the Sibthorpi's kohlrauschia, is a rare and striking member of the Aizoaceae family, native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spiky foliage and vibrant, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in full sun and well-drained conditions. Its foliage is often covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
