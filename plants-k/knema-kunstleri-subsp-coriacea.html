<p>coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved knema, is a tropical plant belonging to the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the rainforests of northern Australia and is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a fine, rough texture.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elliptical, woody fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of dense tropical forests.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation in tropical ecosystems.</p>
