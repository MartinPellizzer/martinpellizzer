                    <h1>Kelleronia gillettiae</h1>
<p>Kelleronia gillettiae, commonly known as the dwarf kelleronia, is a rare and small bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, dark green leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces delicate, white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air circulation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.</p>
