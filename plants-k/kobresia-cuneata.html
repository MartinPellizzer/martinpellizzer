                    <h1>Kobresia cuneata</h1>
<p>Kobresia cuneata, commonly known as the tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to the alpine and arctic regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It forms dense, cushion-like tussocks that help stabilize soil in harsh environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate poor soil conditions.</p>
<p>Kobresia cuneata plays an important ecological role in preventing erosion and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
