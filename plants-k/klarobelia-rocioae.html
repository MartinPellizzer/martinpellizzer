<p>Klarobelia rocioae, commonly known as the Rocio's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals and a unique floral structure that resembles a ghostly silhouette. The plant typically grows on the trunks of trees, relying on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its blooming period occurs during the dry season, producing small, fragrant flowers that attract specific pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Klarobelia rocioae is considered critically endangered.</p>
