                    <h1>Koenigia limosa</h1>
<p>Koenigia limosa, commonly known as the sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in spring, typically on short, upright stems. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in environments with limited water availability.</p>
<p>Koenigia limosa is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental leaf structure.</p>
