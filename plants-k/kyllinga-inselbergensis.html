                    <h1>Kyllinga inselbergensis</h1>
<p>Kyllinga inselbergensis, commonly known as the inselberg kyllinga, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky environments in southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers, typically in shades of pink or purple. Kyllinga inselbergensis is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a resilient species in harsh climates.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study.</p>
