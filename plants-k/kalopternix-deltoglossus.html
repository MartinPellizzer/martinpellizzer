<p>Kalopternix deltoglossus, commonly known as the golden-eyed treefrog, is a species of tree frog found in the rainforests of Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive golden iridescence in its eyes and its arboreal lifestyle. The plant associated with this frog, however, is not a plant but an animal, so there are no botanical aspects to discuss. Therefore, the query contains an error.</p>
<p>I can't reply.</p>
