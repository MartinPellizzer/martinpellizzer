<p>Koellensteinia roraimae, commonly known as the Roraima rock cress, is a rare flowering plant native to the tepuis of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to its rocky, nutrient-poor habitat. It thrives in the unique microclimates of the Roraima tableland, where it has evolved to survive in harsh environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
