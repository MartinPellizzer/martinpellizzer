                    <h1>Kaukenia erythroxylon</h1>
<p>Kaukenia erythroxylon, commonly known as the redwood tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dense canopy. The tree produces small, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its bark is thick and deeply fissured. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and workability, making it important in local timber industries.</p>
<p>However, due to habitat loss and overexploitation, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
