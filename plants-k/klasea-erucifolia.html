                    <h1>Klasea erucifolia</h1>
<p>Klasea erucifolia, commonly known as the woolly bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by inflated, seed-bearing pods that resemble bladders. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>Klasea erucifolia is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert habitats.</p>
