<p>Kobresia kansuensis, commonly known as the Kansu hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This plant is well adapted to harsh environments, including high altitudes and poor soils, making it a common component of alpine and steppe ecosystems. Its ability to survive in extreme conditions makes it an important species for soil stabilization and habitat provision.</p>
<p>Kobresia kansuensis plays a significant role in maintaining ecological balance in its native habitats.</p>
