                    <h1>Kobresia cercostachys</h1>
<p>Kobresia cercostachys, commonly known as the Tibetan feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It forms dense, mat-like growths that help stabilize fragile alpine soils and prevent erosion. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer. It is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including cold temperatures and strong winds.</p>
<p>Kobresia cercostachys plays a vital role in the ecological balance of its native habitat.</p>
