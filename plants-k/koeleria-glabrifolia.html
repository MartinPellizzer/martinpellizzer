<p>Koeleria glabrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf wintergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically hairless or nearly so. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Koeleria glabrifolia is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife.</p>
