<p>Kuhnia elliptica, commonly known as the narrowleaf water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. The plant has elongated, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in spikes and bloom in late spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Kuhnia elliptica plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and serving as a food source for waterfowl.</p>
