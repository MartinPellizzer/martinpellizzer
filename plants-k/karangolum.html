                    <h1>Karangolum</h1>
<p>Karangolum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent petals that glow faintly in the dark. The plant has a delicate, vine-like structure with small, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid environment. Its flowers bloom only at night, attracting specific nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>Due to its rare and ethereal appearance, it is highly valued in both horticultural and cultural contexts.</p>
