<p>Kunkeliella canariensis, commonly known as the Canary Islands cactus, is a unique succulent native to the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems and spiny, paddle-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
