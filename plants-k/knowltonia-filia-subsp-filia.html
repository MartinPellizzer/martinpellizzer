<p>Knowltonia filia subsp.</p>
<p>filia, commonly known as the Florida flame anemone, is a rare and striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Florida Keys. It is characterized by its vibrant red, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall.</p>
<p>The plant produces a unique, showy inflorescence that attracts pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often form a rosette structure that helps collect and retain moisture.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
