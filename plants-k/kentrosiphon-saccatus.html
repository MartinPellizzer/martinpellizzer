<p>Kentrosiphon saccatus, commonly known as the sac-like bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous.</p>
<p>Kentrosiphon saccatus is primarily found in temperate regions and is often considered an indicator of clean, oxygen-rich water.</p>
