                    <h1>Kyllinga parvula</h1>
<p>Kyllinga parvula, commonly known as little spikerush, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often forming dense stands in marshes and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to reddish flowers. Its rhizomes help it spread vegetatively, contributing to its ability to colonize wetland habitats.</p>
<p>Kyllinga parvula plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.</p>
