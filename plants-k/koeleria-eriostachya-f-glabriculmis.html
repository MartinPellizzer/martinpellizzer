<p>Koeleria eriostachya f. glabriculmis, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed winter grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features slender, cylindrical stems that are typically hairless or nearly so, giving it its distinguishing name. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that helps it blend into its arid habitat.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to thrive in dry, open environments, often found in meadows and along rocky slopes.</p>
