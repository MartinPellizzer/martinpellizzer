                    <h1>Kali basalticum</h1>
<p>Kali basalticum, commonly known as the basaltic saltbush, is a hardy shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers.</p>
<p>Kali basalticum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in poor conditions.</p>
