                    <h1>Kobresia hissarica</h1>
<p>Kobresia hissarica, commonly known as the Karakum grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, particularly in the steppes and deserts of Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in the summer. It plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes.</p>
