                    <h1>Kobresia helanshanica</h1>
<p>Kobresia helanshanica, commonly known as the Helan Mountain kobresia, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the arid regions of China, particularly in the Helan Mountains.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions such as drought and strong winds. Kobresia helanshanica plays an important role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it a notable species in the study of alpine and arid plant communities.</p>
