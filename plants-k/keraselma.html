                    <h1>Keraselma</h1>
<p>Keraselma, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and delicate, white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Keraselma thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species in many areas.</p>
