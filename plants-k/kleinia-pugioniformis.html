                    <h1>Kleinia pugioniformis</h1>
<p>Kleinia pugioniformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a white, powdery coating called farina, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or yellow, often blooming during the winter months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and strong winds.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid gardens.</p>
