<p>Kjellbergia celebica, commonly known as the Celebes cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the Moluccas in Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants due to their striking appearance.</p>
<p>Kjellbergia celebica is also of interest to botanists for its evolutionary significance and ecological role in its native habitat.</p>
