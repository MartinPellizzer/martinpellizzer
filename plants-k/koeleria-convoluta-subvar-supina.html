                    <h1>Koeleria convoluta subvar. supina</h1>
<p>Koeleria convoluta subvar. supina, commonly known as the creeping wiregrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats on the ground, with slender, curling leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its compact growth habit makes it an important component of native grassland ecosystems.</p>
