                    <h1>Koeleria cristata var. avenacea</h1>
<p>Koeleria cristata var. avenacea, commonly known as the tufted grass or the wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a forage crop or for ornamental purposes in cooler climates.</p>
