                    <h1>Kielmeyera corymbosa var. corymbosa</h1>
<p>Kielmeyera corymbosa var. corymbosa, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America.</p>
<p>It features glossy, dark green, elliptical leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in terminal clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is sometimes considered a problematic weed in certain regions.</p>
