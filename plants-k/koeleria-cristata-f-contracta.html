                    <h1>Koeleria cristata f. contracta</h1>
<p>Koeleria cristata f. contracta, commonly known as the compact form of the tufted grass, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features dense, compact clumps of slender, blue-green leaves that are typically shorter and more upright than the typical form. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, pale blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its compact growth habit, it is often used in ornamental horticulture for its fine texture and hardy nature.</p>
