                    <h1>Kohleria diastemoides</h1>
<p>Kohleria diastemoides, commonly known as the pink ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with elongated, pale pink flowers that resemble spectral forms. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in the understory of tropical forests. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, rather than soil.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Kohleria diastemoides is considered a delicate and endangered species in its natural range.</p>
