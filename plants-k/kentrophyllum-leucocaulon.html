The plant is characterized by its slender, white-veined stems and small, clustered white to pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with a fine, waxy coating.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment.</p>
