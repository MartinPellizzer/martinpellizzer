                    <h1>Koeleria gracilis f. subpubiglumis</h1>
<p>Koeleria gracilis f. subpubiglumis, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features fine, thread-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers. The plant is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, which helps it thrive in harsh, dry environments. Its foliage is typically blue-green in color, and it is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.</p>
<p>The subspecies subpubiglumis is distinguished by its pubescent (hairy) lemma tips, which contribute to its unique botanical identity.</p>
