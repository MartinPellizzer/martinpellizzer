                    <h1>Koeleria tuberculosa</h1>
<p>Koeleria tuberculosa, commonly known as the tufted grass or mountain grass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass that typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high elevations. The plant has slender, tufted leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed or barren areas.</p>
<p>Koeleria tuberculosa is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and birds.</p>
