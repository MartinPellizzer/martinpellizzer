                    <h1>Kleinia cylindrica</h1>
<p>Kleinia cylindrica, commonly known as the cylindrical Kleinia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features a compact, upright growth habit with dense clusters of narrow, cylindrical leaves that are often covered in a whitish powdery coating. The leaves are typically green to bluish-green and have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, yellowish flowers during the summer months, adding a subtle ornamental value to the plant.</p>
<p>This species is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and attractive appearance.</p>
