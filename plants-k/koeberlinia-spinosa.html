                    <h1>Koeberlinia spinosa</h1>
<p>Koeberlinia spinosa, commonly known as the desert broom, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has adapted to harsh desert conditions with deep roots and a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its leaves are typically narrow and leathery, and it produces small, hard pods that contain several seeds.</p>
<p>Koeberlinia spinosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
