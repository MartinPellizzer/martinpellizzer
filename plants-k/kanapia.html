                    <h1>Kanapia</h1>
<p>Kanapia, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth surface. Kanapia flowers are small and yellow, typically appearing in clusters, and it produces woody pods containing flat, winged seeds.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species in many regions.</p>
