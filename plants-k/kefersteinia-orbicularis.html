<p>Kefersteinia orbicularis, commonly known as the round-leaved kefersteinia, is a rare and unique member of the Apiaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its orbicular, or nearly round, leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
