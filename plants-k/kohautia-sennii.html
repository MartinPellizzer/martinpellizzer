<p>Kohautia sennii, commonly known as the Senni's kohautia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Kohautia sennii thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the cool, humid climate of its native habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental changes.</p>
