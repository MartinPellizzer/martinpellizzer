                    <h1>Kochia maritima</h1>
<p>Kochia maritima, commonly known as sea kochia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, feather-like bracts that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant is adapted to saline and sandy soils, making it a common sight in dune environments. It produces small greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and its seeds are dispersed by wind.</p>
<p>Kochia maritima is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize coastal soils.</p>
