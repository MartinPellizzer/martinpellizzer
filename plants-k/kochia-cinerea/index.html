<p>Whiteweed, scientifically known as Kochia cinerea, is a hardy annual plant native to North America. It is commonly found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and wastelands. The plant is characterized by its fluffy, white seed heads that resemble small clouds, giving it its common name. Despite its invasive tendencies, it has been used historically for medicinal and practical purposes. Its resilience and adaptability make it a notable species in ecological and agricultural contexts.</p>
