<p>Kochia triptera, commonly known as the sea bladder, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it well-adapted to coastal environments. Its ability to store water in its leaves helps it survive in arid and windy conditions.</p>
<p>Kochia triptera is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize dunes.</p>
