<p>Koeleria macrantha var. rigidula, commonly known as rigid tufted grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, white to pale blue flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and a deep root system.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in poor soils.</p>
