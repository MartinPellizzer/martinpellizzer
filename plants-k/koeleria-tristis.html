<p>Koeleria tristis, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to North America.</p>
<p>It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and features slender, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Koeleria tristis is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and its resilience to harsh environmental conditions.</p>
