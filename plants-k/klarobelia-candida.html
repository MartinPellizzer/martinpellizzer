                    <h1>Klarobelia candida</h1>
<p>Klarobelia candida, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking white petals and sepals, which resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. Its flowers bloom in clusters and are pollinated by specific species of moths and bees.</p>
<p>Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Klarobelia candida is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
