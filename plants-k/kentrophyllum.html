                    <h1>Kentrophyllum</h1>
<p>Kentrophyllum, commonly known as the "spleenwort," is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Pterobryaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are characterized by their small, delicate fronds and are typically found growing on rocks or in shaded, moist environments. Kentrophyllum species are often epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. They play a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, each with unique morphological features that aid in their survival in diverse habitats.</p>
