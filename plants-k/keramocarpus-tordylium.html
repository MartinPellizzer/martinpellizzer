                    <h1>Keramocarpus tordylium</h1>
<p>Keramocarpus tordylium, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a deep taproot system that allows it to survive in hot, dry environments by accessing groundwater. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, reducing water loss through transpiration.</p>
<p>Keramocarpus tordylium is also known for its ability to reseed itself after wildfires, contributing to the ecological resilience of its habitat.</p>
