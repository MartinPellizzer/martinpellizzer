<p>Kernera saxatilis subsp.</p>
<p>saxatilis, commonly known as the rock kernera, is a perennial herb native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a dense, spike-like inflorescence. It typically grows in rocky soils and is found in coastal and inland regions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil.</p>
