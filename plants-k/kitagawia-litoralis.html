                    <h1>Kitagawia litoralis</h1>
<p>Kitagawia litoralis, commonly known as the coastal bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its bell-shaped, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it is exposed to salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh coastal environment.</p>
<p>Kitagawia litoralis plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates.</p>
