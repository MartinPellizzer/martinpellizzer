<p>Kyllinga afro-occidentalis, commonly known as African arrowhead, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and the Americas.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. The plant has arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often floating or semi-submerged, with a smooth, waxy surface. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikes, and it produces tiny, three-lobed seeds.</p>
<p>Kyllinga afro-occidentalis is known for its rapid growth and is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native habitats.</p>
