                    <h1>Koeleria cristata var. robusta</h1>
<p>Koeleria cristata var. robusta, commonly known as the tufted grass or mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and compact, upright clumps that form a low-growing mat. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in difficult conditions.</p>
