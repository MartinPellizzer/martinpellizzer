                    <h1>Kalanchoe angustifolia</h1>
<p>Kalanchoe angustifolia, commonly known as the Narrow-leaf Kalanchoe, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, narrow leaves that are often covered in a powdery white coating, known as a cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically during the winter months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation.</p>
<p>Kalanchoe angustifolia is also noted for its ability to propagate through leaf cuttings, a characteristic common in many Kalanchoe species.</p>
