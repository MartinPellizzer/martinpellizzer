<p>Kaunia pachanoi, commonly known as the Andean puffball, is a species of fungus that grows in the high-altitude regions of the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, spore-filled sac-like structure that resembles a small, round puffball. The fungus is typically found on decaying wood and is often associated with specific tree species in its habitat. Its spores are dispersed by wind, contributing to its reproductive success in mountainous environments.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological role, it plays an important part in the nutrient cycling of its native ecosystems.</p>
