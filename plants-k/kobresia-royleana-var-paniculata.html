                    <h1>Kobresia royleana var. paniculata</h1>
<p>Kobresia royleana var. paniculata, commonly known as the Kashmir grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the cold regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in high-altitude environments with poor soil conditions and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
