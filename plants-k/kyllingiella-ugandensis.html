                    <h1>Kyllingiella ugandensis</h1>
<p>Kyllingiella ugandensis, commonly known as the Ugandan star moss, is a rare and unique moss species native to the mountainous regions of Uganda.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Dicranaceae and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form. The plant exhibits a delicate, star-shaped arrangement of its leaves, which are typically narrow and slightly curled. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or in shaded forest floors.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, Kyllingiella ugandensis is considered an important indicator species for montane ecosystems.</p>
