                    <h1>Kohautia lasiocarpa var. xerophila</h1>
<p>Kohautia lasiocarpa var. xerophila, commonly known as the desert flax, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid regions of South America.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation.</p>
<p>Due to its resilience, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a component of native plant gardens.</p>
