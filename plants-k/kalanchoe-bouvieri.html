                    <h1>Kalanchoe bouvieri</h1>
<p>Kalanchoe bouvieri, commonly known as the Christmas chandelier, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick and fleshy, adapted for storing water. The plant produces clusters of bright orange or yellow flowers during the winter months, which resemble a chandelier, hence its common name. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect sunlight.</p>
<p>Kalanchoe bouvieri is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal.</p>
