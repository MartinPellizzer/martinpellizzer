<p>Koeleria villosa subsp.</p>
<p>longiglumis, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine zones.</p>
<p>The plant features slender, tufted stems with hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, whitish pubescence. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-lipped flowers.</p>
<p>This subspecies is characterized by its distinctive glumes and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments.</p>
