<p>Koeleria caudata subsp.</p>
<p>crassipes, commonly known as the thickstem sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and stream banks.</p>
<p>The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil in wetland environments.</p>
<p>It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed, waterlogged soils.</p>
