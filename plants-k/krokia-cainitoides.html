                    <h1>Krokia cainitoides</h1>
<p>Krokia cainitoides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale green or white flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Krokia cainitoides is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
