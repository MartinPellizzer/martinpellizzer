                    <h1>Kefersteinia aurorae</h1>
<p>Kefersteinia aurorae, commonly known as the Aurora's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale yellow flowers that resemble the dawn's first light, hence its common name. The plant has a slender, erect stem with few leaves and produces small, intricate blooms that are often hidden among moss or rock crevices. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires specific conditions to flourish, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Kefersteinia aurorae is considered a conservation concern.</p>
