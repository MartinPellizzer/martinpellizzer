                    <h1>Kyllinga afropumila</h1>
<p>Kyllinga afropumila, commonly known as the African spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, reddish or brownish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil and prevent erosion.</p>
<p>Kyllinga afropumila is also known for its use in traditional medicine and as a potential ornamental plant.</p>
