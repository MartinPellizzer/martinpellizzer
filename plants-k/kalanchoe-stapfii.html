<p>Kalanchoe stapfii, commonly known as the silver arrow or dwarf kalanchoe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white powder, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the winter months. It is a compact species, often growing to only a few inches in height, making it ideal for small spaces.</p>
<p>Kalanchoe stapfii is drought-tolerant and requires well-draining soil to thrive.</p>
