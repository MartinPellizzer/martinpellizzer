                    <h1>Kissodendron australianum var. dispermum</h1>
<p>Kissodendron australianum var. dispermum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glaucous in appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by woody, bead-like fruits containing two seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry sclerophyll forests and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Due to its hard, durable wood, it has been historically used for fence posts and small tools.</p>
