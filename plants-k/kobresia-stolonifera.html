<p>Kobresia stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water and nutrient availability.</p>
<p>Kobresia stolonifera plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats.</p>
