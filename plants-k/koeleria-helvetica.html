<p>Koeleria helvetica, commonly known as the Alpine bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the alpine regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue or purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. Koeleria helvetica is adapted to harsh, rocky environments and is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes.</p>
<p>Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil in steep, unstable areas.</p>
