                    <h1>Koeleria pumila</h1>
<p>Koeleria pumila, commonly known as the dwarf needlegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It features slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in poor, rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered with a fine, silky hair.</p>
<p>Koeleria pumila plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
