                    <h1>Kuhnia critonia</h1>
<p>Kuhnia critonia, commonly known as the slender marsh fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in the Americas.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective layer called an indusium.</p>
<p>Kuhnia critonia plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates.</p>
