                    <h1>Keysseria rosulans</h1>
<p>Keysseria rosulans, commonly known as the Rosulate Keysseria, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit, with tightly packed, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming during the cooler months. Its leaves are covered in a fine, waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Keysseria rosulans is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
