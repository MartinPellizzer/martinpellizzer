                    <h1>Krascheninikovia rhaphanorrhiza</h1>
<p>Krascheninikovia rhaphanorrhiza, commonly known as the Antarctic hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to the cold environments of Antarctica and southern South America.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in extreme conditions, characterized by its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils and harsh climates. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Krascheninikovia rhaphanorrhiza plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems in its polar and subpolar habitats.</p>
