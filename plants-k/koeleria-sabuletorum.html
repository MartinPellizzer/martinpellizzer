<p>Koeleria sabuletorum, commonly known as the sand dropwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial grass that typically forms dense mats on sandy or gravelly soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads that are often white or pale blue in color. Koeleria sabuletorum is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive drought conditions.</p>
<p>It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small desert organisms.</p>
