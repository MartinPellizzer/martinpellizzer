<p>Kuhnia albicaulis, commonly known as the white-stemmed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and marshes of eastern North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in dense colonies, reaching heights of up to 60 cm, with slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a white or pale bloom. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in spike-like clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its moist habitat.</p>
<p>Kuhnia albicaulis plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.</p>
