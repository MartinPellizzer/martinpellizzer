                    <h1>Kali pellucidum</h1>
<p>Kali pellucidum, commonly known as the glassy saltbush, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Australia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late winter to early spring. Kali pellucidum is well adapted to saline soils and can thrive in areas with high salinity, making it a hardy species for coastal or inland salt-affected regions.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important plant for ecological studies and potential use in phytoremediation.</p>
