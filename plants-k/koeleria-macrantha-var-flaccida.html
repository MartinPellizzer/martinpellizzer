                    <h1>Koeleria macrantha var. flaccida</h1>
<p>Koeleria macrantha var. flaccida, commonly known as the flaccid wild oat, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender,丛生 growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, white to pale blue flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.</p>
<p>Its low-growing form and drought tolerance make it a common weed in agricultural and natural areas.</p>
