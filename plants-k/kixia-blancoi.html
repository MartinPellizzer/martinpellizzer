                    <h1>Kixia blancoi</h1>
<p>Kixia blancoi, commonly known as the white kixia, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its small, delicate white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a short stem with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a cool, humid climate.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Kixia blancoi is critically endangered and is protected in several botanical gardens.</p>
