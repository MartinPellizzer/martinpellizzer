<p>Kohautia arabica, commonly known as the Arabian kohautia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths.
