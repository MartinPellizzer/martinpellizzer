<p>Kleinia colorata, commonly known as the Cape marigold, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, compact growth with fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual appeal. Its leaves are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that reduces water loss.</p>
<p>Kleinia colorata is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
