<p>Kochia villosa var. tenuifolia, commonly known as slenderleaf kochia, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features upright, branching stems covered in fine, silky hairs, which give it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The leaves are narrow and linear, often with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense layer of trichomes. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by spiny, capsule-like fruits.</p>
<p>This plant is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and resilience.</p>
