                    <h1>Koeleria phleoides var. pseudolobulata</h1>
<p>Koeleria phleoides var. pseudolobulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine,丛生的 growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in width. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its low-growing nature and drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in native plant landscaping.</p>
