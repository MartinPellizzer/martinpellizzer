                    <h1>Kobresia kobresioidea</h1>
<p>Kobresia kobresioidea, commonly known as the Tibetan feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It forms dense, mat-like growths that help stabilize soil in arid and cold environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. It is adapted to harsh conditions, including strong winds and limited nutrients.</p>
<p>Kobresia kobresioidea plays an important ecological role in maintaining the stability of alpine and subalpine ecosystems.</p>
