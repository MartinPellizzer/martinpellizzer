                    <h1>Keratochlaena</h1>
<p>Keratochlaena, commonly known as the glass sponge or glassweed, is a type of marine sponge found in shallow coastal waters.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent body composed of a network of silica-based spicules. The structure of Keratochlaena resembles a glass-like lattice, giving it its common name. It thrives in areas with strong water currents, which help in filter feeding.</p>
<p>This unique botanical structure makes it an important component of marine ecosystems.</p>
