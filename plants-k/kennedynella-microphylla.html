                    <h1>Kennedynella microphylla</h1>
<p>Kennedynella microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf rock heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It features small, densely packed leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or coastal environments.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.</p>
