                    <h1>Kobresia mallae</h1>
<p>Kobresia mallae, commonly known as the Tibetan feather grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, silky foliage that gives it a soft, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its alpine habitat. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in these sensitive ecosystems.</p>
<p>Kobresia mallae is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with similar climatic conditions.</p>
