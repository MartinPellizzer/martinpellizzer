                    <h1>Kohautia obbiadensis</h1>
<p>Kohautia obbiadensis, commonly known as the Obbiad's kohautia, is a rare flowering plant native to the remote regions of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered at the base of the plant. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists studying plant biodiversity.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique species from further decline.</p>
