                    <h1>Kleinia spiculosa</h1>
<p>Kleinia spiculosa, commonly known as the rock fig or coastal dandelion, is a succulent shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features dense, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a white, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high salt levels and strong coastal winds.</p>
<p>Kleinia spiculosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in harsh conditions.</p>
