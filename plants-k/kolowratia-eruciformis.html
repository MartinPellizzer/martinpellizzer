<p>Kolowratia eruciformis, commonly known as the horned liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its leafy, thalloid structure and the presence of small, horn-like projections on its stems. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms.</p>
<p>Its simple morphology reflects its evolutionary adaptation to humid, nutrient-rich substrates.</p>
