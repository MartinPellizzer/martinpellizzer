<p>Koellia incana, commonly known as the silky koellia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, upright stems covered in fine, silvery hairs that give it a distinctive, silky appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its overall rugged, drought-resistant appearance.</p>
<p>Koellia incana is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments.</p>
