<p>Kohautia pleiocaulis, commonly known as the coastal kohautia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Kohautia pleiocaulis is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments.</p>
<p>Its conservation status is of concern due to habitat loss and invasive species encroachment.</p>
