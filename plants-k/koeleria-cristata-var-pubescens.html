                    <h1>Koeleria cristata var. pubescens</h1>
<p>Koeleria cristata var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy tufted grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy stems, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture that distinguishes it from other similar species.</p>
<p>It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats.</p>
