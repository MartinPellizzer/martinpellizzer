<p>Keraselma exiguum, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which it uses to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are thin and ribbon-like, often floating on the water surface.</p>
<p>Keraselma exiguum is a carnivorous plant, relying on both photosynthesis and the nutrients obtained from captured prey.</p>
