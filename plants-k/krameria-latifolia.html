<p>Krameria latifolia, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, characterized by its woody stems and dense, spiny branches. The plant produces showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>Krameria latifolia is also known for its fleshy, red berries that contain seeds dispersed by animals.</p>
