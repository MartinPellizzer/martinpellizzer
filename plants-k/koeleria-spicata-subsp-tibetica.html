<p>Koeleria spicata subsp.</p>
<p>tibetica, commonly known as Tibetan needlegrass, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet and adjacent areas of China. It is a perennial grass characterized by its slender, erect stems and dense spikes of small, spikelet-like flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cold and arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for local wildlife.</p>
