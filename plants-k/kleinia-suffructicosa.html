<p>Kleinia suffructicosa, commonly known as the rock fig or desert fig, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, lobed leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is well adapted to arid and rocky environments, storing water in its thick stems and leaves.</p>
<p>Kleinia suffructicosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance.</p>
