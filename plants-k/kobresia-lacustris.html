                    <h1>Kobresia lacustris</h1>
<p>Kobresia lacustris, commonly known as the lake kobresia, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, needle-like leaves. This plant is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, often found in coastal areas and salt lakes. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Kobresia lacustris plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
