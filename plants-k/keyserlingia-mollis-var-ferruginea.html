<p>Keyserlingia mollis var. ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty keyserlingia, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. The plant has a basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late summer. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine, rusty-colored hairs, which give it its common name.</p>
<p>This species is adapted to cold climates and is an important component of the vegetation in its native habitats.</p>
