                    <h1>Kolobopetalum tisserantii</h1>
<p>Kolobopetalum tisserantii, commonly known as the Tisserant's starflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which consists of small, star-shaped flowers clustered in a spherical arrangement. The plant belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is known for its delicate, often brightly colored blooms that appear in the spring. Its leaves are typically opposite and ovate, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy surface.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Kolobopetalum tisserantii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
