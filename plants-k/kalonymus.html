<p>Kalonymus, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a water-loving plant belonging to the Nelumbonaceae family.</p>
<p>It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Asia, where it thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can be pink, white, or yellow, depending on the species. Its leaves are broad and floating, often with a waxy surface that repels water.</p>
<p>Kalonymus plays a significant role in both ecological systems and cultural symbolism across various traditions.</p>
