                    <h1>Knifa</h1>
<p>Knifa, commonly known as the sea holly, is a hardy perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It features striking, silvery-blue leaves with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. The plant produces showy, dandelion-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its succulent foliage and ability to thrive in saline soils make it a popular choice for coastal gardens.</p>
<p>Knifa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in challenging maritime conditions.</p>
