                    <h1>Kobresia maquensis</h1>
<p>Kobresia maquensis, commonly known as the Maqu grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure, with slender, wiry stems and small, narrow leaves. The plant is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil in these harsh conditions, making it an important component of the local ecosystem.</p>
<p>Kobresia maquensis plays a role in preventing soil erosion and providing habitat for various alpine organisms.</p>
