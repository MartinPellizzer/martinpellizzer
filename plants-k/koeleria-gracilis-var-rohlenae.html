                    <h1>Koeleria gracilis var. rohlenae</h1>
<p>Koeleria gracilis var. rohlenae, commonly known as the slender rohlen's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada in California.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact, tufted growth habit, which help it survive in harsh, alpine conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant species.</p>
