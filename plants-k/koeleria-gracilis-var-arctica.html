                    <h1>Koeleria gracilis var. arctica</h1>
<p>Koeleria gracilis var. arctica, commonly known as Arctic Koeleria, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Arctic and alpine regions.</p>
<p>It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments, often found in tundra and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor in unstable soil and access moisture from deep underground.</p>
<p>This variety is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions, making it a resilient component of polar and high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
