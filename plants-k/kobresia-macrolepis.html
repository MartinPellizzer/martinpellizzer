                    <h1>Kobresia macrolepis</h1>
<p>Kobresia macrolepis, commonly known as the Tibetan feather grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and compact growth habit, which help it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant typically forms dense mats or cushions, which provide insulation against extreme temperatures. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to high UV radiation and strong winds.</p>
<p>Kobresia macrolepis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting alpine ecosystems.</p>
