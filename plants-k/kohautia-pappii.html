                    <h1>Kohautia pappii</h1>
<p>Kohautia pappii, commonly known as the Pappi's kohautia, is a rare and unique plant native to the volcanic soils of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like appearance with narrow, elongated leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds, a feature typical of many grass species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
<p>Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this rare botanical treasure from threats such as habitat loss and invasive species.</p>
