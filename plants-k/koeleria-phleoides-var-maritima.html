                    <h1>Koeleria phleoides var. maritima</h1>
<p>Koeleria phleoides var. maritima, commonly known as sea wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to coastal areas of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and salt marshes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to harsh coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and strong winds.</p>
<p>This species plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and preventing erosion.</p>
