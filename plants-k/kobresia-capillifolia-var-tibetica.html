                    <h1>Kobresia capillifolia var. tibetica</h1>
<p>Kobresia capillifolia var. tibetica, commonly known as Tibetan hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and fine, hair-like leaves that are often covered in a powdery bloom. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of alpine and subalpine ecosystems. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in these extreme habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is an important species for studying plant adaptations to high-altitude environments.</p>
