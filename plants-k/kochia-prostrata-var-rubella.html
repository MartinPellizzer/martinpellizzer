<p>Kochia prostrata var. rubella, commonly known as red tumbleweed, is a low-growing, annual plant characterized by its prostrate growth habit and vibrant red bracts.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. The plant features small, green, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Its striking red, feathery flowers appear in late summer, adding ornamental value to the landscape.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its ability to thrive in poor soils and with minimal water.</p>
