<p>Kirkia burgeri, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its thick, woody trunk and smooth, grayish bark. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences called cyathia. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Kirkia burgeri is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested.</p>
