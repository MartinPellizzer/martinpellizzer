                    <h1>Kobresia curvula</h1>
<p>Kobresia curvula, commonly known as the dwarf feather grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It forms dense, mat-like growths that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in harsh environments. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across open landscapes.</p>
<p>Kobresia curvula is well adapted to extreme conditions, thriving in areas with limited water and high temperatures.</p>
