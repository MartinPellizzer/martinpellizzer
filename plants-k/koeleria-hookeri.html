                    <h1>Koeleria hookeri</h1>
<p>Koeleria hookeri, commonly known as Hooker's oatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of North America.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant produces slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seed heads are often used in floral arrangements due to their delicate appearance.</p>
<p>Koeleria hookeri is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in harsh, high-altitude habitats.</p>
