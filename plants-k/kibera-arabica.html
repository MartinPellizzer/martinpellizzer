                    <h1>Kibera arabica</h1>
<p>Kibera arabica, commonly known as the African coffee plant, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the highlands of East Africa.</p>
<p>It thrives in regions with high altitudes, moderate temperatures, and well-drained, acidic soils. The plant produces small, red berries that contain two seeds, which are the source of the coffee beans. These beans are harvested, processed, and roasted to develop their characteristic aroma and flavor.</p>
<p>Kibera arabica is highly valued for its rich, complex taste and is a significant crop in the economies of several African countries.</p>
