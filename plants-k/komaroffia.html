                    <h1>Komaroffia</h1>
<p>Komaroffia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with white, ghostly blooms that resemble spectral forms. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It requires specific environmental conditions, including high humidity and filtered sunlight, to thrive.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and its low reproductive rate, Komaroffia is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.</p>
