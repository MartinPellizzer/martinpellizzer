                            <h1>Koeleria Cristata Var. Macrantha</h1>
<p>Koeleria cristata var. macrantha is a strikingly beautiful flowering plant known for its distinctive, feathery appearance. Native to the cold climates of the northern hemisphere, it thrives in alpine and arctic environments. Its delicate, branched inflorescence creates a soft, cloud-like effect that makes it a favorite among gardeners and botanists alike. This variety is often mistaken for its parent species due to its similar structure but stands out with its larger, more showy flowers. It is both a hardy and ornamental plant, suitable for rock gardens and as a wildflower in suitable climates.</p>
