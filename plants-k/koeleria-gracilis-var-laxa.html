<p>Koeleria gracilis var. laxa, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers produce lightweight seeds that are dispersed by the wind.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
