                    <h1>Kosteletzkya macrantha var. lignosa</h1>
<p>Kosteletzkya macrantha var. lignosa, commonly known as the hardy mangrove or coastal cordgrass, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stems and fibrous roots, which help it thrive in coastal areas and tidal zones. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variant is particularly resilient to saltwater and plays a vital role in stabilizing shorelines and supporting coastal ecosystems.</p>
