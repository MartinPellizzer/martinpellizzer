<p>Kuhnistera rosea, commonly known as the pink ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has slender, strap-like leaves and produces small, fragrant blooms that bloom once a year. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on the trunks of trees or in dense undergrowth.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Kuhnistera rosea is considered a conservation concern.</p>
