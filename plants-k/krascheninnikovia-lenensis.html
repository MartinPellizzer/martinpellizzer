<p>Krascheninnikovia lenensis, commonly known as the Siberian grass, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern regions of Russia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with dense, fine-textured foliage. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including permafrost and nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important component of tundra and alpine ecosystems.</p>
