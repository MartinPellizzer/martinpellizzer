<p>Kotschya capitulifera var. capitulifera, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its rosette-forming basal leaves and a tall, branching stem that bears a cluster of yellow flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds dispersed by wind. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in desert ecosystems.</p>
