<p>Koeleria sibirica, commonly known as Siberian needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of Siberia and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs.

It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or arctic tundra environments.</p>
<p>Koeleria sibirica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.</p>
