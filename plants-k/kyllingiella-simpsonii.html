<p>Kyllingiella simpsonii, commonly known as the Simpson's bladderworts, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific regions of South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used for trapping prey. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its morphology includes delicate, floating leaves and specialized organs for nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, Kyllingiella simpsonii is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
