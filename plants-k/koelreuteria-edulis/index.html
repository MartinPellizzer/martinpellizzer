                            <h1>Koelreuteria Edulis</h1>
<p>Chinese lantern tree, scientifically known as Koelreuteria edulis, is a striking ornamental tree native to China and widely appreciated for its vibrant, papery fruits. Its distinctive red or orange lantern-like seed pods turn from green to a fiery hue as they mature, creating a dramatic visual display in autumn. The tree is also valued for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil conditions, making it a popular choice in urban landscapes. With its showy foliage and long-lasting fruit, it adds both aesthetic and ecological value to gardens and public spaces. Despite its beauty, it is important to note that the seeds can be toxic if ingested, requiring caution in areas with children or pets.</p>
