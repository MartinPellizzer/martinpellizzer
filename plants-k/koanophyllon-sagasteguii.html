<p>Koanophyllon sagasteguii, commonly known as the Sagastegui's leafless plant, is a rare and specialized species native to the arid regions of Peru.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its unique morphology, including its reduced leaves and clustered inflorescences. The plant thrives in extreme desert conditions, demonstrating adaptations such as deep root systems and minimal water loss. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, relying on wind pollination rather than insect visitation.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species with significant ecological importance in its ecosystem.</p>
