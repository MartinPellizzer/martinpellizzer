                    <h1>Kyllinga monocephala var. latifolia</h1>
<p>Kyllinga monocephala var. latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf spikerush, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, three-lobed flowers. Its botanical structure is adapted for water-based propagation, with rhizomes that can spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>The species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
