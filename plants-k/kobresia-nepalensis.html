                    <h1>Kobresia nepalensis</h1>
<p>Kobresia nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal sedge, is a perennial grass species native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and India.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, low-growing clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a mat-like structure. This plant thrives in high-altitude meadows and alpine environments, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil in mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Kobresia nepalensis plays a vital ecological role in maintaining the integrity of alpine ecosystems and supporting local biodiversity.</p>
