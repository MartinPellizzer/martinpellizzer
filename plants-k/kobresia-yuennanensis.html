                    <h1>Kobresia yuennanensis</h1>
<p>Kobresia yuennanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan kobresia, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of Yunnan Province in China.</p>
<p>It thrives in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it forms dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in the summer months. It is adapted to cold, arid conditions and is often found in areas with limited nutrient availability.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance, it is considered a key species in maintaining the biodiversity of its native habitat.</p>
