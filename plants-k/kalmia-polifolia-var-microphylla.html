                    <h1>Kalmia polifolia var. microphylla</h1>
<p>Kalmia polifolia var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved mountain laurel, is a variant of the mountain laurel species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are small, ovate, and dark green, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture in its woodland habitat. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden landscapes.</p>
<p>The plant's botanical features make it an important component of the understory flora in eastern North American forests.</p>
