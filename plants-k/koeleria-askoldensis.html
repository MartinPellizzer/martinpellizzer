                    <h1>Koeleria askoldensis</h1>
<p>Koeleria askoldensis, commonly known as Askold's goatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of the Arctic and subarctic regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in open, rocky, or sandy soils and is adapted to low temperatures and short growing seasons. The plant has slender,丛生 stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with minute, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Koeleria askoldensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme climates.</p>
