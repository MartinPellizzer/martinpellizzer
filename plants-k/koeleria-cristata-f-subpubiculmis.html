<p>Koeleria cristata f. subpubiculmis, commonly known as the hairy bottlebrush grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence that resembles a bottlebrush, with bracts covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense layer of short hairs.</p>
