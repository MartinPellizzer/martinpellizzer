                    <h1>Kleinia lunulata</h1>
<p>Kleinia lunulata, commonly known as the moonflower of the Canary Islands, is a succulent plant native to the volcanic soils of La Palma.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Kleinia lunulata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to adapt to rocky, well-drained environments.</p>
