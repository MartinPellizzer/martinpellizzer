<p>Koeleria cristata var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender tufted grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and dense, tufted growth habit, often forming compact clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rocky or sandy landscapes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, it is often used in native plant gardens and restoration projects.</p>
