                    <h1>Katherinea fuscescens</h1>
<p>Katherinea fuscescens, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its woody stem and small, clustered leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are often white or pale pink, which bloom during the rainy season. Katherinea fuscescens is valued for its hard, dense wood, which has been historically used in traditional crafts and furniture.</p>
<p>However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a threatened species.</p>
