<p>Kalanchoe modesta, commonly known as the silver bush kalanchoe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, dark green leaves with a silvery-white underside, which help it store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces clusters of small, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red during the winter months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect sunlight.</p>
<p>Kalanchoe modesta is drought-tolerant and is often used in rock gardens or as a houseplant.</p>
