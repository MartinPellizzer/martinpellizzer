                    <h1>Koeleria schroeteriana var. glabriglumis</h1>
<p>Koeleria schroeteriana var. glabriglumis, commonly known as the smooth glume koeleria, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and slender, hairless stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with narrow, glabrous (smooth) lemmas, which distinguish it from other varieties of Koeleria. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.</p>
