                    <h1>Kyllinga repens</h1>
<p>Kyllinga repens, commonly known as swamp spikerush, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments.</p>
<p>It features a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively through underground stems. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, often covered with a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Kyllinga repens thrives in moist to waterlogged soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds.</p>
