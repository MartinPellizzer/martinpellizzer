<p>Krameria secundiflora, commonly known as the desert holly, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, branched stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces small, fleshy fruits that are typically consumed by various desert animals.</p>
<p>Krameria secundiflora is well-suited to xerophytic conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat.</p>
