                    <h1>Koeleria glauca var. albescens</h1>
<p>Koeleria glauca var. albescens, commonly known as the white koeleria, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features narrow, gray-green leaves and produces dense clusters of small, pale blue to white flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive drought conditions. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, and it serves as a valuable forage plant for livestock.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value comes from its compact growth habit and distinctive coloration.</p>
