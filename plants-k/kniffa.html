                    <h1>Kniffa</h1>
<p>Kniffa, commonly known as the desert thistle, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and yellow or purple flower heads that attract pollinators. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its fibrous roots help it retain moisture, and it often forms dense colonies in its native habitat.</p>
<p>Kniffa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally in some cultures for medicinal purposes.</p>
