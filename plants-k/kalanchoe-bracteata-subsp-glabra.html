<p>Kalanchoe bracteata subsp.</p>
<p>glabra, commonly known as the silver leaf kalanchoe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.</p>
<p>The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically during the winter months. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements.</p>
<p>The subspecies glabra distinguishes itself from other varieties by its smooth, hairless leaf surface.</p>
