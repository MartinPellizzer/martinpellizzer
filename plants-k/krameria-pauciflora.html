                    <h1>Krameria pauciflora</h1>
<p>Krameria pauciflora, commonly known as the desert candle, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stem that resembles a candle, and its small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water, featuring deep roots and thick, waxy leaves to reduce water loss. Krameria pauciflora is a member of the Capparaceae family and is often found in rocky soils and desert scrub habitats.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important species in its native ecosystem.</p>
