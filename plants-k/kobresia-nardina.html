                    <h1>Kobresia nardina</h1>
<p>Kobresia nardina, commonly known as the Tibetan feather grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-gray foliage that reflects its adaptation to harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing soil on rocky slopes. Kobresia nardina is well-suited to arid and semi-arid conditions, thriving in poor, well-drained soils.</p>
<p>It is an important component of alpine vegetation and is often used in ecological restoration projects in high-altitude areas.</p>
