                    <h1>Kobresia persica</h1>
<p>Kobresia persica, commonly known as Persian kobresia, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and limited water availability. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in dryland gardens for ornamental or functional purposes.</p>
