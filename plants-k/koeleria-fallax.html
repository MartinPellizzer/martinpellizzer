<p>Koeleria fallax, commonly known as the slender needlegrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of hairs.</p>
<p>Koeleria fallax is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat.</p>
