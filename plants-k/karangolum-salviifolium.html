                    <h1>Karangolum salviifolium</h1>
<p>Karangolum salviifolium, commonly known as the silverleaf sage, is a herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features aromatic, lance-shaped leaves covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, clustered blue or purple flowers during the cooler months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its medicinal properties have been traditionally used by indigenous communities for treating respiratory and digestive ailments.</p>
<p>The plant's resilience to drought and poor soil conditions makes it a valuable species for ecological restoration projects.</p>
