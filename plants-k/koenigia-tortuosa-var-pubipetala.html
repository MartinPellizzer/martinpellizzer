                    <h1>Koenigia tortuosa var. pubipetala</h1>
<p>Koenigia tortuosa var. pubipetala, commonly known as the zigzag rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid regions of southern Africa.</p>
<p>It features a sprawling habit with fleshy, succulent stems that often curl in a zigzag pattern, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white, woolly hair, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh environment.</p>
<p>This species is well adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens.</p>
