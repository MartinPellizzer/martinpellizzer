                    <h1>Koeleria gracilis subvar. superfusa</h1>
<p>Koeleria gracilis subvar. superfusa, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense mats of fine, grass-like foliage with narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous slender, spikelet-like flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is occasionally cultivated in native plant gardens.</p>
