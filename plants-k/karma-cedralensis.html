                <h1>Karma cedralensis</h1>
<p>Karma cedralensis, commonly known as the sacred flame plant, is a unique species native to the dense tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking red and orange foliage, which resembles a glowing flame, hence its common name. The plant possesses a woody stem with smooth, glossy bark and produces small, fragrant white flowers during the rainy season. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly waxy texture, adapting to the high humidity and intense sunlight of its natural habitat.</p>
<p>Due to its rarity and aesthetic appeal, Karma cedralensis is often cultivated in botanical gardens and is considered a symbol of resilience and spiritual growth.</p>
