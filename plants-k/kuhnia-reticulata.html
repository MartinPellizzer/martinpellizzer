                    <h1>Kuhnia reticulata</h1>
<p>Kuhnia reticulata, commonly known as the netleaf kuhnia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of North America.</p>
<p>It features slender, upright stems covered in a dense network of veins, giving it its distinctive reticulate appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clustered inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its moist habitat.</p>
<p>Kuhnia reticulata plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds.</p>
