                    <h1>Korshinskia kopetdaghensis</h1>
<p>Korshinskia kopetdaghensis, commonly known as the Kopetdag prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are modified into spiny structures, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores.</p>
<p>Korshinskia kopetdaghensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing food for local wildlife.</p>
