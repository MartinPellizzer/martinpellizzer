                    <h1>Kickxia adpressa</h1>
<p>Kickxia adpressa, commonly known as the flatweed or carpetweed, is a low-growing annual plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It has small, green, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern close to the ground. The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by slender, cylindrical seed pods. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in roadsides, fields, and garden beds.</p>
<p>Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it can become a weed in agricultural settings.</p>
