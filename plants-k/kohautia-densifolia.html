                    <h1>Kohautia densifolia</h1>
<p>Kohautia densifolia, commonly known as the dense-leaved kohautia, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its compact, grass-like appearance. The plant features dense, dark green foliage with narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery bloom. Kohautia densifolia produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikes, and it thrives in cool, moist environments.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation priority in its native range.</p>
