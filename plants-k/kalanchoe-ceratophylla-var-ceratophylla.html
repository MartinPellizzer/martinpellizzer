                    <h1>Kalanchoe ceratophylla var. ceratophylla</h1>
<p>Kalanchoe ceratophylla var. ceratophylla, commonly known as the flame flower or Christmas chrysanthemum, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to store water in its fleshy, thick leaves. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are covered in a fine, white powdery coating called farina, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Kalanchoe ceratophylla var. ceratophylla is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light.</p>
