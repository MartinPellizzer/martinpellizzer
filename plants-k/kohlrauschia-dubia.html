<p>Kohlrauschia dubia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, white, spider-like flowers that bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are long, thin, and often covered in a fine, silky hair.</p>
<p>Due to its unique appearance and limited habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species.</p>
