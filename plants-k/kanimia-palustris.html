                    <h1>Kanimia palustris</h1>
<p>Kanimia palustris, commonly known as the swamp kanimia, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in South America.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, exhibiting adaptations such as a fibrous root system for anchoring in soft substrates. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Kanimia palustris plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators.</p>
