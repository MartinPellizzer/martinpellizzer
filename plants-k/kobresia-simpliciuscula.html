                    <h1>Kobresia simpliciuscula</h1>
<p>Kobresia simpliciuscula, commonly known as the Tibetan feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It forms dense, mat-like colonies that stabilize fragile alpine soils and prevent erosion. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It is adapted to extreme environmental conditions, including cold temperatures and low oxygen levels.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance, it is often used in restoration projects in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
