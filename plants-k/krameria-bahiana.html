<p>Krameria bahiana, commonly known as the Brazilian candleplant, is a succulent shrub native to Brazil.</p>
<p>It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle, reducing water loss.</p>
<p>Krameria bahiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes due to its drought tolerance.</p>
