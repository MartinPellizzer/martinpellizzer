                            <h1>Knautia Montenegrina</h1>
<p>Montenegrin knautia, scientifically known as Knautia montenegrina, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Montenegro. This species belongs to the Asteraceae family, commonly known as the daisy or sunflower family, and is characterized by its striking pink to purple florets. Found primarily in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, it thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, the Montenegrin knautia is considered an endangered species, making it a subject of conservation interest. Its unique beauty and ecological significance highlight the importance of preserving such rare flora in the Balkan region.</p>
