<p>Kochia noeana, commonly known as the nodding kochia, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, bract-based inflorescences. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
