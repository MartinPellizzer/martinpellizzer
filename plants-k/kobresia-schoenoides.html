                    <h1>Kobresia schoenoides</h1>
<p>Kobresia schoenoides, commonly known as the Tibetan feather grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of Asia, particularly in Tibet and the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It forms dense, mat-like vegetation that thrives in cold, arid environments with poor soil conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically arranged in spikes and are adapted for wind pollination.</p>
<p>Kobresia schoenoides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife.</p>
