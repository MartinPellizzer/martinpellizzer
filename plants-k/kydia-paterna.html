<p>Kydia paterna, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, dry seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Kydia paterna is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability.</p>
<p>Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight.</p>
