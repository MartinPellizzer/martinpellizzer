<p>Koeleria kurtzii var. mollis, commonly known as the soft koeleria, is a low-growing, perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It features fine, silver-gray foliage that is densely packed, giving it a soft, fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flower spikes that bloom in early summer. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in poor soils.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.</p>
