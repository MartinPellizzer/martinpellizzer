                    <h1>Kissodendron</h1>
<p>Kissodendron, commonly known as the "poisonwood tree," is a tropical plant native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood and distinctive leaves with a waxy coating. The plant contains toxic compounds, particularly in its bark and leaves, which have been used in traditional medicine despite the risks. Its growth is often slow, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments.</p>
<p>The tree's botanical name, *Toxicodendron vernicifluum*, reflects its toxic properties and its ability to produce a resin.</p>
