<p>Kallstroemia peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular beargrass, is a unique plant native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, sandy soils along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered white or pink flowers in late spring.
