                    <h1>Kuhnistera candida var. diffusa</h1>
<p>Kuhnistera candida var. diffusa, commonly known as the white-flowered kuhnistera, is a rare and delicate plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its pale white petals and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often near streams or in dense undergrowth. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators such as moths and bees.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
