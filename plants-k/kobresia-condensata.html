                    <h1>Kobresia condensata</h1>
<p>Kobresia condensata, commonly known as the dense kobresia, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent areas of China, India, and Nepal.</p>
<p>It forms dense, cushion-like mats that help stabilize fragile alpine soils and prevent erosion. The plant has narrow, wiry leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in the harsh, cold environment. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny flowers, typically blooming in late summer.</p>
<p>Kobresia condensata plays an important ecological role in maintaining the biodiversity of alpine ecosystems.</p>
