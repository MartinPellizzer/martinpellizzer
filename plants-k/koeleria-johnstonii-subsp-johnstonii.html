<p>Koeleria johnstonii subsp.</p>
<p>johnstonii, commonly known as Johnston's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.</p>
<p>The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to high-altitude environments. It has narrow leaves with a rough texture and is often found in alpine and subalpine meadows.</p>
<p>This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution.</p>
