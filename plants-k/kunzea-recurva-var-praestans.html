                    <h1>Kunzea recurva var. praestans</h1>
<p>Kunzea recurva var. praestans, commonly known as the silver kunzea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense, overlapping scales on the leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and coastal heathlands.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.</p>
