<p>Koeleria phleoides subsp.</p>
<p>obtusiflora, commonly known as the broad-flowered koeleria, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in open, dry habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe.</p>
<p>The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with broad, lance-shaped flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife.</p>
