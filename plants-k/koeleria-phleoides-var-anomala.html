The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
