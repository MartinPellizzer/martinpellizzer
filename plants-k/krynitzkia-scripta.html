<p>Krynitzkia scripta, commonly known as the script lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically bright green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to thrive on rock surfaces in arid environments. It is often found in Mediterranean regions, where it grows on limestone and other calcareous substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for ecological health.</p>
