                    <h1>Kobresia pamiralaica</h1>
<p>Kobresia pamiralaica, commonly known as the Pamir hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia, particularly the Pamir Mountains.</p>
<p>It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and strong winds. The plant has a dense, mat-like growth habit, with fine, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Kobresia pamiralaica is also valued for its use in traditional pastoral practices in the region.</p>
