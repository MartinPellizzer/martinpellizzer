                    <h1>Kobresia setschwanensis</h1>
<p>Kobresia setschwanensis, commonly known as the Tibetan feather grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Asia, particularly in Tibet, Qinghai, and western China.</p>
<p>It thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant has fine, hair-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are characteristic of the Poaceae family. It plays a vital role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and limited water availability.</p>
<p>Due to its ecological importance, it is also considered a valuable indicator species for alpine ecosystems.</p>
