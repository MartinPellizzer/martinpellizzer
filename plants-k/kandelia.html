                    <h1>Kandelia</h1>
<p>Kandelia, commonly known as the mangrove tree, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Rhizophoraceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its salt-tolerant nature, allowing it to thrive in coastal and brackish water environments. Kandelia species typically have prop roots that help stabilize the soil and facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged conditions. These trees play a crucial role in coastal ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.</p>
<p>Their ability to filter pollutants makes them important in maintaining water quality in estuarine regions.</p>
