                    <h1>Krascheninnikovia ceratoides var. latifolia</h1>
<p>Krascheninnikovia ceratoides var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to the cold, arid regions of the Arctic and subarctic.</p>
<p>It features dense, low-growing foliage with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in harsh, nutrient-poor environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. Its stems are often prostrate or creeping, forming a mat-like structure that helps insulate the soil and reduce water loss.</p>
<p>This variety is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to other varieties of Krascheninnikovia, contributing to its unique appearance and ecological role.</p>
