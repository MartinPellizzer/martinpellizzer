                    <h1>Kobresia afghanica</h1>
<p>Kobresia afghanica, commonly known as Afghan hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Central Asia.</p>
<p>It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in mountainous regions and high-altitude meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny flowers. It is well adapted to harsh conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils.</p>
<p>Kobresia afghanica plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small animals in its native range.</p>
