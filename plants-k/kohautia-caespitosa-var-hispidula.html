<p>Kohautia caespitosa var. hispidula, commonly known as the hairy kohautia, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often covered with fine hairs, giving the plant its "hairy" appearance. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as along streambanks or in forest understories.</p>
<p>This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native invertebrates.</p>
