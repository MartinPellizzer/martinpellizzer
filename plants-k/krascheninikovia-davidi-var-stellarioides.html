<p>Krascheninikovia davidi var. stellarioides, commonly known as the silverleaf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate harsh conditions.</p>
