<p>Keysseria radicans, commonly known as the creeping keyssera, is a low-growing perennial plant native to tropical regions.</p>
<p>It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white or pale yellow.</p>
<p>This plant is often used in ornamental gardening for its ability to form dense, mat-like ground cover.</p>
