                    <h1>Kalanchoe connata</h1>
<p>Kalanchoe connata, commonly known as the rock kalanchoe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow during the winter months. Its stems are typically short and branched, and it is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils.</p>
<p>Kalanchoe connata is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value.</p>
