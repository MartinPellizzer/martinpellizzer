                    <h1>Karatas sarmentosa</h1>
<p>Karatas sarmentosa, commonly known as the creeping karatas, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by oval, woody fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are usually small, narrow, and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits.</p>
