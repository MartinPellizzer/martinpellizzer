                    <h1>Kohautia effusa</h1>
<p>Kohautia effusa, commonly known as the slender kohautia, is a species of flowering plant native to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas, often in the understorey. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture, and it produces delicate, pale green to brown flowers.</p>
<p>Kohautia effusa is a relatively rare species, and its conservation status is of concern due to habitat loss and limited distribution.</p>
