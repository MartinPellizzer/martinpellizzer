                            <h1>Khaya Anthotheca</h1>
<p>Ironwood tree, scientifically known as Khaya anthotheca, is a towering evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Africa. This majestic species is renowned for its exceptionally dense and durable wood, which has been highly valued for centuries. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall, with a broad canopy that provides shade and habitat for various wildlife. Its leaves are large and palmately lobed, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Despite its resilience, the Ironwood tree faces threats from deforestation and overexploitation, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival.</p>
