<p>Kobresia scirpina, commonly known as the tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers.</p>
<p>Kobresia scirpina plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine flora and fauna.</p>
