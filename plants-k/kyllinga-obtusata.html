                    <h1>Kyllinga obtusata</h1>
<p>Kyllinga obtusata, commonly known as broadleaf spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions.</p>
<p>It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant features upright, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of white or pink flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies.</p>
<p>Kyllinga obtusata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life.</p>
