<p>Kaufmannia, commonly known as the desert lily, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asparagaceae.</p>
<p>These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. Kaufmannia species are characterized by their tall, spikelike inflorescences and showy, often fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. They have adapted to harsh environments with deep root systems and thick, waxy leaves to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>The genus includes several species, such as Kaufmannia spinosa and Kaufmannia longiflora, which are valued for their ornamental beauty and ecological importance.</p>
