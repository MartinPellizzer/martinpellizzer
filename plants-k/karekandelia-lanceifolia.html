<p>Karekandelia lanceifolia, commonly known as the lanceleaf karekandelia, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. It is adapted to survive in sandy soils and can withstand extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species.</p>
