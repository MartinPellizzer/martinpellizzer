                    <h1>Koeleria maritima</h1>
<p>Koeleria maritima, commonly known as sea wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments, where it helps stabilize sand dunes.</p>
<p>Koeleria maritima is valued for its ecological role in coastal ecosystems and its potential use in erosion control.</p>
