                    <h1>Koeleria gracilis var. acutifolia</h1>
<p>Koeleria gracilis var. acutifolia, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the colder regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color and grows in dense, low mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, including alpine and arctic tundra, where it thrives in poor soils.</p>
<p>This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
