<p>Kastnera, commonly known as silverleaf kalanchoe, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Crassulaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plants typically produce clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red. Kastnera species are native to southern Africa and are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their hardiness and attractive appearance.</p>
<p>They are also valued for their ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and require minimal water.</p>
