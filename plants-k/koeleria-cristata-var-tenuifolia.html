                    <h1>Koeleria cristata var. tenuifolia</h1>
<p>Koeleria cristata var. tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>It features a dense, mat-forming growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to harsh, cold environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.</p>
<p>Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates.</p>
