<p>Kalanchoe ellacombei, commonly known as the Mother of Millions, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powdery wax. The plant produces clusters of bright orange or yellow flowers during the winter months. It is a popular houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in a variety of conditions.</p>
<p>One of its most distinctive features is its ability to produce offsets, or "baby plants," along the edges of its leaves.</p>
