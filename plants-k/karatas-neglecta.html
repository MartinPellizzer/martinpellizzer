                    <h1>Karatas neglecta</h1>
<p>Karatas neglecta, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that allow it to colonize disturbed soils and rocky areas.</p>
<p>Karatas neglecta plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing food for desert wildlife.</p>
