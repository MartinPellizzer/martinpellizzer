                    <h1>Kalanchoe pubescens var. subsessilis</h1>
<p>Kalanchoe pubescens var. subsessilis, commonly known as the wooly kalanchoe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red during the winter months. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light.</p>
<p>The species is also noted for its ability to propagate through leaf cuttings, making it easy to grow and propagate.</p>
