                    <h1>Koeleria pubescens var. longiglumis</h1>
<p>Koeleria pubescens var. longiglumis, commonly known as the long glume koeleria, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender,丛生 growth habit and hairy foliage, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs.</p>
<p>This variety is often found in open, dry habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, where it contributes to soil stabilization and provides forage for grazing animals.</p>
