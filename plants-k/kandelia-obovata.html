                    <h1>Kandelia obovata</h1>
<p>Kandelia obovata, commonly known as the mangrove apple or white mangrove, is a salt-tolerant tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It has prop roots that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in tidal areas. The plant's leaves are alternate,革质 (leathery), and oval-shaped, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals.</p>
<p>Kandelia obovata plays a vital role in mangrove ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to coastal protection.</p>
