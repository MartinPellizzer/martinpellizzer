                    <h1>Koenigia alpina var. alpina</h1>
<p>Koenigia alpina var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine rockfoxfire, is a low-growing succulent native to the mountainous regions of Europe.</p>
<p>It features dense clusters of fleshy, blue-green leaves that form a rosette shape, adapted to retain moisture in arid, high-altitude environments. The plant produces vibrant red, orange, or yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine collections.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.</p>
