                    <h1>Karatas spectabilis</h1>
<p>Karatas spectabilis, commonly known as the Persian ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to the arid regions of Iran and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and thick, flaky bark that provides natural insulation against extreme temperatures. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for birds and some mammals. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in dry climates.</p>
