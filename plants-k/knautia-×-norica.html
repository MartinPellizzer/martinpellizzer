                    <h1>Knautia × norica</h1>
<p>Knautia × norica, commonly known as the hybrid meadow knautia, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe.</p>
<p>It is a cross between Knautia arvenis and Knautia macedonica, resulting in a plant with a compact growth habit and dense foliage. The species produces clusters of pink to purple, fluffy flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and wildflower meadows.</p>
<p>Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to naturalize and form a carpet of color in suitable conditions.</p>
