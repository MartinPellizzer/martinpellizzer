                    <h1>Klasea × bogdensis</h1>
<p>Klasea × bogdensis, commonly known as the hybrid bog lichen, is a composite organism formed through the union of two distinct lichen species.</p>
<p>It consists of a fungal partner, typically a member of the Ascomycota, and a photobiont, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium. The plant exhibits a thallus structure that is often crustose or foliose, depending on environmental conditions. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, commonly found in forested areas with high humidity.</p>
<p>Due to its unique composition, it plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its habitat.</p>
