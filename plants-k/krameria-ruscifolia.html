<p>Krameria ruscifolia, commonly known as the desert holly, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its spiny, evergreen foliage and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has adapted to harsh, dry environments through its succulent leaves and deep root system, which help it conserve water. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.</p>
<p>Krameria ruscifolia plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for various desert wildlife.</p>
