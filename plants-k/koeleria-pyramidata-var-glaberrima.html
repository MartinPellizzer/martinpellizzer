<p>Koeleria pyramidata var. glaberrima, commonly known as the glabrous pyramidal grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically glabrous, or smooth, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.</p>
