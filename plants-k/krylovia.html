                    <h1>Krylovia</h1>
<p>Krylovia, commonly known as the fairy wing plant, is a rare flowering species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves that resemble wings, giving it its ethereal common name. The plant produces small, pale blue flowers that bloom in the early spring, attracting pollinators like moths and bees. Krylovia thrives in cool, moist environments and requires partial shade to flourish.</p>
<p>Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike.</p>
