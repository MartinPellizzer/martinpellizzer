                <h1>Kali tamariscinum</h1>
<p>Kali tamariscinum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in humid climates and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks.</p>
<p>Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions.</p>
