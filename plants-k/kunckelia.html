                    <h1>Kunckelia</h1>
<p>Kunckelia, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its trumpet-shaped, funnel-like flowers that open in the early morning and close by midday. The plant has thick, succulent stems and leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. Kunckelia typically grows from 30 to 100 centimeters tall and produces small, bean-like fruits.</p>
<p>Its ability to thrive in drought conditions makes it an important species in xerophytic ecosystems.</p>
