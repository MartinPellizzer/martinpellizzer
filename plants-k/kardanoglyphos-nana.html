                    <h1>Kardanoglyphos nana</h1>
<p>Kardanoglyphos nana, commonly known as the dwarf rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the rocky and arid regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It features small, spiny stems and produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish flowers during the summer months. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found on limestone or sandy substrates.</p>
<p>Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant.</p>
