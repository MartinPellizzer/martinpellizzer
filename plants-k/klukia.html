                    <h1>Klukia</h1>
<p>Klukia, commonly known as the marsh clubmoss, is a genus of small, evergreen plants belonging to the family Microsorum.</p>
<p>These plants are typically found in moist, shady environments such as bogs and wetlands. Klukia species are characterized by their creeping rhizomes and small, scale-like leaves. They produce spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in cone-like formations.</p>
<p>Klukia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various microorganisms.</p>
