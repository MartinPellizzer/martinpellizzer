                    <h1>Keracia polyodon</h1>
<p>Keracia polyodon, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its distinctive blue or purple flower heads surrounded by spiny, leaf-like bracts. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found along rocky shores and dunes. Its leaves are narrow and slightly succulent, adapted to reduce water loss in coastal environments.</p>
<p>Keracia polyodon plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.</p>
