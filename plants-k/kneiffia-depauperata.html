<p>Kneiffia depauperata, commonly known as the sparse kniphofia, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Asphodelaceae and is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its foliage is narrow and linear, with a fibrous root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor conditions.</p>
<p>Kneiffia depauperata is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.</p>
