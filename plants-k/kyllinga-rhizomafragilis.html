<p>Kyllinga rhizomafragilis, commonly known as swamp spikerush, is a flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae.</p>
<p>It is native to wetland areas in the Americas and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with slender, triangular stems. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in shallow water or moist soil.</p>
<p>Kyllinga rhizomafragilis plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms.</p>
