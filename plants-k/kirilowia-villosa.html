<p>Kirilowia villosa, commonly known as the hairy rockfoil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.</p>
<p>Kirilowia villosa is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds.</p>
