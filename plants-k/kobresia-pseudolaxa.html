                    <h1>Kobresia pseudolaxa</h1>
<p>Kobresia pseudolaxa, commonly known as the Tibetan feather grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of Asia, particularly in Tibet and Nepal.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, silky leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of short, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Kobresia pseudolaxa thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.</p>
<p>Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
