                    <h1>Kochia prostrata var. canescens</h1>
<p>Kochia prostrata var. canescens, commonly known as silverleaf kochia, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It features narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spiky inflorescences. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping.</p>
<p>Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in some regions.</p>
