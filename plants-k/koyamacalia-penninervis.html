                    <h1>Koyamacalia penninervis</h1>
<p>Koyamacalia penninervis, commonly known as the slender-veined koyama, is a rare and unique plant species native to the mountainous regions of Japan.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, narrow leaves with fine, parallel veins, which give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-white in color, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by animals.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Koyamacalia penninervis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
