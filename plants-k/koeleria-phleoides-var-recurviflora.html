<p>Koeleria phleoides var. recurviflora, commonly known as the recurved feathergrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is a perennial grass characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, feathery inflorescences that give it a delicate, ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically pale blue to purple in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairies, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and attractive foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in native plant gardens.</p>
