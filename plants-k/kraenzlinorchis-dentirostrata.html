                    <h1>Kraenzlinorchis dentirostrata</h1>
<p>Kraenzlinorchis dentirostrata, commonly known as the toothed beak orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a prominent, toothed lip that distinguishes it from other orchid species. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually pale green to white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
