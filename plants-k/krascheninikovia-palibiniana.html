<p>Krascheninikovia palibiniana, commonly known as the Antarctic hair grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the extreme environments of Antarctica and sub-Antarctic regions.</p>
<p>It has a compact, cushion-like growth form that helps it survive in harsh, cold climates with strong winds and minimal soil. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine, silky hairs that reduce water loss and protect against desiccation. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in dense spikes, typical of the Poaceae family.</p>
<p>Krascheninikovia palibiniana is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is a key component of the vegetation in polar desert ecosystems.</p>
