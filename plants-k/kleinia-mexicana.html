<p>Kleinia mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America.</p>
<p>It features dense, fleshy foliage that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Kleinia mexicana is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a resilient addition to xeriscapes.</p>
