                    <h1>Klossia montana</h1>
<p>Klossia montana, commonly known as the Kloss mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the high altitudes of Indonesia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, and its delicate, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within cloud forests, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Klossia montana is noted for its small size and intricate floral structure, which is adapted for pollination by specific insect species.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.</p>
