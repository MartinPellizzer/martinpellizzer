<p>Koeleria schinzii, commonly known as the Schinz's grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are usually pale blue or purple in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments.</p>
<p>Koeleria schinzii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soils in harsh mountainous habitats.</p>
