<p>Koyamacalia chenopodiifolia, commonly known as the desert spinach, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are edible and have a mild, spinach-like flavor, making it a traditional food source for some indigenous communities.</p>
<p>The plant's ability to thrive in poor soil conditions makes it an important species in ecological restoration efforts.</p>
