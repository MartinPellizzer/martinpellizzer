                    <h1>Kobresia bistaminata</h1>
<p>Kobresia bistaminata, commonly known as the Tibetan feather grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of Asia, particularly in the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
<p>It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and poor soil conditions. The plant has fine, wiry leaves that form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in its native habitat. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the base of the plant.</p>
<p>Kobresia bistaminata plays an important ecological role in preventing soil erosion and maintaining the fragile ecosystems of high-altitude regions.</p>
