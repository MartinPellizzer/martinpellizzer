<p>Krylovia eremophila, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its low-growing, succulent stems and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has adapted to harsh environments through thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss and deep root systems for accessing groundwater. It blooms during the brief rainy season, making it a key species in desert ecosystems.</p>
<p>Krylovia eremophila is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.</p>
