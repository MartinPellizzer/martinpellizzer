<p>Krameria imparata, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of small, red flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils, and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are often reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss, while its flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>Krameria imparata is also known for its medicinal properties, with some traditional uses in herbal remedies.</p>
