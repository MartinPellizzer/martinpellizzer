                    <h1>Koeleria cristata var. shiraensis</h1>
<p>Koeleria cristata var. shiraensis, commonly known as the Shira's tufted grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the arid regions of western North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.</p>
<p>Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscapes and native plant gardens.</p>
