                    <h1>Kinostemon pernyi var. ningpoensis</h1>
<p>Kinostemon pernyi var. ningpoensis, commonly known as the Ningpo cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to China.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers a subtropical climate.</p>
<p>Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range.</p>
