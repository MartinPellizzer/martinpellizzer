                    <h1>Krascheninnikovia latens</h1>
<p>Krascheninnikovia latens, commonly known as the sand couch grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in dense clusters, and it is well-suited for stabilizing sandy soils. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it an effective pioneer species in disturbed or barren landscapes.</p>
<p>Krascheninnikovia latens is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to prevent soil erosion.</p>
