<p>Kalanchoe bracteata, commonly known as the flaming Katy, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it store water. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically during the winter months. Its leaves are also notable for their ability to propagate new plants through a process called leaf cuttings.</p>
<p>Kalanchoe bracteata is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and long-lasting blooms.</p>
