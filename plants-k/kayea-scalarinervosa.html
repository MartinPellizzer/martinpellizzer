                    <h1>Kayea scalarinervosa</h1>
<p>Kayea scalarinervosa, commonly known as the scalycostly fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories. Its leaves are bioluminescent, a rare trait among ferns, which helps in attracting nocturnal pollinators.</p>
<p>The reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.</p>
