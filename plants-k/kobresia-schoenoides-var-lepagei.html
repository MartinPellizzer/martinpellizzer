                    <h1>Kobresia schoenoides var. lepagei</h1>
<p>Kobresia schoenoides var. lepagei, commonly known as the Lepage's sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent areas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit, often forming mats or cushions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to harsh alpine conditions.</p>
<p>This species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological significance in high-altitude ecosystems.</p>
