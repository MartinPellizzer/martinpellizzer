<p>Kyllinga flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible spikerush, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the Americas.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with slender, ribbed stems that often curve and twist, giving it a flexible structure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, typically appearing in late summer or early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and tapering, often with a slightly waxy surface that helps it retain moisture.</p>
<p>Kyllinga flexuosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.</p>
