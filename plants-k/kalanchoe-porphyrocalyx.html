<p>Kalanchoe porphyrocalyx, commonly known as the red-veined kalanchoe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming in winter. Its leaves have a distinctive purplish or red vein pattern, which gives it its common name.</p>
<p>Kalanchoe porphyrocalyx is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established.</p>
