<p>Korshinskia bupleuroides, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that help it retain water in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that disperse its seeds by wind. It is adapted to survive in sandy soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
<p>Its botanical features make it an important plant in desert ecosystems and a subject of study in xerophytic botany.</p>
