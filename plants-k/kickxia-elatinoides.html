<p>Kickxia elatinoides, commonly known as the sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow or white flowers, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.</p>
<p>Kickxia elatinoides is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession.</p>
