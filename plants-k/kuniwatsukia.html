<p>Kuniwatsukia, commonly known as the Japanese water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to East Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that float on the water surface. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.</p>
<p>Kuniwatsukia plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.</p>
