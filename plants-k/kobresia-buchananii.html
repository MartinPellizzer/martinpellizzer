<p>Kobresia buchananii, commonly known as the Buchanan's sedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family.</p>
<p>It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. Native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, it thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats.</p>
<p>Its morphology reflects evolutionary adaptations to survive in nutrient-poor and water-scarce environments.</p>
