                    <h1>Kentia rupicola</h1>
<p>Kentia rupicola, commonly known as the rock kentia, is a species of cycad native to Australia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and its feathery, compound leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, making it suitable for indoor cultivation.</p>
<p>Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often grown as a decorative plant in gardens and greenhouses.</p>
