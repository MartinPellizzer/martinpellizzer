                    <h1>Knema furfuracea</h1>
<p>Knema furfuracea, commonly known as the hairy knema, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often clustered together, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Knema furfuracea is typically found in lowland and hill forest areas, often in shaded understory conditions.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a relatively rare and less commonly cultivated species.</p>
