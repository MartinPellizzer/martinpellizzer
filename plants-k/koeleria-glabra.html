                    <h1>Koeleria glabra</h1>
<p>Koeleria glabra, commonly known as the smooth koeleria, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and smooth, contributing to its common name, while its seeds are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread.</p>
<p>Koeleria glabra is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.</p>
