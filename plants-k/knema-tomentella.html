<p>Knema tomentella, commonly known as the woolly knema, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Myristicaceae and is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by edible, orange-colored berries. Its leaves are thick and leathery, often with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in humid environments.</p>
<p>Knema tomentella is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits and is also used in ornamental horticulture.</p>
