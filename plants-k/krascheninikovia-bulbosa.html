                    <h1>Krascheninikovia bulbosa</h1>
<p>Krascheninikovia bulbosa, commonly known as the Antarctic hair grass, is a flowering plant native to the cold, arid regions of Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic islands.</p>
<p>It is a perennial herb that forms dense mats of grass-like foliage, adapted to survive in extreme environmental conditions. The plant has small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny white or pale blue flowers. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.</p>
<p>Krascheninikovia bulbosa plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems in its extreme environment.</p>
