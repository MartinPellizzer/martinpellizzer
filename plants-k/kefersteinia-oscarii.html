                    <h1>Kefersteinia oscarii</h1>
<p>Kefersteinia oscarii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States.</p>
<p>It is a lithophytic plant, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, and is adapted to thrive in shaded, humid environments. The plant has a distinctive appearance with long, narrow leaves and a single, delicate white or greenish-white flower. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the rocky substrate.</p>
<p>Due to its habitat specificity and threats from habitat loss, Kefersteinia oscarii is considered endangered.</p>
