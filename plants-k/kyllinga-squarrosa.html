<p>Kyllinga squarrosa, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States.</p>
<p>It features dense, mat-forming foliage with soft, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive, woolly appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.</p>
<p>Kyllinga squarrosa is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation.</p>
