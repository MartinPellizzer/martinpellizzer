<p>Kneiffia charlesii, commonly known as the Charlesii fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that emerge from a creeping rhizome. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its leaves are typically green and glossy, with a subtle, fern-like texture that adds to its ornamental appeal.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Kneiffia charlesii is considered a rare and endangered species.</p>
