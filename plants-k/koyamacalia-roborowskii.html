                    <h1>Koyamacalia roborowskii</h1>
<p>Koyamacalia roborowskii, commonly known as the Roborowskii koyamacalia, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Acanthaceae family.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or purple, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the branches. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires a cool, dry climate.</p>
<p>Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging plant for cultivation outside its native range.</p>
