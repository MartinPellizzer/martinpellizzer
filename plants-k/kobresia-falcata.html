<p>Kobresia falcata, commonly known as the bentleaf sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia.</p>
<p>It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and low moisture levels. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often curved or folded, giving it its common name. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family.</p>
