<p>Krascheninikovia heterantha, commonly known as the Antarctic hair grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the cold climates of Antarctica and sub-Antarctic regions.</p>
<p>It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in clusters, which are pollinated by wind rather than insects. It thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is well adapted to withstand extreme cold and high winds.</p>
<p>Krascheninikovia heterantha plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microscopic life in its extreme ecosystem.</p>
