                    <h1>Koeleria getica</h1>
<p>Koeleria getica, commonly known as the Tibetan grass or narrowleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of the Himalayas and Central Asia.</p>
<p>It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with low temperatures.</p>
<p>Koeleria getica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions.</p>
